We have a lot of cool celebrations that we're going to do.
The thing about their work
is that most people come to the door of furniture --
I suspect you probably recognize this chair
and some of the others I'm going to show you.
But we're going to first enter through the door of the Big Top.
The whole thing about this, though, is that, you know, why am I showing it?
Is it because Charles and Ray made this film?
This is actually a training film for a clown college that they had.
They also practiced a clown act when the future of furniture
was not nearly as auspicious as it turned out to be.
There is a picture of Charles. So let's watch the next clip.
It has many contrasts.
It is rough and it is flat.
In places it is cold.
In some it is hot.
Too much rain falls on some areas,
and not enough on others.
But people live on this land.
And, as in Russia,
they are drawn together into towns and cities.
Here is something of the way they live.
It was on seven screens and it was 200 feet across.
And it was at the height of the Cold War.
The Nixon-Khrushchev Kitchen Debate
happened about 50 feet from where this was shown.
And yet, how did it start?
You know, commonality, the first line
in Charles' narration was,
"The same stars that shine down on Russia
shine down on the United States. From the sky,
our cities look much the same."
It was that human connection that Charles and Ray always found in everything.
And you can imagine, and the thing about it is,
that they believed that the human mind could handle this number of images
because the important thing was to get the gestalt
of what the images were about.
But the thing about Charles and Ray
is that they were always modeling stuff.
They were always trying things out.
I think one of the things I am passionate about, my grandparents work,
I'm passionate about my work,
but on top of all that I'm passionate
about a holistic vision of design,
where design is a life skill, not a professional skill.
And you know, those of us with kids often want our kids to take music.
I'm no exception.
But it's not about them becoming Bono or Tracy Chapman.
It's about getting that music thing going through their heads and their thinking.
And this is a model that they did of that seven-screen presentation.
And Charles just checking it out there.
So now we're going to go through that door of furniture.
This is an unusual installation of airport seating.
So what we're going to see is some of the icons of Eames furniture.
was essentially that of a good host,
anticipating the needs of the guest.
So those are cool images. But these are ones I think are really cool.
These are all the prototypes. These are the mistakes,
although I don't think mistakes is the right word in design.
It's just the things you try out
to kind of make it work better.
And you know some of them would probably be terrible chairs.
Some of them are kind of cool looking. It's like "Hey, why didn't they try that?"
It was that hands-on iterative process
which is so much like vernacular design
and folk design in traditional cultures.
and traditional design. I think it may be a real common ground
as we kind of figure out what on earth to do in the next 20 or 30 years.
The other thing that's kind of cool is that
you look at this and in the media when people say design,
they actually mean style.
And I'm really here to talk about design.
But you know the object is just a pivot.
It's a pivot between a process and a system.
about the making of the Eames lounge chair.
The design process for Charles and Ray
never ended in manufacturing.
It continued. They were always trying to make thing better and better.
Because it's like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics.
It's not enough to create one.
You've got to create a system that will work better and better.
So I've always liked this prototype picture.
Because it just kind of, you know, doesn't get any more basic than that.
You try things out.
Its early version had an "X" base. That's what the collectors like.
Charles and Ray liked this one because it was better.
It worked better: "H" base, much more practical.
This is something called a splint.
And I was very touched by Dean Kamen's
work for the military, or for the soldiers,
because Charles and Ray designed a molded plywood splint. This is it.
And they'd been working on furniture before.
But doing these splints they learned a lot about the manufacturing process,
which was incredibly important to them.
because I want you to really get a broth of ideas and images.
This is a house that Charles and Ray designed.
My sister is chasing someone else. It's not me.
Although I endorse heartily the fact that he stole her diary, it's not me.
And then this is a film, on the lower left, that Charles and Ray made.
Now look at that plastic chair.
The house is 1949.
The chair is done in 1949.
they didn't obsess about style for it's own sake.
They didn't say, "Our style is curves. Let's make the house curvy."
They didn't say, "Our style is grids. Let's make the chair griddy."
They focused on the need.
They tried to solve the design problem.
Charles used to say, "The extent to which you have a design style
is the extent to which you have not solved the design problem."
It's kind of a brutal quote.
This is the earlier design of that house.
And again, they managed to figure out a way to make a prototype
of a house -- architecture, very expensive medium.
The "Powers of Ten" is a film they made.
If we watch the next clip,
you're going to see the first version of "Powers of Ten," upper left.
The familiar one on the lower right.
The Eames' film Tops, lower left.
And a lamp that Charles designed for a church.
These form part of a grouping system
much as the stars do.
They are so many and so varied that from this distance
they appear like the stars from Earth.
whole conference is that everybody has been talking about scale.
Everybody here is coming at it from a different way.
I want to give you one example.
E.O. Wilson once told me that when he looked at ants --
he loved them, of course, and he wanted to learn more about them --
he consciously looked at them from the standpoint of scale.
So here is the tiny creature.
And yet simply by changing the frame of reference
it reveals so much, including what ended up being the TED Prize.
And I think part of that is that they never delegated understanding.
And I think in our family we were very lucky,
because we learned about design backwards.
Design was not something other.
It was part of the business of life in general.
It was part of the quality of life.
And here is some family pictures.
And you can see why I'm down on style, with a haircut like that.
But anyway, (Laughter)
I remember the cut grapefruit that we would have at the Eames house when I was a kid.
So we're going to watch another film.
You can see me, I have the same haircut, in the upper right corner.
Upper left is a film they did on toy trains.
Lower right is a solar do-nothing toy.
Lower left is Day-of-the-Dead toys.
Charles used to say that toys are not as innocent as they appear.
They are often the precursor to bigger things.
And these ideas -- that train up there, being about the honest use of materials,
is totally the same
as the honest use of materials in the plywood.
This is a letter that my grandfather sent to my mom when she was five years old.
So can you read it?
Lucia angel,
okay, eye.
Also, what is he doing? Row, rowed.
Sun? No. Well is there another name for a sunrise?
Dawn, very good.
Also rode on one. I ...
in the late, in the mid-1930's,
then you'd know that was a Great Dane.
So, I hope you had a
Citizen Kane, rose --
So, "I saw many trains and also rode on one.
I hope you had a nice time at Buddy's party."
So you guys did pretty good, cool.
So my mom and Charles had this great relationship
where they'd send those sorts of things back and forth to one another.
And it's all part of the, you know,
they used to say, "Take your pleasure seriously."
that's called Kymaerica.
It's sort of an alternative universe.
It's kind of a reinterpretation of the landscape.
Those plaques are plaques we've been installing around North America.
We're about to do six in the U.K. next week.
And they honor events in the linear world from the fictional world.
So, of course, since it's bronze it has to be true.
tumbling through our --
And so we had spelling bees in Paris, Illinois.
because in the Kymaerican story
this is where the Parisian Diaspora started, where there embassy was.
So you can actually visit and have this three-dimensional
fictional experience there.
And the town has really embraced it.
We had the spelling bee in conjunction with the Gwomeus Club.
as inevitable. And it's not.
Other things could have happened. The Japanese could have discovered Monterey.
And we could have been born 100,000 years ago.
And there are a lot of fun things. This is the Museum of the Bench.
They have trading cards
and all sorts of cool things.
And you're kind of trapped in the texture of Kymaerica.
The Tahatchabe, the great road building culture.
A guy named Nobu Naga,
the so-called Japanese Columbus.
But now I'm going to return you to the real world.
which is the first film that Charles ever made.
So let's watch that. Nobody's ever seen it.
Cranbrook is very generous to let us show it for the first time here.
It's a film about Maya Gretel, a famous ceramicist, and a teacher at Cranbrook.
And he made it for the 1939 faculty exhibition.
Silent. We don't have a track for it yet.
Very simple. It's just a start. But it's that learn-by-doing thing.
You want to learn how to make films? Go make a movie.
And you try something out.
See that chair there? The orange one? That's the organic chair. 1940.
At the same time that Charles was doing that chair,
he was doing this film.
So my point is that this scope of vision, this holistic vision
of design, was with them from the beginning.
It wasn't like "Oh, we made some chairs and got successful.
Now we're going to do some movies."
It was always part of how they looked at the world. And that's what's really powerful.
And I think that all of us in this room, as you move design forward,
it's not about just doing one thing.
It's about how you approach problems. And there is this huge, beautiful commonality
between design, business and the world.
So we're going to do the last clip.
And I've shown you some of the images. I just want to focus on sound now.
So this is Charles' voice.
eat very often, particularly in southern India,
they eat off of a banana leaf.
And those a little bit up the scale
eat off of a sort of a low-fired ceramic dish.
And a little bit higher, why they have a glaze
on a thing they call a thali.
If you're up the scale a little bit more,
why, a brass thali.
And then things get to be a little questionable.
There are things like silver-plated thalis.
And there is solid silver thalis.
And I suppose some nut has had a
gold thali that he's eaten off of.
And the guys that have not only means,
but a certain amount of knowledge and understanding,
go to the next step, and they eat off a banana leaf.
And I think that in these times
when we fall back and regroup,
that somehow or other,
the banana leaf parable
sort of got to get working there,
because I'm not prepared to say
that the banana leaf that one eats off of
is the same as the other eats off of.
But it is that process that has happened within the man
that changes the banana leaf.
Because that's part of where we've got to get to.
And I also want to share this one.
"Beyond the age of information is the age of choices."
And I really think that's where we are.
And it's kind of cool for me to be part of a family
and a tradition where he was talking about that in 1978.
And part of why this stuff is important
and all the things that we do are important,
is that these are the ideas we need.
And I think that this is all part of surrendering to the design journey.
That's what we all need to do.
Design is not just for designers anymore. It's a process. It's not style.
All that great thinking needs to really get about solving
pretty key problems.
I really thank you for your time.
(Applause)
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out
to anywhere in the world.
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories
about that transformation.
You probably read something about it in the papers.
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country
there might be voter suppression.
And so a plan came up to video the vote.
And the idea was that individual citizens
with phones capable of taking photos or making video
would document their polling places,
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,
and would upload this to a central place.
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.
What matters here
isn't technical capital,
it's social capital.
These tools don't get socially interesting
until they get technologically boring.
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up
that their uses start permeating society.
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.
Because now that media is increasingly social,
innovation can happen anywhere
that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.
in which innovation is happening everywhere,
and moving from one spot to another.
That is a huge transformation.
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --
the moment our historical generation is living through --
is the largest increase in expressive capability
in human history.
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."
The first one is the famous one, the printing press:
movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations
that made printing possible
and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.
Then, a couple of hundred years ago,
there was innovation in two-way communication,
conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.
Slow, text-based conversations,
then real-time voice based conversations.
Then, about 150 years ago,
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:
first photos, then recorded sound,
then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.
This is what those of us of a certain age
grew up with, and are used to.
The media that is good at creating conversations
is no good at creating groups.
And the media that's good at creating groups
is no good at creating conversations.
If you want to have a conversation
in this world, you have it with one other person.
If you want to address a group, you get the same message
and you give it to everybody in the group,
whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.
That was the media landscape
as we had it in the twentieth century.
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen
is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.
He traces the edges of the individual networks
and then color codes them.
The Internet is the first medium in history
that has native support for groups
and conversation at the same time.
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,
and television, radio, magazines, books,
gave us the one-to-many pattern,
the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.
For the first time,
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.
That's one of the big changes.
is that, as all media gets digitized,
the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage
for all other media,
meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,
magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.
And that means that every medium
is right next door to every other medium.
Put another way,
media is increasingly less just a source of information,
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something
can now gather around and talk to each other as well.
is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,
can now also be producers and not consumers.
Every time a new consumer
joins this media landscape
a new producer joins as well,
because the same equipment --
phones, computers --
let you consume and produce.
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;
it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio
if you pressed the right buttons.
That is a huge change
in the media landscape we're used to.
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.
We've had the Internet in its public form
for almost 20 years now,
and it's still changing
as the media becomes more social.
It's still changing patterns
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.
Last May, China in the Sichuan province
had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,
massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.
They were taking videos of buildings shaking.
They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.
They were Twittering it.
And so as the quake was happening
the news was reported.
And because of the social connections,
Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --
there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.
Twitter announced the existence of the quake
several minutes before the US Geological Survey
had anything up online for anybody to read.
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude
it took them three months to admit that it had happened.
rather than seeing these pictures go up online.
But they weren't given that choice,
because their own citizens beat them to the punch.
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,
rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.
For a while there
the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,
the global short messaging service --
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.
People collating information,
pointing people to news sources,
pointing people to the US geological survey.
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.
And within half a day donation sites were up,
and donations were pouring in from all around the world.
This was an incredible, coordinated global response.
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,
decided that they were going to let it go,
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.
And then this happened.
People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --
the reason so many school buildings collapsed
is that corrupt officials had taken bribes
to allow those building to be built to less than code.
And so they started, the citizen journalists started
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,
in front of these protesters,
in order to get them to go away.
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,
just please stop protesting in public."
because, thanks to the one child policy,
they have lost everyone in their next generation.
Someone who has seen the death of a single child
now has nothing to lose.
And so the protest kept going.
And finally the Chinese cracked down.
That was enough of citizen media.
And so they began to arrest the protesters.
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.
manager of Internet censorship in the world,
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.
And the Great Firewall of China
is a set of observation points
that assume that media is produced by professionals,
it mostly comes in from the outside world,
it comes in relatively sparse chunks,
and it comes in relatively slowly.
And because of those four characteristics
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.
But like the Maginot Line,
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction
for this challenge,
because not one of those four things was true in this environment.
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.
It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,
has quite successfully filtered the web,
is now in the position of having to decide
whether to allow or shut down entire services,
because the transformation to amateur media
is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen
they just, two days ago, announced
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,
because there was no way to filter it other than that.
They had to turn the spigot entirely off.
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.
They also affect people who want to send messages,
not just a particular strategy.
The classic media problem, from the 20th century
is, how does an organization have a message
that they want to get out
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.
And here is the twentieth century answer.
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.
National message. Targeted individuals.
Relatively sparse number of producers.
Very expensive to do,
so there is not a lot of competition.
This is how you reach people.
All of that is over.
social, ubiquitous and cheap.
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages
to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,
are now used to this change.
The audience can talk back.
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.
The really crazy change is here:
it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,
the fact that former consumers are now producers,
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,
and because the size of the network,
the complexity of the network is actually the square
of the number of participants,
meaning that the network, when it grows large,
grows very, very large.
most of the media that was available for public consumption
was produced by professionals.
Those days are over, never to return.
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,
which brings me to my last story.
We saw some of the most imaginative use
of social media during the Obama campaign.
I mean most imaginative use ever.
And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,
the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up
MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com
And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,
and to try and figure out how to help.
An incredible conversation sprung up there.
And then, this time last year,
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill
that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying
on American persons.
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,
He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.
I'm going to vote for this bill."
And many of his own supporters
on his own site went very publicly berserk.
"Please get FISA right."
Within days of this group being created
it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.
Obama had to issue a press release.
He had to issue a reply.
And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.
I understand where you are coming from.
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,
and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."
People in that group realized
that Obama had never shut them down.
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group
or make it harder to join,
to deny its existence, to delete it,
to take to off the site.
They had understood that their role
with myBO.com was to convene their supporters
but not to control their supporters.
that it takes to make really mature use
of this media.
Media, the media landscape that we knew,
as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was
to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast
messages to amateurs,
is increasingly slipping away.
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,
in a world of media where the former audience
are now increasingly full participants,
in that world, media is less and less often
about crafting a single message
to be consumed by individuals.
It is more and more often
a way of creating an environment for convening
and supporting groups.
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard
anywhere in the world,
isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.
That's the media environment we've got.
The question we all face now is,
"How can we make best use of this media?
Even though it means changing the way we've always done it."
Thank you very much.
I'll start with my favorite muse, Emily Dickinson,
who said that wonder is not knowledge, neither is it ignorance.
It's something which is suspended
between what we believe we can be,
and a tradition we may have forgotten.
And I think, when I listen to these incredible people here,
I've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas, so many visions.
And yet, when I look at the environment outside,
you see how resistant architecture is to change.
You see how resistant it is to those very ideas.
We can think them out. We can create incredible things.
And yet, at the end,
it's so hard to change a wall.
We applaud the well-mannered box.
But to create a space that never existed is what interests me;
to create something that has never been,
a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits.
And I think that's really what architecture is based on.
and steel and the elements of the soil.
It's based on wonder.
And that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities,
the greatest spaces that we have had.
And I think that is indeed what architecture is. It is a story.
By the way, it is a story that is told through
its hard materials.
But it is a story of effort and struggle
against improbabilities.
If you think of the great buildings, of the cathedrals, of the temples,
of the pyramids, of pagodas,
of cities in India and beyond,
you think of how incredible this is that that was realized
not by some abstract idea, but by people.
Anything that has been made can be made better.
There it is: the things that I really believe
are of important architecture.
These are the dimensions that I like to work with.
It's something very personal.
It's not, perhaps, the dimensions appreciated by art critics
or architecture critics or city planners.
But I think these are the necessary oxygen
for us to live in buildings, to live in cities,
to connect ourselves in a social space.
It's the only profession where you have to believe in the future.
You can be a general, a politician, an economist who is depressed,
a musician in a minor key, a painter in dark colors.
But architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better.
And it is that belief that I think drives society.
And yet it is in times like this
that I think architecture can thrive with big ideas,
ideas that are not small. Think of the great cities.
Think of the Empire State Building, the Rockefeller Center.
They were built in times that were
not really the best of times in a certain way.
And yet that energy and power of architecture
has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy.
I have never been a fan of the neutral.
I don't like neutrality in life, in anything.
I think expression.
And it's like espresso coffee, you know, you take the essence of the coffee.
That's what expression is.
It's been missing in much of the architecture,
because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered,
the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion,
that has no value.
And yet, I believe it is the expression --
expression of the city, expression of our own space --
that gives meaning to architecture.
Expressive spaces are not spaces
that simply confirm what we already know.
Expressive spaces may disturb us.
And I think that's also part of life.
Life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile,
but to reach out across the abyss of history,
to places we have never been,
and would have perhaps been, had we not been so lucky.
Radical, what does it mean? It's something which is rooted,
and something which is rooted deep in a tradition.
And I think that is what architecture is, it's radical.
It's not just a conservation in formaldehyde
of dead forms.
It is actually a living connection
to the cosmic event that we are part of,
and a story that is certainly ongoing.
It's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending.
It's actually a story in which our acts themselves
are pushing the story in a particular way.
You know the Soviet architecture of that building
is the conservation.
It's like the old Las Vegas used to be.
It's about conserving emotions, conserving the traditions
that have obstructed the mind in moving forward
and of course what is radical is to confront them.
And I think our architecture is a confrontation
with our own senses.
Therefore I believe it should not be cool.
I've always been an opponent of it. I think emotion is needed.
Life without emotion would really not be life.
Even the mind is emotional.
There is no reason which does not take a position
in the ethical sphere, in the philosophical mystery of what we are.
So I think emotion is a dimension
that is important to introduce into city space, into city life.
And I think that is what makes the world a wondrous place.
And of course, the confrontation of the cool, the unemotional with emotion,
is a conversation that I think
cities themselves have fostered.
I think that is the progress of cities.
It's not only the forms of cities,
but the fact that they incarnate emotions,
not just of those who build them,
but of those who live there as well.
But architecture is not the language of words.
It's a language. But it is not a language that can be reduced
to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write.
Too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal
tell you a story, but the story is very short,
which says, "We have no story to tell you."
(Laughter)
is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions,
which might be totally inexplicable in words,
because they operate in proportions,
in materials, in light.
They connect themselves into various sources,
into a kind of complex vector matrix
that isn't really frontal
but is really embedded in the lives,
and in the history of a city, and of a people.
So again, the notion that a building should just be explicit
I think is a false notion,
which has reduced architecture into banality.
Of course, what would we be without computers?
Our whole practice depends on computing.
But the computer should not just be the glove of the hand;
the hand should really be the driver of the computing power.
Because I believe that the hand
in all its primitive, in all its physiological obscurity,
has a source, though the source is unknown,
though we don't have to be mystical about it.
We realize that the hand has been given us
by forces that are beyond our own autonomy.
And I think when I draw drawings
which may imitate the computer, but are not computer drawings --
drawings that can come from sources
that are completely not known, not normal, not seen,
yet the hand -- and that's what I really, to all of you who are working --
how can we make the computer respond to our hand
rather than the hand responding to the computer.
Because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda
that the simple is the good. But I don't believe it.
Listening to all of you, the complexity of thought,
the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming.
And I think we shouldn't shy away in architecture,
You know, brain surgery, atomic theory,
genetics, economics
are complex complex fields.
There is no reason that architecture should shy away
and present this illusory world of the simple.
It is complex. Space is complex.
Space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds.
And as wondrous as it is,
it cannot be reduced to a kind of simplification
that we have often come to be admired.
And yet, our lives are complex.
Our emotions are complex.
Our intellectual desires are complex.
So I do believe that architecture as I see it
needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have,
in every intimacy that we possess.
The political is not an enemy of architecture.
The politeama is the city. It's all of us together.
And I've always believed that the act of architecture,
even a private house, when somebody else will see it, is a political act,
because it will be visible to others.
And we live in a world which is connecting us more and more.
So again, the evasion of that sphere,
which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture,
the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object
has never appealed to me.
And I do believe that this interaction
with the history, with history that is often very difficult,
to grapple with it, to create
a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique.
It's not only the giving of answers.
It's also, just like life, the asking of questions.
Therefore it is important that it be real.
You know we can simulate almost anything.
But the one thing that can be ever simulated
is the human heart, the human soul.
And architecture is so closely intertwined with it
because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere.
So the reality of architecture is visceral. It's not intellectual.
It's not something that comes to us from books and theories.
It's the real that we touch -- the door, the window,
the threshold, the bed --
such prosaic objects. And yet,
I try, in every building, to take that virtual world,
which is so enigmatic and so rich,
and create something in the real world.
Create a space for an office,
a space of sustainability
that really works between that virtuality
and yet can be realized as something real.
What is a habit? It's just a shackle for ourselves.
It's a self-induced poison.
So the unexpected is always unexpected.
You know, it's true, the cathedrals, as unexpected,
will always be unexpected.
You know Frank Gehry's buildings, they will continue to be unexpected in the future.
So not the habitual architecture that instills in us
the false sort of stability,
but an architecture that is full of tension,
an architecture that goes beyond itself
to reach a human soul and a human heart,
and that breaks out of the shackles of habits.
When we see the same kind of architecture
we become immured in that world of those angles,
of those lights, of those materials.
We think the world really looks like our buildings.
And yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders
that have been part of them.
And I often think of the raw and the refined.
What is raw? The raw, I would say
is the naked experience, untouched by luxury,
untouched by expensive materials,
untouched by the kind of refinement
that we associate with high culture.
So the rawness, I think, in space,
the fact that sustainability can actually, in the future
translate into a raw space,
a space that isn't decorated,
a space that is not mannered in any source,
but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature,
might be refractive to our desires.
A space that doesn't always follow us
like a dog that has been trained to follow us,
but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating
other possibilities, other experiences,
that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture.
because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy.
And so I do like something which is pointed, not blunt,
something which is focused on reality,
something that has the power, through its leverage,
to transform even a very small space.
but through its focal point
it can leverage in an Archimedian way
what we think the world is really about.
And often it takes just a building
to change our experience of what could be done, what has been done,
how the world has remained both in between stability and instability.
And of course buildings have their shapes.
Those shapes are difficult to change.
And yet, I do believe that in every social space,
in every public space,
there is a desire to communicate more
than just that blunt thought, that blunt technique,
but something that pinpoints, and can point in various directions
forward, backward, sideways and around.
So that is indeed what is memory.
So I believe that my main interest is to memory.
Without memory we would be amnesiacs.
We would not know which way we were going,
and why we are going where we're going.
rehashing of the same things over and over again,
which, of course, get accolades of critics.
Critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way.
But I rather play something
completely unheard of,
and even with flaws,
than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed
by its meaninglessness.
So again, memory is the city, memory is the world.
Without the memory there would be no story to tell.
There would be nowhere to turn.
And it's not only our memory,
but those who remember us,
which means that architecture is not mute.
It's an art of communication.
It tells a story. The story can reach into obscure desires.
It can reach into sources that are not explicitly available.
It can reach into millennia
that have been buried,
and return them in a just and unexpected equity.
the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me.
Silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city.
Cities should be full of vibrations, full of sound, full of music.
And that indeed is the architectural mission
that I believe is important,
is to create spaces that are vibrant,
that are pluralistic,
that can transform the most prosaic activities,
and raise them to a completely different expectation.
Create a shopping center, a swimming place
that is more like a museum than like entertainment.
And these are our dreams.
You know it costs a lot of money and so on, but yes,
it should not play it safe.
It should not play it safe, because if it plays it safe
it's not moving us in a direction that we want to be.
And I think, of course,
risk is what underlies the world.
World without risk would not be worth living.
So yes, I do believe that the risk we take in every building.
Risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent.
Risks of spaces that have never been
so dizzying,
as they should be, for a pioneering city.
Risks that really move architecture
even with all its flaws, into a space which is much better
that the ever again repeated
hollowness of a ready-made thing.
It's about space. It's not about fashion.
It's not about decoration.
It's about creating with minimal means
something which can not be repeated,
cannot be simulated in any other sphere.
And there of course is the space that we need to breathe,
is the space we need to dream.
These are the spaces that are
not just luxurious spaces for some of us,
but are important for everybody in this world.
It's about carving out a space for trees.
It's carving out a space where nature can enter
the domestic world of a city.
A space where something which has never seen a light of day
can enter into the inner workings of a density.
And I think that is really the nature of architecture.
I don't like beautiful buildings
built for totalitarian regimes.
Where people cannot speak, cannot vote, cannot do anything.
We too often admire those buildings. We think they are beautiful.
And yet when I think of the poverty of society
which doesn't give freedom to its people,
I don't admire those buildings.
So democracy, as difficult as it is, I believe in it.
It's such a complex project.
It's emotional. There is so many interests.
It's political. There is so many parties to this project.
There is so many interests. There's money. There's political power.
There are emotions of the victims.
And yet, in all its messiness, in all its difficulties,
I would not have liked somebody to say,
"This is the tabula rasa, mister architect -- do whatever you want."
I think nothing good will come out of that.
And it is about the dirty word "compromise." Compromise is not bad.
Compromise, if it's artistic,
if it is able to cope with its strategies --
and there is my first sketch and the last rendering --
it's not that far away.
And yet, compromise, consensus,
that is what I believe in.
And Ground Zero, despite all its difficulties, it's moving forward.
It's difficult. 2011, 2013. Freedom Tower, the memorial.
And that is where I end.
on a ship like millions of others,
looking at America from that point of view.
This is America. This is liberty.
This is what we dream about. Its individuality,
demonstrated in the skyline. It's resilience.
And finally, it's the freedom that America represents,
not just to me, as an immigrant, but to everyone in the world. Thank you.
So have you come to peace
with the process that happened at Ground Zero
and the loss of the original, incredible design that you came up with?
of the notion that we are authoritarian,
that we can determine everything that happens.
We have to rely on others, and shape the process in the best way possible.
I came from the Bronx. I was taught not to be a loser,
not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight.
You have to fight for what you believe. You don't always win
everything you want to win. But you can steer the process.
And I believe that what will be built at Ground Zero
will be meaningful, will be inspiring,
will tell other generations of the sacrifices,
of the meaning of this event.
Not just for New York, but for the world.
This is the exact moment
that I started creating something called Tinkering School.
and hammers and other dangerous objects,
and be trusted.
Trusted not to hurt themselves,
and trusted not to hurt others.
Tinkering School doesn't follow a set curriculum,
and there are no tests.
We're not trying to teach anybody any specific thing.
they're confronted with lots of stuff:
wood and nails and rope and wheels,
and lots of tools, real tools.
It's a six-day immersive experience for the kids.
And within that context, we can offer the kids time --
something that seems in short supply
in their over-scheduled lives.
Our goal is to ensure that they leave
with a better sense of how to make things
than when they arrived,
and the deep internal realization
that you can figure things out by fooling around.
(Laughter)
And the kids soon learn
that all projects go awry --
(Laughter)
and become at ease with the idea that every step
in a project is a step closer
to sweet success,
or gleeful calamity.
We start from doodles and sketches.
And sometimes we make real plans.
And sometimes we just start building.
Building is at the heart of the experience:
hands on, deeply immersed
and fully committed to the problem at hand.
Robin and I, acting as collaborators,
keep the landscape of the projects
tilted towards completion.
Success is in the doing,
and failures are celebrated and analyzed.
Problems become puzzles
and obstacles disappear.
setbacks or complexities,
a really interesting behavior emerges: decoration.
(Laughter)
Decoration of the unfinished project
is a kind of conceptual incubation.
From these interludes come deep insights
and amazing new approaches to solving the problems
that had them frustrated just moments before.
Even those mundane, hateful, plastic grocery bags
can become a bridge
stronger than anyone imagined.
And the things that they build
amaze even themselves.
(Applause)
(Applause)
Now, if President Obama
invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics,
then I would have a suggestion for him
that I think would vastly improve
the mathematics education in this country.
And it would be easy to implement
and inexpensive.
is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra.
And everything we learn after that
is building up towards one subject.
And at top of that pyramid, it's calculus.
And I'm here to say
that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit -- that all of our students,
every high school graduate should know --
should be statistics:
probability and statistics.
(Applause)
It's one of the great products of the human mind.
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus.
And every student who studies math, science, engineering, economics,
they should definitely learn calculus
by the end of their freshman year of college.
But I'm here to say, as a professor of mathematics,
that very few people actually use calculus
in a conscious, meaningful way, in their day-to-day lives.
On the other hand,
statistics -- that's a subject that you could,
and should, use on daily basis. Right?
It's risk. It's reward. It's randomness.
It's understanding data.
if all of the American citizens --
knew about probability and statistics,
we wouldn't be in the economic mess that we're in today. (Laughter) (Applause)
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
but if it's taught properly, it can be a lot of fun.
I mean, probability and statistics,
it's the mathematics of games and gambling.
It's analyzing trends. It's predicting the future.
Look, the world has changed
from analog to digital.
And it's time for our mathematics curriculum to change
from analog to digital,
from the more classical, continuous mathematics,
to the more modern, discrete mathematics --
the mathematics of uncertainty,
of randomness, of data --
that being probability and statistics.
learning about the techniques of calculus,
I think it would be far more significant
if all of them knew what two standard deviations
from the mean means. And I mean it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
A month ago today
I stood there:
90 degrees south, the top of
the bottom of the world, the Geographic South Pole.
And I stood there beside two very good friends of mine,
Richard Weber and Kevin Vallely.
Together we had just broken the world speed record
for a trek to the South Pole.
It took us 33 days,
23 hours and 55 minutes to get there.
We shaved five days off the previous best time.
And in the process, I became the first person in history
to make the entire 650-mile journey,
from Hercules Inlet to South Pole,
solely on feet, without skis.
is this tough to do?"
(Laughter)
Imagine, if you will,
dragging a sled, as you just saw in that video clip,
with 170 pounds of gear,
in it everything you need to survive on your Antarctic trek.
It's going to be 40 below, every single day.
You'll be in a massive headwind.
And at some point you're going to have to cross these cracks in the ice,
these crevasses.
Some of them have a very precarious thin footbridge underneath them
that could give way at a moment's notice,
taking your sled, you, into the abyss, never to be seen again.
The punchline to your journey? Look at the horizon.
Yes, it's uphill the entire way,
because the South Pole is at 10,000 feet,
and you're starting at sea level.
where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica.
It began a little less than two years ago.
A couple of buddies of mine and I
had finished a 111-day run across the entire Sahara desert.
And while we were there we learned
the seriousness of the water crisis in Northern Africa.
We also learned that many of the issues facing the people of Northern Africa
affected young people the most.
I came home to my wife after 111 days of running in the sand,
and I said, "You know, there's no doubt if this bozo can get across the desert,
we are capable of doing anything we set our minds to."
But if I'm going to continue doing these adventures, there has to be
a reason for me to do them
beyond just getting there.
Peter Thum, who inspired me with his actions.
He's trying to find and solve water issues, the crisis around the world.
His dedication inspired me to come up with this expedition:
a run to the South Pole
where, with an interactive website,
I will be able to bring young people, students and teachers from around the world
on board the expedition with me,
as active members.
So we would have a live website, that every single day of the 33 days,
we would be blogging, telling stories of,
you know, depleted ozone forcing us to cover our faces,
or we will burn.
Crossing miles and miles of sastrugi --
frozen ice snowdrifts that could be hip-deep.
I'm telling you, crossing these things with 170-pound sled,
that sled may as well have weighed 1,700 pounds,
because that's what it felt like.
to these students that were tracking us as well,
about 10-hour trekking days,
15-hour trekking days,
sometimes 20 hours of trekking daily to meet our goal.
We'd catch cat-naps at 40 below on our sled, incidentally.
In turn, students,
people from around the world, would ask us questions.
Young people would ask the most amazing questions.
where are you going to go and how are you going to do it?
I'm not going to answer that. But I will answer some of the more popular questions.
because the winds on Antarctica were so extreme, it would blow anything else away.
butter and bacon. It's about a million calories.
We were burning about 8,500 a day,
so we needed it.
Virtually none. All of our equipment, including film equipment,
was charged by the sun.
because at some point or another on this expedition,
one of your teammates is going to have to take a very big needle,
and put it in an infected blister, and drain it for you.
because we had a common goal of wanting to inspire these young people.
They were our teammates! They were inspiring us.
The stories we were hearing got us to the South Pole.
The website worked brilliantly as a two-way street of communication.
Young people in northern Canada, kids in an elementary school,
dragging sleds across the school-yard,
pretending they were Richard, Ray and Kevin. Amazing.
45 below that day, I'll never forget it.
We looked at each other with these looks
of disbelief at what we had just completed.
And I remember looking at the guys thinking,
"What do I take from this journey?" You know? Seriously.
That I'm this uber-endurance guy?
I've been running for the grand sum of five years.
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker,
living a very sedentary lifestyle.
What I take from this journey, from my journeys,
is that, in fact,
within every fiber of my belief standing here,
I know that we can make the impossible possible.
I'm learning this at 40.
Can you imagine? Seriously, can you imagine?
I'm learning this at 40 years of age.
Imagine being 13 years old,
hearing those words, and believing it.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to help you re-perceive what philanthropy is,
what it could be,
and what your relationship to it is.
And in doing that, I want to offer you a vision,
an imagined future, if you will,
of how, as the poet Seamus Heaney has put it,
"Once in a lifetime
the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up,
and hope and history rhyme."
We all know which side of these we'd like to be on.
When philanthropy was reinvented a century ago,
when the foundation form was actually invented,
they didn't think of themselves on the wrong side of these either.
In fact they would never have thought of themselves
as closed and set in their ways,
as slow to respond to new challenges,
as small and risk-averse.
And in fact they weren't. They were reinventing charity in those times,
what Rockefeller called "the business of benevolence."
But by the end of the 20th century,
a new generation of critics and reformers
had come to see philanthropy just this way.
as a global philanthropy industry comes about --
and that's exactly what is happening --
is how the aspiration is to flip
these old assumptions,
for philanthropy to become open and big
and fast and connected, in service of the long term.
This entrepreneurial energy
is emerging from many quarters.
And it's driven and propelled forward by new leaders, like many of the people here,
by new tools, like the ones we've seen here,
and by new pressures.
This report is our main public report.
What it tells is the story of how today
actually could be as historic
as 100 years ago.
What I want to do is share some of the coolest things
that are going on with you.
And as I do that, I'm not going to dwell much
on the very large philanthropy that everybody already knows about --
the Gates or the Soros or the Google.
Instead, what I want to do
is talk about the philanthropy of all of us:
the democratization of philanthropy.
This is a moment in history when the average person
has more power than at any time.
each of which challenges an old assumption of philanthropy.
The first is mass collaboration, represented here by Wikipedia.
Now, this may surprise you.
But remember, philanthropy is about giving of time and talent, not just money.
Clay Shirky, that great chronicler of everything networked,
has captured the assumption that this challenges
in such a beautiful way.
He said, "We have lived in this world
where little things are done for love
and big things for money.
Now we have Wikipedia.
Suddenly big things can be done for love."
Author and entrepreneur many of you may know about.
The book is called "Blessed Unrest."
And when it comes out, a series of wiki sites
under the label WISER, are going to launch at the same time.
WISER stands for World Index
for Social and Environmental Responsibility.
WISER sets out to document, link and empower
what Paul calls the largest movement,
and fastest-growing movement in human history:
humanity's collective immune response
to today's threats.
Now, all of these big things for love -- experiments --
aren't going to take off.
But the ones that do
are going to be the biggest, the most open,
the fastest, the most connected form of philanthropy in human history.
This is, of course, to philanthropy
what eBay and Amazon are to commerce.
Think of it as peer-to-peer philanthropy.
And this challenges yet another assumption,
which is that organized philanthropy is only for the very wealthy.
Take a look, if you haven't, at DonorsChoose.
Omidyar Network has made a big investment in DonorsChoose.
It's one of the best known of these new marketplaces
where a donor can go straight into a classroom
and connect with what a teacher says they need.
Take a look at Changing the Present,
started by a TEDster, next time you need a wedding present or a holiday present.
GiveIndia is for a whole country.
And it goes on and on.
which I call aggregated giving.
It's not just that Warren Buffet was so amazingly generous
in that historic act last summer.
It's that he challenged another assumption,
that every giver should have his or her own
fund or foundation.
There are now, today, so many new funds
that are aggregating giving and investing,
bringing together people
around a common goal, to think bigger.
One of the best known is Acumen Fund, led by Jacqueline Novogratz,
a TEDster who got a big boost here at TED.
But there are many others: New Profit in Cambridge,
New School's Venture Fund in Silicon Valley,
Venture Philanthropy Partners in Washington,
Global Fund for Women in San Francisco.
Take a look at these.
These funds are to philanthropy
what venture capital, private equity, and eventually mutual funds
are to investing,
but with a twist --
because often a community forms around these funds,
as it has at Acumen and other places.
these first three types of experiments:
mass collaboration, online marketplaces, aggregated giving.
And understand how they help us re-perceive
what organized philanthropy is.
It's not about foundations necessarily; it's about the rest of us.
And imagine the mash-up, if you will, of these things, in the future,
when these things come together in the experiments of the future --
imagine that somebody puts up, say,
100 million dollars
for an inspiring goal --
there were 21 gifts of 100 million dollars or more in the US last year,
not out of the question --
but only puts it up if it's matched
by millions of small gifts from around the globe,
thereby engaging lots of people,
and building visibility and engaging people
in the goal that's stated.
which are innovation, competitions and social investing.
They're betting a visible competition, a prize,
can attract talent and money to some of the most difficult issues,
and thereby speed the solution.
This tackles yet another assumption,
that the giver and the organization is at the center,
as opposed to putting the problem at the center.
You can look to these innovators
to help us especially with things that require
technological or scientific solution.
which is really, anyway, the biggest of them all,
represented here by Xigi.net.
And this, of course, tackles the biggest assumption of all,
that business is business,
and philanthropy is the vehicle of people who want to create change in the world.
Xigi is a new community site
that's built by the community,
linking and mapping this new social capital market.
It lists already 1,000 entities
that are offering debt and equity for social enterprise.
So we can look to these innovators
to help us remember
that if we can leverage even a small amount of the capital
that seeks a return,
the good that can be driven could be astonishing.
is that we're not thinking our way
into a new way of acting;
we're acting our way into a new way of thinking.
Philanthropy is reorganizing itself
before our very eyes.
And even though all of the experiments and all of the big givers
don't yet fulfill this aspiration,
I think this is the new zeitgeist:
open, big, fast, connected,
and, let us also hope, long.
We have got to realize that it is going to take a long time to do these things.
If we don't develop the stamina to stick with things --
whatever it is you pick, stick with it --
all of this stuff is just going to be, you know, a fad.
And I'm hopeful because it's not only philanthropy
that's reorganizing itself,
it's also whole other portions of the social sector,
and of business,
that are busy challenging "business as usual."
And everywhere I go, including here at TED,
I feel that there is a new moral hunger
that is growing.
What we're seeing is people really wrestling
to describe what is this new thing that's happening.
Words like "philanthrocapitalism,"
and "natural capitalism," and "philanthroentrepreneur,"
and "venture philanthropy."
We don't have a language for it yet.
Whatever we call it,
it's new, it's beginning,
and I think it's gong to quite significant.
which I am going to call the social singularity.
Many of you will realize that I'm ripping a bit off of the science fiction writer
Vernor Vinge's notion of a technological singularity,
where a number of trends accelerate and converge
and come together to create, really, a shockingly new reality.
It may be that the social singularity
ahead is the one that we fear the most:
a convergence of catastrophes,
of environmental degradation,
of weapons of mass destruction, of pandemics,
of poverty.
That's because
our ability to confront the problems that we face
has not kept pace with our ability to create them.
And as we've heard here,
it is no exaggeration to say
that we hold the future of our civilization in our hands
as never before.
Is there a frontier for us
of how we live together?
Our future doesn't have to be imagined.
We can create a future where hope and history rhyme.
But we have a problem.
Our experience to date, both individually and collectively,
hasn't prepared us for what we're going to need to do,
or who we're going to need to be.
We are going to need
a new generation of citizen leaders
willing to commit ourselves to growing and changing and learning
as rapidly as possible.
That's why I have one last thing I want to show you.
of my grandfather and great-grandfather.
This is a newspaper publisher and a banker.
And they were great community leaders.
And, yes, they were great philanthropists.
I keep this photograph close by to me --
it's in my office --
because I've always felt a mystical connection to these two men,
both of whom I never knew.
And so, in their honor,
I want to offer you this blank slide.
And I want you to imagine
that this a photograph of you.
And I want you to think about the community
that you want to be part of creating.
Whatever that means to you.
And I want you to imagine
that it's 100 years from now,
and your grandchild, or great-grandchild,
or niece or nephew or god-child,
is looking at this photograph of you.
What is the story you most want for them to tell?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery
and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.
40 percent of all post-conflict situations,
historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.
Why has the record been so poor?
Well, the conventional approach
to post-conflict situations
has rested on, on kind of, three principles.
So, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.
Try and build a political settlement first.
And then the second step is to say,
"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.
So, short-term peacekeepers.
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?
It's an election.
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government.
I think that approach denies reality.
We see that there is no quick fix.
There's certainly no quick security fix.
I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,
during our post-conflict decade.
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations.
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?
What an election produces is a winner and a loser.
And the loser is unreconciled.
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.
It's not the politics first;
it's actually the politics last.
The politics become easier as the decade progresses
if you're building on a foundation
of security and economic development --
the rebuilding of prosperity.
And why is it so difficult initially?
Because after years of stagnation and decline,
the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.
If the reality is stagnation,
I can only go up if you go down.
And that doesn't produce a productive politics.
And so the mentality has to shift from
zero-sum to positive-sum
before you can get a productive politics.
You can only get positive, that mental shift,
if the reality is that prosperity is being built.
And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.
So that is what you get when you face reality.
But the objective of facing reality
is to change reality.
two complimentary approaches
to changing the reality of the situations.
The first is to recognize the interdependence
of three key actors, who are different actors,
and at the moment are uncoordinated.
The first actor is the Security Council.
The Security Council typically has the responsibility
for providing the peacekeepers
who build the security.
And that needs to be recognized,
first of all, that peacekeeping works.
It is a cost-effective approach.
It does increase security.
But it needs to be done long-term.
It needs to be a decade-long approach,
rather than just a couple of years.
That's one actor, the Security Council.
is the donors.
The donors provide post-conflict aid.
Typically in the past,
the donors have been interested in the first couple of years,
and then they got bored.
They moved on to some other situation.
Post-conflict economic recovery
is a slow process.
There are no quick processes in economics
except decline.
You can do that quite fast.
(Laughter)
So the donors have to stick with this situation
for at least a decade.
is the post-conflict government.
And there are two key things it's got to do.
One is it's got to do economic reform,
not fuss about the political constitution.
It's got to reform economic policy.
Why? Because during conflict
economic policy typically deteriorates.
Governments snatch short-term opportunities
and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.
So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely
bringing people inside the tent.
So those three actors.
And they are interdependent
over a long term.
If the Security Council doesn't commit to security
over the course of a decade,
you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid,
you don't get the economic recovery,
which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.
So we should recognize that interdependence,
by formal, mutual commitments.
The United Nations actually has a language
for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;
it's called the language of compact.
And so we need a post-conflict compact.
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;
it's called the Peace Building Commission.
where, when we got to a post-conflict situation,
there was an expectation of these mutual commitments
from the three parties.
So that's idea one:
recognize interdependence.
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo
of different actors with different priorities.
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs
you get a very unfocused agenda,
because in these situations, needs are everywhere,
but the capacity to implement change is very limited.
So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.
three things are critical.
One is jobs.
One is improvements in basic services --
especially health, which is a disaster during conflict.
So jobs, health, and clean government.
Those are the three critical priorities.
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them.
What is a distinctive approach
to generating jobs in post-conflict situations?
And why are jobs so important?
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.
In post-conflict situations,
the reason that they so often revert to conflict,
is not because elderly women get upset.
It's because young men get upset.
And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.
And so we need a process of generating jobs,
for ordinary young men, fast.
Now, that is difficult.
Governments in post-conflict situation
often respond by puffing up the civil service.
That is not a good idea.
It's not sustainable.
In fact, you're building a long-term liability
by inflating civil service.
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,
because any activity which is open to international trade
is basically going to be uncompetitive
in a post-conflict situation.
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.
and which can generate a lot of jobs,
and which is, in any case, a sensible sector
to expand, post-conflict,
and that is the construction sector.
The construction sector has a vital role,
obviously, in reconstruction.
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict.
During conflict people are doing destruction.
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.
And then when you try and expand it,
because it's shriveled away,
you encounter a lot of bottlenecks.
Basically, prices soar
and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,
but it doesn't generate any jobs.
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks
in expanding the construction sector.
Just think what you have to do
successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.
First you need access to land.
Often the legal system is broken down
so you can't even get access to land.
Secondly you need skills,
the mundane skills of the construction sector.
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,
we need Bricklayers Without Borders,
to rebuild the skill set.
We need firms. The firms have gone away.
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.
If we do that, we not only get the jobs,
we get the improvements in public infrastructure,
the restoration of public infrastructure.
which is improving basic social services.
And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia
in the donor community,
as to how to build basic services
in post-conflict sectors.
On the one hand it pays lip service
to the idea of rebuild an effective state
in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.
Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,
that deliver these services.
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts
donors know that's not a realistic agenda,
and so what they also do is the total bypass:
just fund NGOs.
And so what I'd suggest
is what I call Independent Service Authorities.
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.
The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;
the delivery of services on the ground,
you should use whatever works --
churches, NGOs, local communities,
whatever works.
And in between, there should be a public agency,
the Independent Service Authority,
which channels public money,
and especially donor money,
to the retail providers.
So the NGOs become part of a public government system,
rather than independent of it.
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.
You can use yardstick competition,
so they have to compete against each other
for the resources.
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.
They want to have the discipline and accountability.
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.
And because the government would be funding it,
it would be co-branding these services.
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to
the United States government and some NGO.
They would be co-branded
as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.
So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money
that it needs our money
just to be on a life-support system.
You can't get the basic functions of the state done
unless we put money into the core budget of these countries.
But, if we put money into the core budget,
we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity
that mean that money will be well spent.
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes
it's not just that the money is wasted --
that's the least of the problems --
it's that the money is captured.
It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.
to the budget,
but also provide a lot of scrutiny,
which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.
Paddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia
to the United Nations,
in his book about his experience, he said,
"I realize what I needed
was accountants without borders,
to follow that money."
So that's the -- let me wrap up,
this is the package.
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?
That after 10 years,
the focus on the construction sector
would have produced both jobs
and, hence, security --
because young people would have jobs --
and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.
So that's the focus on the construction sector.
The focus on the basic service delivery
through these independent service authorities
would have rescued basic services
from their catastrophic levels,
and it would have given ordinary people
the sense that the government was doing something useful.
The emphasis on clean government
would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,
because there wouldn't be any money
in taking part in the politics.
And so gradually the selection,
the composition of politicians,
would shift from the crooked to the honest.
Where would that leave us?
Gradually it would shift
from a politics of plunder
to a politics of hope. Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to share with you
some ideas about the secret power of time,
in a very short time.
Keep it quiet please. Settle down.
It's about time. End sequence. Take one.
15 seconds studio.
10, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three, two ...
of the principals in Adam's temptation.
"Come on Adam, don't be so wishy-washy. Take a bite." "I did."
"One bite, Adam. Don't abandon Eve."
"I don't know, guys.
I don't want to get in trouble."
"Okay. One bite. What the hell?"
(Laughter)
yes, no, now, later, impulsive, reflective,
present focus and future focus.
Promised virtues fall prey to the passions of the moment.
thank you George Bush --
the majority, 60 percent, yielded to sexual temptations within one year.
And most of them did so without using birth control.
So much for promises.
They can have one marshmallow now. But if they wait
until the experimenter comes back, they can have two.
Of course it pays, if you like marshmallows, to wait.
What happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation.
They cannot wait. The others, of course, wait.
They resist the temptation. They delay the now for later.
went back 14 years later,
to try to discover what was different about those kids.
There were enormous differences between kids who resisted
and kids who yielded, in many ways.
The kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the SAT.
That's enormous. That's like a whole set of different IQ points.
They didn't get in as much trouble. They were better students.
They were self-confident and determined. And the key for me today,
the key for you,
is, they were future-focused rather than present-focused.
Time perspective is the study of how individuals,
all of us, divide the flow of your human experience
into time zones or time categories.
And you do it automatically and non-consciously.
They vary between cultures, between nations,
between individuals, between social classes,
between education levels.
And the problem is that they can become biased,
because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others.
You make a decision on which you're going to base an action.
For some people it's only about what is in the immediate situation,
what other people are doing and what you're feeling.
And those people, when they make their decisions in that format --
we're going to call them "present-oriented,"
because their focus is what is now.
It's always about "What is this situation like that I've experienced in the past?"
So that their decisions are based on past memories.
And we're going to call those people "past-oriented," because they focus on what was.
it's only about the future.
Their focus is always about anticipated consequences.
Cost-benefit analysis.
We're going to call them "future-oriented." Their focus is on what will be.
the paradox of time perspective,
is something that influences every decision you make,
you're totally unaware of.
Namely, the extent to which you have one of these
biased time perspectives.
Well there is actually six of them. There are two ways to be present-oriented.
There is two ways to be past-oriented, two ways to be future.
You can focus on past-positive, or past-negative.
You can be present-hedonistic,
namely you focus on the joys of life, or present-fatalist --
it doesn't matter, your life is controlled.
You can be future-oriented, setting goals.
Or you can be transcendental future:
namely, life begins after death.
Developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly
depending on the demands of the situation,
that's what you've got to learn to do.
High on past-positive. Moderately high on future.
And moderate on present-hedonism.
And always low on past-negative
and present-fatalism.
So the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past --
past-positive gives you roots. You connect your family, identity and your self.
What you get from the future is wings
to soar to new destinations, new challenges.
What you get from the present hedonism
is the energy, the energy to explore yourself,
places, people, sensuality.
What do futures sacrifice for success?
They sacrifice family time. They sacrifice friend time.
They sacrifice fun time. They sacrifice personal indulgence.
They sacrifice hobbies. And they sacrifice sleep. So it affects their health.
And they live for work, achievement and control.
I'm sure that resonates with some of the TEDsters.
(Laughter)
a Sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present.
I'm here as a future-oriented person
who went over the top, who did all these sacrifices
because teachers intervened, and made me future oriented.
Told me don't eat that marshmallow,
because if you wait you're going to get two of them,
until I learned to balance out.
I've added present-hedonism, I've added a focus on the past-positive,
so, at 76 years old, I am more energetic than ever, more productive,
and I'm happier than I have ever been.
changing the drop-out rates of school kids,
combating addictions, enhancing teen health,
curing vets' PTSD with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures --
promoting sustainability and conservation,
reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate,
altering appeals to suicidal terrorists,
and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes.
many of life's puzzles can be solved
by understanding your time perspective and that of others.
And the idea is so simple, so obvious,
but I think the consequences are really profound.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
A talk about surgical robots
is also a talk about surgery.
And while I've tried to make my images not too graphic,
keep in mind that surgeons have a different relationship with blood
than normal people do,
because, after all, what a surgeon does to a patient,
if it were done without consent,
would be a felony.
Surgeons are the tailors, the plumbers,
the carpenters -- some would say the butchers --
of the medical world:
cutting, reshaping, reforming,
bypassing, fixing.
But you need to talk about surgical instruments
and the evolution of surgical technology together.
of where we are right now
with surgical robots,
and where we're going to be going in the future,
I want to give you a little bit of perspective
of how we got to this point,
how we even came to believe
that surgery was OK,
that this was something that was possible to do,
that this kind of cutting and reforming was OK.
about 10,000 years of perspective.
This is a trephinated skull.
And trephination is simply just cutting a hole in the skull.
And many, many hundreds of skulls like this
have been found in archaeological sites
all over the world,
dating back five to 10 thousand years.
Five to 10 thousand years! Now imagine this.
You are a healer in a Stone Age village.
And you have some guy that you're not quite sure what's wrong with him --
Oliver Sacks is going to be born way in the future.
He's got some seizure disorder. And you don't understand this.
But you think to yourself,
"I'm not quite sure what's wrong with this guy.
But maybe if I cut a hole in his head I can fix it."
(Laughter)
Now that is surgical thinking.
What is astonishing about this is,
even though we don't know really how much of this
was intended to be religious,
or how much of it was intended to be therapeutic,
what we can tell is that these patients lived!
Judging by the healing on the borders of these holes,
they lived days, months, years following trephination.
And so what we are seeing is evidence
of a refined technique
that was being handed down over thousands and thousands of years,
all over the world.
This arose independently at sites everywhere
that had no communication to one another.
We really are seeing the dawn of interventional surgery.
into the Bronze Age and beyond.
And we see new refined tools coming out.
But surgeons in these eras are a little bit more conservative
than their bold, trephinating ancestors.
These guys confined their surgery
to fairly superficial injuries.
And surgeons were tradesmen,
rather than physicians.
This persisted all the way into and through the Renaissance.
but it didn't really save the surgeons terribly much.
They were still a mistrusted lot.
Surgeons still had a bit of a PR problem,
because the landscape was dominated
by the itinerant barber surgeon.
These were folks that traveled from village to village, town to town,
doing surgery sort of as a form of performance art.
Because we were in the age before anesthesia,
the agony of the patient
is really as much of the public spectacle
as the surgery itself.
One of the most famous of these guys, Frere Jacques,
shown here doing a lithotomy --
which is the removal of the bladder stone,
one of the most invasive surgeries they did at the time --
had to take less than two minutes.
You had to have quite a flair for the dramatic,
and be really, really quick.
And he is credited with doing over 4,000 of these public surgeries,
wandering around in Europe,
which is an astonishing number,
when you think that surgery must have been a last resort.
I mean who would put themselves through that?
Until anesthesia, the absence of sensation.
With the demonstration of the Morton Ether Inhaler
at the Mass. General in 1847,
a whole new era of surgery was ushered in.
Anesthesia gave surgeons the freedom to operate.
Anesthesia gave them the freedom to experiment,
to start to delve deeper into the body.
This was truly a revolution in surgery.
After these very long, painstaking operations,
attempting to cure things they'd never been able to touch before,
the patients died.
They died of massive infection.
Surgery didn't hurt anymore,
but it killed you pretty quickly.
And infection would continue to claim a majority of surgical patients
until the next big revolution in surgery,
which was aseptic technique.
or sterility's, biggest advocate,
to a very very skeptical bunch of surgeons.
But eventually they did come around.
The Mayo brothers came out to visit Lister in Europe.
And they came back to their American clinic and they said
they had learned it was as important to wash your hands
before doing surgery
as it was to wash up afterwards. (Laughter)
Something so simple.
And yet, operative mortality dropped profoundly.
With the patient insensitive to pain,
and a sterile operating field
all bets were off, the sky was the limit.
You could now start doing surgery everywhere,
on the gut, on the liver,
on the heart, on the brain.
Transplantation: you could take an organ out of one person,
you could put it in another person, and it would work.
Surgeons didn't have a problem with respectability anymore;
they had become gods.
but at quite a cost,
because they are saving lives,
but not necessarily quality of life,
because healthy people don't usually need surgery,
and unhealthy people have a very hard time recovering from a cut like that.
The question had to be asked,
"Well, can we do these same surgeries
but through little incisions?"
Laparoscopy is doing this kind of surgery:
surgery with long instruments through small incisions.
And it really changed the landscape of surgery.
Some of the tools for this had been around for a hundred years,
but it had only been used as a diagnostic technique
until the 1980s,
when there was changes in camera technologies and things like that,
that allowed this to be done for real operations.
as we're coming down the tube, this is a new entry into the body.
It looks very different from what you're expecting surgery to look like.
We bring instruments in,
from two separate cuts in the side,
and then you can start manipulating tissue.
Within 10 years of the first gallbladder surgeries
being done laparoscopically,
a majority of gallbladder surgeries
were being done laparoscopically --
truly a pretty big revolution.
These techniques were a lot harder to learn
than people had anticipated.
The learning curve was very long.
And during that learning curve the complications went quite a bit higher.
Surgeons had to give up their 3D vision.
They had to give up their wrists.
They had to give up intuitive motion in the instruments.
This surgeon has over 3,000 hours of laparoscopic experience.
Now this is a particularly frustrating placement of the needle.
But this is hard.
And one of the reasons why it is so hard
is because the external ergonomics are terrible.
You've got these long instruments, and you're working off your centerline.
And the instruments are essentially working backwards.
and put it on the other side of that small incision,
is you need to put a wrist on that instrument.
And so -- I get to talk about robots --
the da Vinci robot
put just that wrist on the other side of that incision.
And so here you're seeing the operation of this wrist.
And now, in contrast to the laparoscopy,
you can precisely place the needle in your instruments,
and you can pass it all the way through
and follow it in a trajectory.
And the reason why this becomes so much easier
is -- you can see on the bottom --
the hands are making the motions,
and the instruments are following those motions exactly.
Now, what you put between those instruments and those hands,
is a large, fairly complicated robot.
The surgeon is sitting at a console,
and controlling the robot with these controllers.
And the robot is moving these instruments around,
and powering them, down inside the body.
You have a 3D camera, so you get a 3D view.
a lot of these robots have been out
and being used for surgical procedures like a prostatectomy,
which is a prostate deep in the pelvis,
and it requires fine dissection
and delicate manipulation
to be able to get a good surgical outcome.
You can also sew bypass vessels directly onto a beating heart
without cracking the chest.
This is all done in between the ribs.
And you can go inside the heart itself
and repair the valves from the inside.
You've got these technologies -- thank you --
(Applause)
And so you might say, "Wow this is really cool!
So, smartypants, why isn't all surgery being done this way?"
And there are some reasons, some good reasons.
And cost is one of them.
With all its bells and whistles, one of those robots
will cost you about as much as a solid gold surgeon.
More useful than a solid gold surgeon,
but, still, it's a fairly big capital investment.
But once you've got it, your procedure costs do come down.
But there are other barriers.
So something like a prostatectomy --
the prostate is small, and it's in one spot,
and you can set your robot up very precisely
to work in that one spot.
And so it's perfect for something like that.
And in fact if you, or anyone you know,
had their prostate taken out in the last couple of years,
chances are it was done with one of these systems.
But if you need to reach more places than just one,
you need to move the robot.
And you need to put some new incisions in there.
And you need to re-set it up.
And then you need to add some more ports, and more.
And the problem is it gets time-consuming, and cumbersome.
that just aren't being done with the da Vinci.
So we had to ask the question, "Well how do we fix that?"
What if we could change it so that we didn't have to re-set up
each time we wanted to move somewhere different?
What if we could bring all the instruments
in together in one place?
How would that change the capabilities of the surgeon?
And how would that change the experience for the patient?
Now, to do that,
we need to be able to bring a camera
and instruments in together through one small tube,
like that tube you saw in the laparoscopy video.
Or, not so coincidentally, like a tube like this.
is the debut of this new technology,
this new robot that is going to be able to reach anywhere.
Ready? So here it comes.
This is the camera, and three instruments.
And as you see it come out,
in order to actually be able to do anything useful,
it can't all stay clustered up like this.
It has to be able to come off of the centerline
and then be able to work back toward that centerline.
He's a cheeky little devil.
But what this lets you do
is gives you that all-important traction,
and counter-traction,
so that you can dissect, so that you can sew,
so that you can do all the things that you need to do,
all the surgical tasks.
But it's all coming in through one incision.
It's not so simple.
But it's worth it for the freedom that this gives us
as we're going around.
For the patient, however,
it's transparent. This is all they're going to see.
We get to write the script of the next revolution in surgery.
As we take these capabilities, and we get to go to the next places,
we get to decide what our new surgeries are going to be.
And I think to really get the rest of the way
in that revolution,
we need to not just take our hands in in new ways,
we also need to take our eyes in in new ways.
We need to see beyond the surface.
We need to be able to guide what we're cutting
in a much better way.
One of the problems with this,
even for surgeons who've been looking at this a lot,
is you can't see the cancer,
especially when it's hidden below the surface.
And so what we're starting to do
is we're starting to inject specially designed markers
into the bloodstream that will target the cancer.
It will go, bind to the cancer.
And we can make those markers glow.
And we can take special cameras,
and we can look at it.
Now we know where we need to cut,
even when it's below the surface.
We can take these markers and we can inject them in a tumor site.
And we can follow where they flow out from that tumor site,
so we can see the first places where that cancer might travel.
We can inject these dyes into the bloodstream,
so that when we do a new vessel
and we bypass a blockage on the heart,
we can see if we actually made the connection,
before we close that patient back up again --
something that we haven't been able to do
without radiation before.
We can light up tumors
like this kidney tumor,
so that you can exactly see where the boundary is
between the kidney tumor and the kidney you want to leave behind,
or the liver tumor and the liver you want to leave behind.
to this macro vision.
We have flexible microscopic probes
that we can bring down into the body.
And we can look at cells directly.
I'm looking at nerves here. So these are nerves you see, down on the bottom,
and the microscope probe that's being held by the robotic hand, up at the top.
So this is all very prototypey at this point.
Because they let you keep continence,
bladder control, and sexual function after surgery,
all of which is generally fairly important to the patient.
we can reach it all, and we can see it all.
We can heal the disease.
And we can leave the patient whole and intact
and functional afterwards.
Now, I've talked about the patient
as if the patient is, somehow, someone abstract
outside this room.
Many of you, all of you maybe,
will at some point, or have already, faced a diagnosis of cancer,
or heart disease, or some organ dysfunction
that's going to buy you a date with a surgeon.
And when you get to that point --
I mean, these maladies don't care
how many books you've written,
how many companies you've started,
that Nobel Prize you have yet to win,
how much time you planned to spend with your children.
These maladies come for us all.
is that going to make that diagnosis any less terrifying?
I'm not sure I really even want it to.
Because facing your own mortality
causes a re-evaluation of priorities,
and a realignment of what your goals are in life, unlike anything else.
And I would never want to deprive you of that epiphany.
What I want instead,
is for you to be whole, intact,
and functional enough to go out and save the world,
after you've decided you need to do it.
And that is my vision for your future.
Thank you.
(Applause)
My journey to coming here today
started in 1974.
That's me with the funny gloves.
I was 17 and going on a peace walk.
What I didn't know though, was most of those people, standing there
with me, were Moonies.
(Laughter)
And within a week
I had come to believe
that the second coming of Christ had occurred,
that it was Sun Myung Moon,
and that I had been specially chosen and prepared by God
to be his disciple.
my family was not that thrilled with this.
(Laughter)
And they tried everything they could to get me out of there.
There was an underground railroad of sorts
that was going on during those years. Maybe some of you remember it.
They were called deprogrammers.
And after about five long years
my family had me deprogrammed.
And I then became a deprogrammer.
I started going out on cases.
And after about five years of doing this,
I was arrested for kidnapping.
Most of the cases I went out on
were called involuntary.
What happened was that the family
had to get their loved ones some safe place somehow.
And so they took them to some safe place.
And we would come in and talk to them, usually for about a week.
And so after this happened,
I decided it was a good time to turn my back on this work.
There was a burning question though that would not leave me.
And that was, "How did this happen to me?"
And in fact, what did happen to my brain?
Because something did.
And so I decided to write a book, a memoir,
about this decade of my life.
there was a documentary that came out.
It was on Jonestown.
And it had a chilling effect on me.
These are the dead in Jonestown.
About 900 people died that day,
most of them taking their own lives.
Women gave poison to their babies,
and watched foam come from their mouths as they died.
that have been blessed by their messiah.
Their mates were chosen for them.
The bottom picture is Hitler youth.
This is the leg of a suicide bomber.
The thing I had to admit to myself,
with great repulsion,
was that I get it.
I understand how this could happen.
I understand how someone's brain,
how someone's mind can come to the place
where it makes sense --
in fact it would be wrong, when your brain is working like that --
not to try to save the world through genocide.
And how I've come to view what happened to me
is a viral, memetic infection.
For those of you who aren't familiar with memetics,
a meme has been defined as
an idea that replicates in the human brain
and moves from brain to brain like a virus,
much like a virus. The way a virus works is --
it can infect and do the most damage to someone
who has a compromised immune system.
and I was pretty lost in my world.
I was really idealistic.
These easy ideas to complex questions are very appealing
when you are emotionally vulnerable.
What happens is that
circular logic takes over.
"Moon is one with God.
God is going to fix all the problems in the world.
All I have to do is humbly follow.
Because God is going to stop war and hunger --
all these things I wanted to do --
all I have to do is humbly follow.
Because after all, God is [working through] the messiah. He's going to fix all this."
It becomes impenetrable.
And the most dangerous part of this
is that is creates "us" and "them,"
"right" and "wrong,"
"good" and "evil."
And it makes anything possible,
makes anything rationalizable.
if you looked at my brain
during those years in the Moonies --
neuroscience is expanding exponentially,
as Ray Kurzweil said yesterday. Science is expanding.
We're beginning to look inside the brain.
And so if you looked at my brain, or any brain that's infected with
a viral memetic infection like this,
and compared it to anyone in this room,
or anyone who uses critical thinking on a regular basis,
I am convinced it would look very, very different.
gives me hope.
And the reason that gives me hope
is that the first thing is to admit
that we have a problem.
But it's a human problem. It's a scientific problem, if you will.
It happens in the human brain. There is no evil force out there to get us.
And so this is something that, through research and education,
I believe that we can solve.
And so the first step is to realize
that we can do this together,
and that there is no "us" and "them."
Thank you very much. (Applause)
Why do so many people reach success and then fail?
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.
So we do everything that leads up to success,
but then we get there. We figure we've made it,
we sit back in our comfort zone,
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.
And I can tell you this happens,
because it happened to me.
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.
I can just sit back and relax."
But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.
I don't need to improve any more."
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy
and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.
And the only thing that came was creative block.
I couldn't come up with any ideas.
and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.
And I got distracted by it.
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,
when I should have been talking to my clients.
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,
like management. I am the world's worst manager,
but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,
the president of the company.
and here I was, outwardly very successful,
but inwardly very depressed.
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.
I bought a fast car.
(Laughter)
It didn't help.
I was faster but just as depressed.
I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.
But money can't buy happiness."
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."
And he put me on anti-depressants.
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,
because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Because they could see I was no longer serving them,
I was only serving myself.
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.
And that was great.
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,
did all the things that took me back up to success.
But it wasn't a quick trip.
It took seven years.
And when I went back to following these eight principles,
the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.
And I woke up one day and I said,
"I don't need Prozac anymore."
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.
It's a continuous journey.
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"
we just keep following these eight principles,
because that is not only how we achieve success,
it's how we sustain it.
So here is to your continued success.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Let me share with you today an original discovery.
But I want to tell it to you the way it really happened --
not the way I present it in a scientific meeting,
or the way you'd read it in a scientific paper.
It's a story about beyond biomimetics,
to something I'm calling biomutualism.
I define that as an association between biology and another discipline,
where each discipline reciprocally advances the other,
but where the collective discoveries that emerge are beyond any single field.
Now, in terms of biomimetics,
as human technologies take on more of the characteristics of nature,
nature becomes a much more useful teacher.
Engineering can be inspired by biology
by using its principles and analogies when they're advantageous,
but then integrating that with the best human engineering,
ultimately to make something actually better than nature.
These are gecko toes.
And we wondered how they use these bizarre toes
to climb up a wall so quickly.
We discovered it. And what we found was
that they have leaf-like structures on their toes,
with millions of tiny hairs that look like a rug,
and each of those hairs has the worst case of split-ends possible:
about 100 to 1000 split ends that are nano-size.
And the individual has 2 billion of these nano-size split ends.
They don't stick by Velcro or suction or glue.
They actually stick by intermolecular forces alone,
van der Waals forces.
And I'm really pleased to report to you today
that the first synthetic self-cleaning, dry adhesive has been made.
From the simplest version in nature, one branch,
my engineering collaborator, Ron Fearing, at Berkeley,
had made the first synthetic version.
And so has my other incredible collaborator,
Mark Cutkosky, at Stanford --
he made much larger hairs than the gecko,
but used the same general principles.
(Laughter)
That's Kellar Autumn, my former Ph.D. student,
professor now at Lewis and Clark,
literally giving his first-born child up for this test.
(Laughter)
who appeared to be brimming with confidence.
Lynn began her 60-foot ascent.
Lynn made it to the top in a perfect pairing
of Hollywood and science.
But she actually used these on smooth surfaces --
two of them -- to climb up, and pull herself up.
And you can try this in the lobby,
and look at the gecko-inspired material.
Now the problem with the robots doing this
is that they can't get unstuck,
with the material.
This is the gecko's solution. They actually peel their toes away
from the surface, at high rates,
as they run up the wall.
the newest version of a robot, Stickybot,
using a new hierarchical dry adhesive.
Here is the actual robot.
And here is what it does.
And if you look,
you can see that it uses
the toe peeling,
just like the gecko does.
If we can show some of the video, you can see it climbing up the wall.
(Applause)
There it is.
And now it can go on other surfaces because of the new adhesive
that the Stanford group was able to do
in designing this incredible robot.
(Applause)
You see something on it. It's not just to look like a gecko.
It has a tail. And just when you think you've figured out nature,
this kind of thing happens.
The engineers told us, for the climbing robots,
that, if they don't have a tail,
they fall off the wall.
So what they did was they asked us
an important question.
They said, "Well, it kind of looks like a tail."
Even though we put a passive bar there.
"Do animals use their tails when they climb up walls?"
What they were doing was returning the favor,
by giving us a hypothesis to test,
in biology, that we wouldn't have thought of.
being the biologists, and we should know this already.
We said, "Well, what do tails do?"
Well we know that tails store fat, for example.
We know that you can grab onto things with them.
And perhaps it is most well known
that they provide static balance.
(Laughter)
It can also act as a counterbalance.
So watch this kangaroo.
See that tail? That's incredible!
Marc Raibert built a Uniroo hopping robot.
And it was unstable without its tail.
Now mostly tails limit maneuverability,
like this human inside this dinosaur suit.
(Laughter)
My colleagues actually went on to test this limitation,
by increasing the moment of inertia of a student, so they had a tail,
and running them through and obstacle course,
and found a decrement in performance,
like you'd predict.
(Laughter)
But of course, this is a passive tail.
And you can also have active tails.
that one of the great TED moments in the past,
from Nathan,
we've talked about an active tail.
were interested in love, not war.
It can also be used in defense.
Pretty powerful.
So we then went back and looked at the animal.
And we ran it up a surface.
But this time what we did is we put a slippery patch
that you see in yellow there.
And watch on the right what the animal is doing with its tail
when it slips. This is slowed down 10 times.
So here is normal speed.
And watch it now slip,
and see what it does with its tail.
It has an active tail that functions as a fifth leg,
and it contributes to stability.
If you make it slip a huge amount, this is what we discovered.
This is incredible.
The engineers had a really good idea.
okay, they have an active tail, but let's picture them.
They're climbing up a wall, or a tree.
And they get to the top and let's say there's some leaves there.
And what would happen if they climbed on the underside of that leaf,
and there was some wind, or we shook it?
And we did that experiment, that you see here.
(Applause)
And this is what we discovered.
Now that's real time. You can't see anything.
But there it is slowed down.
For those of you who remember your physics, that's a zero-angular-momentum
righting response. But it's like a cat.
You know, cats falling. Cats do this. They twist their bodies.
But geckos do it better.
And they do it with their tail.
So they do it with this active tail as they swing around.
And then they always land in the sort of superman skydiving posture.
Okay, now we wondered, if we were right,
we should be able to test this in a physical model, in a robot.
over there, a prototype, with the tail.
And we're going to attempt the first air-righting response
in a tail, with a robot.
If we could have the lights on it.
Okay, there it goes.
And show the video.
There it is.
And it works just like it does in the animal.
So all you need is a swing of the tail to right yourself.
(Applause)
because the animal has no gliding adaptations,
so we thought, "Oh that's okay. We'll put it in a vertical wind tunnel.
We'll blow the air up, we'll give it a landing target, a tree trunk,
just outside the plexi-glass enclosure, and see what it does.
(Laughter)
So we did. And here is what it does.
So the wind is coming from the bottom. This is slowed down 10 times.
It does an equilibrium glide. Highly controlled.
This is sort of incredible. But actually it's quite beautiful,
when you take a picture of it.
And it's better than that, it -- just in the slide -- maneuvers in mid-air.
And the way it does it, is it takes its tail
and it swings it one way to yaw left, and it swings its other way to yaw right.
So we can maneuver this way.
And then -- we had to film this several times to believe this --
it also does this. Watch this.
It oscillates its tail up and down like a dolphin.
It can actually swim through the air.
But watch its front legs. Can you see what they are doing?
What does that mean for the origin of flapping flight?
Maybe it's evolved from coming down from trees,
and trying to control a glide.
Stay tuned for that.
(Laughter)
So there is the landing target. Could they steer towards it
with these capabilities? Here it is in the wind tunnel.
And it certainly looks like it.
You can see it even better from down on top.
Watch the animal.
Definitely moving towards the landing target.
Watch the whip of its tail as it does it. Look at that.
It's unbelievable.
because there are no reports of it gliding.
So we went, "Oh my god, we have to go to the field,
and see if it actually does this."
Completely opposite of the way you'd see it on a nature film, of course.
We wondered, "Do they actually glide in nature?"
Well we went to the forests of Singapore and Southeast Asia.
And the next video you see is the first time we've showed this.
of animal gliding down. There is a red trajectory line.
Look at the end to see the animal.
But then as it gets closer to the tree,
look at the close-up. And see if you can see it land.
So there it comes down. There is a gecko at the end of that trajectory line.
You see it there? There? Watch it come down.
Now watch up there and you can see the landing. Did you see it hit?
It actually uses its tail too,
just like we saw in the lab.
by suggesting that they can make an active tail.
And here is the first active tail, in the robot,
made by Boston Dynamics.
So to conclude, I think we need to build biomutualisms, like I showed,
that will increase the pace of basic discovery in their application.
To do this though, we need to redesign education in a major way,
to balance depth with interdisciplinary communication,
and explicitly train people how to contribute to, and benefit from other disciplines.
And of course you need the organisms and the environment to do it.
That is, whether you care about security, search and rescue or health,
we must preserve nature's designs,
otherwise these secrets will be lost forever.
And from what I heard from our new president,
I'm very optimistic. Thank you.
(Applause)
I used to be a Malthusian.
This was my mental model of the world:
exploding population, small planet;
it's going to lead to ugly things.
But I'm moving past Malthus,
because I think that we just might be about 150 years
from a kind of new enlightenment.
This is the U.N.'s population data,
you may have seen, for the world.
And the world's population expected to top out
at something hopefully a bit less than 10 billion, late this century.
And after that, most likely it's going to begin to decline.
So what then?
Most of the economic models are built around scarcity and growth.
So a lot of economists
look at declining population
and expect to see stagnation, maybe depression.
But a declining population is going to have
at least two very beneficial economic effects.
make investing in property a bad bet.
In the cities, a lot of the cost of property
is actually wrapped up in its speculative value.
Take away land speculation,
price of land drops.
And that begins to lift a heavy burden
off the world's poor.
means scarce labor.
Scarce labor drives wages.
As wages increase
that also lifts the burden on the poor and the working class.
Now I'm not talking about a radical drop in population like we saw in the Black Death.
But look what happened in Europe
after the plague:
rising wages,
land reform,
technological innovation,
birth of the middle class;
and after that, forward-looking social movements
like the Renaissance,
and later the Enlightenment.
romanticizing the past.
All of the Western religions begin with the notion of Eden,
and descend through a kind of profligate present
to a very ugly future.
So human history is viewed
as sort of this downhill slide
from the good old days.
about two generations after the top of that curve,
once the effects of a declining population
start to settle in.
At that point, we'll start romanticizing the future again,
instead of the nasty, brutish past.
Why talk about social-economic movements
that may be more than a century away?
Because transitions are dangerous times.
When land owners start to lose money,
and labor demands more pay,
there are some powerful interests that are going to fear for the future.
Fear for the future leads to some rash decisions.
If we have a positive view about the future
then we may be able to accelerate through that turn,
instead of careening off a cliff.
I think that your great great grandchildren
will forget all about Malthus.
And instead, they'll be planning for the future
and starting to build the 22nd Century Enlightenment.
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is a world-changing invention.
The smoke alarm has saved perhaps hundreds of thousands
of lives, worldwide.
But smoke alarms don't prevent fires.
with 350,000 home fires.
And one of the main causes of all these fires is electricity.
What if we could prevent electrical fires
before they start?
Well, a couple of friends and I figured out how to do this.
Well it turns out that the main causes
are faulty and misused appliances and electrical wiring.
Our invention had to address all of these issues.
So what about circuit breakers?
Well, Thomas Edison invented the circuit breaker in 1879.
This is 130-year-old technology,
and this is a problem, because over 80 percent
of all home electrical fires
start below the safety threshold of circuit breakers.
Hmmm ...
that electrical appliances
must be able to communicate directly
with the power receptacle itself.
Any electrical device -- an appliance, an extension cord, whatever --
must be able to tell the power outlet,
"Hey, power outlet,
I'm drawing too much current. Shut me off now, before I start a fire."
And the power outlet needs to be smart enough to do it.
So here is what we did. We put a 10-cent digital transponder,
a data tag, in the appliance plug.
And we put an inexpensive, wireless data reader inside the receptacle
so they could communicate.
Now, every home electrical system
becomes an intelligent network.
The appliance's safe operating parameters
are embedded into its plug.
If too much current is flowing,
the intelligent receptacle turns itself off,
and prevents another fire from starting.
We call this technology EFCI,
Electrical Fault Circuit Interrupter.
roughly 2,500 children
are admitted to emergency rooms for shock and burn injuries
related to electrical receptacles. And this is crazy.
An intelligent receptacle prevents injuries
because the power is always off,
until an intelligent plug is detected. Simple.
perhaps the greatest benefit of intelligent power
is in its energy savings.
This invention will reduce global energy consumption
by allowing remote control and automation
of every outlet in every home and business.
Now you can choose to reduce your home energy bill
by automatically cycling heavy loads
like air conditioners and heaters.
Hotels and businesses can shut down unused rooms
from a central location, or even a cell phone.
There are 10 billion electrical outlets
in North America alone.
The potential energy savings is very, very significant.
Of those, 186 have been granted:
228 are in process.
And I'm pleased to announce that just three weeks ago
we received our first international recognition,
the 2009 CES Innovation Award.
So, to conclude,
intelligent power can, globally, save thousands of lives,
prevent tens of thousands of injuries,
and eliminate tens of billions of dollars in property damage
every single year,
while significantly reducing global energy consumption.
In the spirit of this year's TED Conference,
we think this is a powerful, world-changing invention.
And I'd like to thank Chris for this opportunity
to unveil our technology with you, and soon the world.
Thank you.
(Applause)
What's happening to the climate?
It is unbelievably bad.
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,
which is likely to be gone at this point
in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,
52 percent are tied to buildings.
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.
So we ran off to a sushi bar.
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.
And it was something called EcoRock.
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old
gypsum drywall process that generates
20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,
which is exactly what we've done.
Decided to use recycled content from cement
and steel manufacturing.
There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.
But our people had to do some 5,000
different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,
not made using gypsum at all.
That's the finished production line there.
We got our first panel out on December third.
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.
And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,
leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year
for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.
Thank you. Thank you.
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas
equivalent to build one house.
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.
Look around the room: chairs, wood,
everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.
And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.
We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.
We're going as fast as we can.
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,
you know, CO2 generated. Right?
So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.
When they have their kids, 2050,
they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,
"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could
with the team that you had."
So my hope is that when you leave TED,
you will look at reducing your carbon footprint
in however you can do it.
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
This is my first trip,
my first foreign trip as a first lady.
Can you believe that?
(Applause)
And while this is not my first visit to the U.K.,
I have to say that I am glad that this is my first official visit.
The special relationship between the United States and the U.K.
is based not only on the relationship between governments,
but the common language and the values that we share,
and I'm reminded of that by watching you all today.
During my visit I've been especially honored
to meet some of Britain's most extraordinary women --
women who are paving the way for all of you.
the future leaders of Great Britain and this world.
And although the circumstances of our lives may seem very distant,
with me standing here as the First Lady of the United States of America,
and you, just getting through school,
I want you to know that we have very much in common.
For nothing in my life's path
would have predicted that I'd be standing here
as the first African-American First Lady
of the United States of America.
There is nothing in my story that would land me here.
I wasn't raised with wealth or resources
or any social standing to speak of.
I was raised on the South Side of Chicago.
That's the real part of Chicago.
And I was the product of a working-class community.
My father was a city worker all of his life,
and my mother was a stay-at-home mom.
And she stayed at home to take care of me and my older brother.
Neither of them attended university.
My dad was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis
in the prime of his life.
But even as it got harder for him to walk
and get dressed in the morning --
I saw him struggle more and more --
my father never complained about his struggle.
He was grateful for what he had.
He just woke up a little earlier and worked a little harder.
And my brother and I were raised with all that you really need:
love, strong values
and a belief that with a good education
and a whole lot of hard work,
that there was nothing that we could not do.
when girls from the very beginning of their lives
are loved and nurtured by the people around them.
I was surrounded by extraordinary women in my life:
grandmothers, teachers, aunts, cousins, neighbors,
who taught me about quiet strength and dignity.
And my mother, the most important role model in my life,
who lives with us at the White House
and helps to care for our two little daughters,
Malia and Sasha.
She's an active presence in their lives, as well as mine,
and is instilling in them
the same values that she taught me and my brother:
things like compassion, and integrity,
and confidence, and perseverance --
all of that wrapped up in an unconditional love
that only a grandmother can give.
by some strong male role models as well,
including my father, my brother, uncles and grandfathers.
The men in my life taught me some important things, as well.
They taught me about what a respectful relationship
should look like between men and women.
They taught me about what a strong marriage feels like:
that it's built on faith and commitment
and an admiration for each other's unique gifts.
They taught me about what it means
to be a father
and to raise a family.
And not only to invest in your own home
but to reach out and help raise kids
in the broader community.
that I looked for in my own husband,
Barack Obama.
And when we first met,
one of the things that I remember is that he took me out on a date.
And his date was to go with him to a community meeting.
(Laughter)
I know, how romantic.
(Laughter)
But when we met, Barack was a community organizer.
He worked, helping people to find jobs
and to try to bring resources into struggling neighborhoods.
As he talked to the residents in that community center,
he talked about two concepts.
He talked about "the world as it is" and "the world as it should be."
And I talked about this throughout the entire campaign.
What he said, that all too often,
is that we accept the distance between those two ideas.
And sometimes we settle for the world as it is,
even when it doesn't reflect our values and aspirations.
But Barack reminded us on that day,
all of us in that room, that we all know
what our world should look like.
We know what fairness and justice and opportunity look like.
We all know.
And he urged the people in that meeting,
in that community,
to devote themselves to closing the gap
between those two ideas,
to work together to try to make the world as it is
and the world as it should be, one and the same.
reminded and convinced that all of you in this school
are very important parts of closing that gap.
You are the women who will build the world as it should be.
You're going to write the next chapter in history.
Not just for yourselves, but for your generation
and generations to come.
And that's why getting a good education
is so important.
That's why all of this that you're going through --
the ups and the downs, the teachers that you love and the teachers that you don't --
why it's so important.
Because communities and countries and ultimately the world
are only as strong as the health of their women.
And that's important to keep in mind.
The difference between a struggling family and a healthy one
is often the presence of an empowered woman
or women at the center of that family.
The difference between a broken community and a thriving one
is often the healthy respect between men and women
who appreciate the contributions each other makes to society.
The difference between a languishing nation
and one that will flourish
is the recognition that we need equal access to education
for both boys and girls.
and the surrounding buildings named for Mexican artist Frida Kahlo,
Mary Seacole,
the Jamaican nurse known as the "black Florence Nightingale,"
and the English author, Emily Bronte,
honor women who fought sexism, racism and ignorance,
to pursue their passions to feed their own souls.
They allowed for no obstacles.
As the sign said back there, "without limitations."
They knew no other way to live
than to follow their dreams.
And having done so, these women
moved many obstacles.
And they opened many new doors
for millions of female doctors and nurses
and artists and authors,
all of whom have followed them.
And by getting a good education,
you too can control your own destiny.
If you want to know the reason why I'm standing here,
it's because of education.
I never cut class. Sorry, I don't know if anybody is cutting class.
I never did it.
I loved getting As.
I liked being smart.
I liked being on time. I liked getting my work done.
I thought being smart was cooler than anything in the world.
And you too, with these same values,
can control your own destiny.
You too can pave the way.
You too can realize your dreams,
and then your job is to reach back
and to help someone just like you do the same thing.
History proves that it doesn't matter
whether you come from a council estate
or a country estate.
by your own fortitude,
your own confidence, your own individual hard work.
That is true. That is the reality of the world that we live in.
You now have control over your own destiny.
And it won't be easy -- that's for sure.
But you have everything you need.
Everything you need to succeed,
you already have, right here.
They call it the Oval Office.
In the White House, there's the desk that he sits at --
it's called the Resolute desk.
It was built by the timber of Her Majesty's Ship Resolute
and given by Queen Victoria.
It's an enduring symbol of the friendship between our two nations.
And its name, Resolute,
is a reminder of the strength of character that's required
not only to lead a country,
but to live a life of purpose, as well.
And I hope in pursuing your dreams, you all remain resolute,
that you go forward without limits,
and that you use your talents -- because there are many; we've seen them;
it's there --
that you use them to create the world as it should be.
Because we are counting on you.
We are counting on every single one of you
to be the very best that you can be.
Because the world is big.
And it's full of challenges.
And we need strong, smart, confident young women
to stand up and take the reins.
"The Better Man."
with the tattooed bum?
Every one of us had a mother,
only one --
probably the most important person in your life,
if you're lucky enough to know them.
My mother was certainly the most important in mine.
Let me try and describe her to you.
She's 86 years old. She's frail.
White, platinum hair.
Why do they do that? Why do old ladies go to those hair shops,
and make those helmets?
(Laughter)
Bright as a button. All the ducks in a row.
Looks like a much prettier version
of Margaret Thatcher,
(Laughter)
but without any of the soft bits in Margaret's character.
(Laughter)
I wrote this poem for her. These are not my beliefs.
But my mother has lived by this creed
all her life.
If every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon
were tied end to end along a railroad track,
that would be me,
stoking the train
without a qualm in the world.
Ladies, don't do it.
Don't do it.
You think we want you to do it, but we don't want you to do it.
Stop it.
Tell them to go to hell.
You bodies are wonderful as they are.
Just leave them alone.
ever has, or ever could have done.
I was born in Britain, as you have probably guessed.
Even when on its worst behavior,
I find myself automatically defending the USA
from the sneers of green-eyed Europhiles
playing their Greek card to Roman trumps.
America is an empire.
I hope you know that now.
All empires, by definition, are bumbling,
shambolic, bullying, bureaucratic affairs,
as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy,
as they are corrupted by power in their dotage.
I am no historian, ladies and gentlemen.
But it seems to be that the USA's sins,
compared to those of many previous empires,
are of a more moderate,
if more pervasive, kind.
Let me put this bluntly.
If Americans are so fat,
stupid and ignorant,
my dear friends from Birmingham,
how come they rule the world?
I, who by a miracle have 22 godchildren --
the answer is in this poem,
which upsets me every time I read it.
shy as a fawn.
she fled, with the dawn.
waxed hot as the pits.
his terror unfeigned.
by night and by day,
and sick of our lives.
shy as a fawn.
she fled with the dawn.
I've got far too much money and I have far too much fun
in my businesses.
So poetry came as a complete shock to me, ladies and gentlemen.
A complete shock. I was a little ill.
Okay, I was ill.
Okay, I had a life-threatening illness, you know.
I was in a clinic. I wasn't allowed to make telephone calls.
I wasn't allowed to see any of my -- you know, whatever.
So, in the end I begged a pack of Post-it notes off a nurse.
And from another nurse, I begged a pencil, pen.
And I didn't know what else to do. So I started to write poetry.
That was in October of 2000.
But sometimes I try to put myself in an evil man's position.
I'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman,
who men fall down, you know, when she walks in a room.
But sometimes I try to put myself in that position.
(Laughter)
Not with much success.
But it's interesting to me. I love to write historical verse.
I love to think what they thought, what it was like.
many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience,
although you guys can not only go to the moon,
you know, you're going to totally transform everything.
Cloning will transform everything. Voice navigation will transform everything.
I don't know. You can do anything you want.
All you guys are so clever, and women, you can do it all!
My friends, human nature is exactly the same as it was
when my ancestor --
probably it was my ancestor --
got his hands around the neck of the last Neanderthal,
and battered the bastard to death.
You think we didn't do that?
Oh, we did.
We killed every single one of them.
Inch by inch we killed them.
We hunted them down wherever they were.
Rivals for meat. Rivals for berries.
We're still doing it,
with all of the genius assembled in this room.
Our natures haven't changed a single iota.
And they never will.
Even when we've got off this little planet,
and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets.
I spent eight years
running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world.
And at seven o'clock every night,
I took me some more girls, already corrupted.
I never did anything to anyone that wasn't.
And I took crack cocaine,
every single night for seven years.
It was like Dante's "Inferno."
It was unbelievable.
One of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection
for about four hours.
And you stay up for 12.
It was absolutely unbelievable.
Twenty-two godchildren I've got.
What do I say to them?
I only stopped because I thought if I got caught,
what would happen to my mother.
If you're a woman, remember that.
The love of your son
can utterly transform anything he does.

Denying our thirsts.

grew haggard and limp.
or threatened her pimp.
I fled the abyss.
I have had the distinct pleasure
of living inside two biospheres.
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.
here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.
And then of course I have to milk the goats
and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.
It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,
because I pick up the phone and I call and say,
"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"
was essentially a three-acre,
entirely sealed, miniature world
that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.
(Laughter)
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass,
underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --
essentially entirely sealed.
So we had our own miniature rainforest,
a private beach with a coral reef.
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.
And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.
we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.
I mean, what is a biosphere?
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now
that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.
And so we decided that what it really is
is that it is entirely materially closed --
that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material --
and energetically open,
which is essentially what planet Earth is.
that we called our Test Module.
And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,
walked in, to spend a couple of days in there
with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there
to hopefully keep him alive,
the doctors were incredibly concerned
that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,
or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.
But of course none of that happened.
there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.
But by 1991
we finally had this thing built.
And it was time for us to go in
and give it a go.
We needed to know,
is life this malleable?
Can you take this biosphere,
that has evolved on a planetary scale,
and jam it into a little bottle,
and will it survive?
Big questions.
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else
in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,
would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about
the Earth that we all live in.
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in
and try out this baby.
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.
Will it work? Or will something happen
that we can't understand and we can't fix,
thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?
More on that later.
(Laughter)
And this is the world that we lived in.
So, on the top, we had
these beautiful rainforests and an ocean,
and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,
which is where all the pumps and the valves
and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden
on top of an aircraft carrier."
And then also we had the human habitat of course,
with the laboratories, and all of that.
This is the agriculture.
It was essentially an organic farm.
I was, for the first time,
breathing a completely different atmosphere
than everybody else in the world,
except seven other people.
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense;
I mean it rather literally.
When I breathed out, my CO2
fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.
(Laughter)
And those sweet potatoes
became part of me.
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes
I became orange with sweet potato.
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.
it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,
because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.
And we knew that we were losing CO2.
And so we were working to sequester carbon.
Good lord -- we know that term now.
We were growing plants like crazy.
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,
growing plants, going around, around, around,
trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.
We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.
We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.
But our oxygen was going down faster
than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,
because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.
And we had no clue where it was.
and our oxygen went down quite far;
it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent --
my goodness, do you feel dreadful.
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.
And we had sleep apnea at night.
So you'd wake up gasping with breath,
because your blood chemistry has changed.
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) --
take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.
And everybody outside thought we were dying.
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us
to make sure we were, in fact, fine.
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.
And you might think, well,
"Boy, your life support system
was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door
at any time, if it really got bad,
though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?
Not me, that was for sure.
because we could really crank this baby up,
as a scientific tool,
and see if we could, in fact, find
where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.
And we did indeed find it.
And we found it in the concrete.
Essentially it had done something very simple.
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.
It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;
it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.
Pretty straightforward really.
when we came out, we were elated,
because, in fact, although you might say
we had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"
when your oxygen is going down,
stopped working, essentially, in your life support system,
that's a very bad failure.
Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.
And nothing else emerged
that really was as serious as that.
And we proved the concept, more or less.
People, on the other hand, was a different subject.
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.
We all went quite nuts, I will say.
I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.
For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.
And everybody ran up to me.
And I recoiled. They stank!
People stink!
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,
and all kinds of stuff.
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,
but nothing with perfume.
And boy do we stink out here.
Not only that,
but I lost touch of where my food came from.
I had been growing all my own food.
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.
In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,
reading all the names on all of the things.
People must have thought I was nuts.
It was really quite astonishing.
And I slowly lost track
of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood
that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,
and it had an impact on me,
very viscerally, very literally.
Paragon Space Development Corporation,
a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,
because I had nothing else to do.
And one of the things we did was
try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,
and what can you do with them?
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,
for 16 months, where we managed to produce
the first organisms to go through
complete multiple life cycles in space --
really pushing the envelope
of understanding how malleable
our life systems are.
that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce
that we're actually forming a team
to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,
which is going to be pretty fun.
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:
an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.
And part of that is that we had to model
very rapid circulation of CO2
and oxygen and water through this plant system.
I ended up in all places,
in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,
is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,
incredibly stark, and I have no understanding
of how people eke out a living there.
It is so dry.
This is what I saw.
But this is also what I saw.
I saw a company that had
taken seawater
and sand, and they were growing
a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.
And it will produce a food crop.
In this case it was oilseed.
It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves
in a plantation.
And the mangroves were providing wood
and honey and leaves for the animals,
so that they could produce milk and whatnot,
like we had in the Biosphere.
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,
frankly, from an environmental point of view.
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.
And what this project was doing
was taking the effluent of these,
and turning them into all of this food.
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.
They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.
for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.
Kyoto Protocol system.
And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,
I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"
When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,
I know where to draw the boundary.
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.
And put your project in that context.
from what I would call a biocidal species,
one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally --
have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.
This is in fact, this beautiful photograph,
is in fact over the Amazon.
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.
And those beautiful wispy clouds
are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.
We're in the process of transforming from this,
to what I would call a biophilic society,
one where we learn to nurture society.
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.
It is happening all across the world,
in every kind of walk of life,
and every kind of career
and industry that you can think of.
And I think often times people get lost in that.
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?
It's such a huge subject."
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.
This was my backyard,
very early on, when I bought my property.
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,
and I want to throttle them.
It's a certain type of aesthetic.
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.
And I threw away my rake.
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.
And over time, essentially what have I been doing?
I've been building topsoil.
And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.
And I have an oasis.
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks,
six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.
This is actually in a riparian area.
And all of Tucson could be like this
if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.
The small stuff counts.
has given us this, the ability to light up the world.
It has also given us this,
the ability to look at the world from the outside.
Now we may not all have
another biosphere that we can run to,
and compare it to this biosphere.
But we can look at the world,
and try to understand where we are in its context,
and how we choose to interact with it.
or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting
with where you are in the biosphere,
I would say to you,
take a deep breath.
The yogis had it right.
Breath does, in fact, connect us all
in a very literal way.
Take a breath now.
And as you breathe, think
about what is in your breath.
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen
from some algae on the beach not far from here.
It also connects us in time.
There may be some carbon in your breath
from the dinosaurs.
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now
that will be in the breath
of your great-great-great-grandchildren.
Thank you. (Applause)
It's not linear. And our intuition is linear.
When we walked through the savanna a thousand years ago
There is a big difference between linear and exponential growth.
If I take 30 steps linearly -- one, two, three, four, five --
I get to 30.
If I take 30 steps exponentially -- two, four, eight, 16 --
I get to a billion.
It makes a huge difference.
And that really describes information technology.
we all shared one computer that took up a whole building.
The computer in your cellphone today is a million times cheaper,
a million times smaller,
a thousand times more powerful.
That's a billion-fold increase in capability per dollar
through a series of S-curves
where each one is a different paradigm.
We'll then go to the next paradigm.
And Moore's Law was not the first paradigm
to bring exponential growth to computing.
The exponential growth of computing started
but it was not the end of the exponential growth of computing.
fantastic scale of progress,
through war and peace, through boom times and recessions.
so I could present it here, to 2007.
And I was asked, "Well aren't you nervous?
Maybe it kind of didn't stay on this exponential progression."
I was a little nervous
because maybe the data wouldn't be right,
I've been making these forward-looking predictions for about 30 years.
And the cost of a transistor cycle,
like DNA data or brain data.
But we more than make up for that.
We actually ship more than twice as much
of every form of information technology.
We've had 18 percent growth in constant dollars
The amount of DNA data
we've sequenced has doubled every year.
The cost has come down by half every year.
And this has been a smooth progression
since the beginning of the genome project.
And halfway through the project, skeptics said,
you get 100 percent. And the project was finished on time.
50 different ways to measure this,
the number of bits being moved around, the size of the Internet.
But this has progressed at an exponential pace.
This is deeply democratizing.
I wrote, over 20 years ago in "The Age of Intelligent Machines,"
when the Soviet Union was going strong, that it would be swept away
by this growth of decentralized communication.
to do things like simulate regions of the human brain.
But where will we get the software?
Some critics say, "Oh, well software is stuck in the mud."
And we're showing that we can actually turn this data
into working models and simulations of brain regions.
the auditory cortex, regions of the visual cortex;
cerebellum, where we do our skill formation;
fueled by this information technology.
Well this is a logarithmic graph.
This represents a smooth doubling,
every two years, of the amount of solar energy we're creating,
particularly as we're now applying nanotechnology,
a form of information technology, to solar panels.
And we're only eight doublings away
from it meeting 100 percent of our energy needs.
And there is 10 thousand times more sunlight than we need.
our health and our intelligence,
as we get closer and closer to this technology.
that's founded by Peter Diamandis, who is here in the audience,
and myself.
It's backed by NASA and Google,
and other leaders in the high-tech and science community.
And our goal was to assemble the leaders,
both teachers and students,
to actually addressing some of the major challenges facing humanity.
And if we did that, then Google would back this.
And so that's what we've done.
will be devoted to a group project to address
some major challenge of humanity.
All the intellectual property that is created and taught
will be online and available,
and developed online in a collaborative fashion.
But this is being announced today.
It will be permanently headquartered in Silicon Valley,
at the NASA Ames research center.
Then we are going to apply them to the other areas,
like energy, ecology,
And we invite you to participate. Thank you very much.
College presidents are not the first people who come to mind
when the subject is the uses of the creative imagination.
So I thought I'd start by telling you how I got here.
I was invited to meet with leading educators
from the newly free Eastern Europe and Russia.
They were trying to figure out how to rebuild their universities.
Since education under the Soviet Union
was essentially propaganda
serving the purposes of a state ideology,
they appreciated that it would take wholesale transformations
if they were to provide an education
worthy of free men and women.
Given this rare opportunity
to start fresh,
they chose liberal arts
as the most compelling model
because of its historic commitment
to furthering its students' broadest intellectual,
and deepest ethical potential.
they came to the United States,
home of liberal arts education,
to talk with some of us
most closely identified
with that kind of education.
They spoke with a passion, an urgency,
an intellectual conviction
that, for me, was a voice I had not heard in decades,
a dream long forgotten.
For, in truth, we had moved light years
from the passions that animated them.
But for me, unlike them,
in my world, the slate was not clean,
and what was written on it was not encouraging.
no longer exists --
at least genuine liberal arts education -- in this country.
We have professionalized liberal arts to the point
where they no longer provide the breadth of application
and the enhanced capacity for civic engagement
that is their signature.
Over the past century
the expert has dethroned the educated generalist
to become the sole model
of intellectual accomplishment. (Applause)
But the price of its dominance is enormous.
Subject matters are broken up
into smaller and smaller pieces,
with increasing emphasis on the technical and the obscure.
We have even managed to make the study of literature arcane.
You may think you know what is going on
in that Jane Austen novel --
that is, until your first encounter
with postmodern deconstructionism.
is to jettison every interest except one.
And within that one, to continually narrow the focus,
learning more and more about less and less;
this, despite the evidence all around us
of the interconnectedness of things.
Lest you think I exaggerate,
here are the beginnings of the A-B-Cs of anthropology.
As one moves up the ladder,
values other than technical competence
are viewed with increasing suspicion.
Questions such as,
"What kind of a world are we making?
What kind of a world should we be making?
What kind of a world can we be making?"
are treated with more and more skepticism,
and move off the table.
in effect yield the connection
between education and values
to fundamentalists,
who, you can be sure,
have no compunctions about using education
to further their values:
the absolutes of a theocracy.
Meanwhile, the values and voices of democracy are silent.
Either we have lost touch with those values
or, no better,
believe they need not
or cannot be taught.
This aversion to social values
may seem at odds with the explosion
of community service programs.
But despite the attention paid to these efforts,
they remain emphatically extracurricular.
In effect, civic-mindedness is treated
as outside the realm of what purports to be
serious thinking and adult purposes.
Simply put, when the impulse is to change the world,
the academy is more likely to engender
a learned helplessness
than to create a sense of empowerment.
idealization of the expert,
fragmentation of knowledge,
emphasis on technical mastery,
neutrality as a condition of academic integrity --
is toxic when it comes to pursuing the vital connections
between education and the public good,
between intellectual integrity
and human freedom,
which were at the heart --
(Applause) -- of the challenge posed to and by
my European colleagues.
When the astronomical distance
between the realities of the academy
and the visionary intensity of this challenge
were more than enough, I can assure you,
to give one pause,
what was happening outside higher education
made backing off unthinkable.
inequities in the distribution of wealth,
lack of a sane policy or a sustainable policy
with respect to the continuing uses of energy,
we were in desperate straits.
And that was only the beginning.
The corrupting of our political life
had become a living nightmare;
nothing was exempt --
separation of powers, civil liberties,
the rule of law,
the relationship of church and state.
Accompanied by a squandering
of the nation's material wealth
that defied credulity.
A harrowing predilection for the uses of force
had become commonplace,
with an equal distaste
for the alternative forms of influence.
At the same time, all of our firepower was impotent
when it came to halting or even stemming
the slaughter in Rwanda, Darfur, Myanmar.
has become most noteworthy
for its failures.
Mastery of basic skills and a bare minimum of cultural literacy
eludes vast numbers of our students.
Despite having a research establishment
that is the envy of the world,
more than half of the American public
don't believe in evolution.
And don't press your luck
about how much those who do believe in it
actually understand it.
with all its material, intellectual and spiritual resources,
seems utterly helpless
to reverse the freefall in any of these areas.
Equally startling, from my point of view,
is the fact that no one
was drawing any connections
between what is happening to the body politic,
and what is happening in our leading educational institutions.
We may be at the top of the list
when it comes to influencing access to personal wealth.
We are not even on the list
when it comes to our responsibility
for the health of this democracy.
We are playing with fire.
You can be sure Jefferson knew
what he was talking about when he said,
"If a nation expects to be ignorant and free
in a state of civilization,
it expects what never was,
and never will be."
(Applause)
this betrayal of our principles,
our decency, our hope,
made it impossible for me
to avoid the question,
"What will I say, years from now,
when people ask, 'Where were you?'"
As president of a leading liberal arts college,
famous for its innovative history,
there were no excuses.
So the conversation began at Bennington.
Knowing that if we were to regain
the integrity of liberal education,
it would take radical rethinking
of basic assumptions,
beginning with our priorities.
Enhancing the public good becomes a primary objective.
The accomplishment of civic virtue
is tied to the uses of intellect and imagination
at their most challenging.
turn inside out to reflect the reality
that no one has the answers
to the challenges facing citizens in this century,
and everyone has the responsibility
for trying and participating in finding them.
Bennington would continue to teach the arts and sciences
as areas of immersion that acknowledge differences
in personal and professional objectives.
But the balances redressed,
our shared purposes assume an equal
if not greater importance.
The idea is to make the political-social challenges themselves --
from health and education
to the uses of force --
the organizers of the curriculum.
They would assume the commanding role of traditional disciplines.
But structures designed to connect, rather than divide
mutually dependent circles,
rather than isolating triangles.
And the point is not to treat these topics
as topics of study,
but as frameworks of action.
The challenge: to figure out what it will take
to actually do something
that makes a significant and sustainable difference.
an emphasis on action provides a special urgency to thinking.
The importance of coming to grips with values like justice,
equity, truth,
becomes increasingly evident
as students discover that interest alone
cannot tell them what they need to know
when the issue is rethinking education,
our approach to health,
or strategies for achieving
an economics of equity.
The value of the past also comes alive;
it provides a lot of company.
You are not the first to try to figure this out,
just as you are unlikely to be the last.
Even more valuable,
history provides a laboratory
in which we see played out
the actual, as well as the intended
consequences of ideas.
"Deep thought matters
when you're contemplating what to do
about things that matter."
A new liberal arts that can support this
action-oriented curriculum
has begun to emerge.
Rhetoric, the art of organizing the world of words
to maximum effect.
Design, the art of organizing the world of things.
Mediation and improvisation
also assume a special place in this new pantheon.
Quantitative reasoning attains its proper position
at the heart of what it takes to manage change
where measurement is crucial.
As is a capacity to discriminate
systematically between what is at the core
and what is at the periphery.
the power of technology emerges with special intensity.
But so does the importance of content.
The more powerful our reach,
the more important the question "About what?"
When improvisation, resourcefulness, imagination are key,
artists, at long last,
take their place at the table,
when strategies of action are in the process of being designed.
In this dramatically expanded ideal
of a liberal arts education
where the continuum of thought and action is its life's blood,
knowledge honed outside the academy
becomes essential.
Social activists, business leaders,
lawyers, politicians, professionals
will join the faculty as active and ongoing participants
in this wedding of liberal education to the advancement of the public good.
Students, in turn, continuously move outside the classroom
to engage the world directly.
needs new bottles
if we are to capture the liveliness and dynamism
of this idea.
The most important discovery we made
in our focus on public action
was to appreciate that the hard choices
are not between good and evil,
but between competing goods.
This discovery is transforming.
It undercuts self-righteousness,
radically alters the tone and character of controversy,
and enriches dramatically
the possibilities for finding common ground.
Ideology, zealotry,
unsubstantiated opinions simply won't do.
This is a political education, to be sure.
But it is a politics of principle,
not of partisanship.
So the challenge for Bennington is to do it.
is the architect's sketch of a building
opening in 2010
that is to be a center for the advancement
of public action.
The center will embody and sustain this new educational commitment.
Think of it as a kind of secular church.
The words on the card describe what will happen inside.
We intend to turn the intellectual
and imaginative power, passion and boldness
of our students, faculty and staff
to developing strategies
for acting on the critical challenges of our time.
While these past weeks have been a time
of national exhilaration in this country,
it would be tragic if you thought this meant
your job was done.
The glacial silence we have experienced
in the face of the shredding of the constitution,
the unraveling of our public institutions,
the deterioration of our infrastructure
is not limited to the universities.
We the people
have become inured to our own irrelevance
when it comes to doing anything significant
about anything that matters
concerning governance,
beyond waiting another four years.
We persist also
in being sidelined by the idea of the expert
as the only one capable of coming up with answers,
despite the overwhelming evidence to the contrary.
as a viable democracy made up of experts,
zealots, politicians and spectators.
(Applause)
People will continue and should continue
to learn everything there is to know about something or other.
We actually do it all the time.
And there will be and should be
those who spend a lifetime
pursuing a very highly defined area of inquiry.
But this single-mindedness will not yield
the flexibilities of mind,
the multiplicity of perspectives,
the capacities for collaboration and innovation
this country needs.
That is where you come in.
What is certain is that the individual talent
exhibited in such abundance here,
needs to turn its attention
to that collaborative, messy, frustrating,
contentious and impossible world
of politics and public policy.
President Obama and his team
simply cannot do it alone.
you are at the beginning, not the end of this adventure.
Being overwhelmed is the first step
if you are serious about trying to get at things that really matter,
on a scale that makes a difference.
So what do you do when you feel overwhelmed?
Well, you have two things.
You have a mind. And you have other people.
Start with those, and change the world.
I have a big impact on the planet
to travel here by plane.
I emitted, in the atmosphere, nine tons of CO2;
that is the weight of two elephants.
I came here to speak about ecology,
and I emitted as much CO2
as a Frenchman in one year.
So what do I have to do?
I have to kill a Frenchman when I come back at home?
(Laughter)
I have to do my carbon offset in another way,
like I do every time.
(Laughter)
our impact on our planet.
I'm going to show you some examples
of the last pictures I've done
in the last year.
You know the problem;
we don't want to believe what we know.
In Alberta people work nonstop,
24 hours by seven
to extract as much oil
as they can.
We know about the end of oil.
Oil sand is not a long-term solution.
But we use three times more oil
than we find every year.
We don't want to believe what we know.
Deny.
100 percent of the coral
may be wiped out before 2050
because of global warming.
And you know how coral are very sensitive to temperature,
and are very important for the biodiversity of the sea.
It was impossible to do this picture 15 years ago.
Now there is a new way open between Atlantic and Pacific.
The thickness of the Arctic
decreased more than 40 percent
since 1960.
Sad picture.
It lost 80 percent of its ice.
According to scientists,
in 100 years
all the mountain glacier will be gone.
Glaciers are very important for the life on earth.
Like Al Gore told you,
two billion people live on the water
from the glacier of Himalaya.
One fifth of human kind
depend on fish to live.
Today now 70 percent
of the fish stock are over-exploited.
According to FAO,
if we don't change our system of fishing
the main sea resources will be gone in 2050.
We don't want to believe what we know.
One human of six
have not enough to eat in the world.
One billion people have not enough to eat.
In Africa, corn is one of the main foods in many places.
Here in America,
90 percent of the corn cultivated
is used to feed animals or to do oil.
Every year we lose 50 thousand square miles in deforestation.
Today we have 20 million refugees in the world.
According to the U.N.,
we speak about 250 million refugees
in 2050.
We have done already 100 exhibitions in the cities.
But how to understand the world
without the voice of people?
Landscape was not enough.
It was obvious to me to do another work.
I launched a project named Six Billion Others.
I sent around the world six cameramen
asking the same question,
the same crucial question,
about life.
We have done five thousand interviews.
I'm going to show you this.
It's when my dad told me, "Here, I give you this girl as your fiance."
this is love! Third Man: My greatest fear is ...
Fifth Man: ... from my childhood, (Sixth Man: that you should respect humans.)
Fifth Man: we were having fun, biking. (Sixth Man: I will never forget those words.)
Ninth Man: You see, family is ... it's awful.
and speak to the people,
I'd have to bow down and kiss their feet.
Just as that woman tried to kiss my feet
when we were taking her sons.
I feel ashamed.
And I feel humbled
by their strength.
And I will forever feel a need
to make reparations to Iraq.
You shouldn't worry about me. Dad doesn't need to go to work.
My family ... What can I say?
At the moment, my family is very poor,
my life here in Shenzhen is just about showing myself that I can earn more
and to let my parents stay and have something to live on.
I don't want them to spend their whole lives in poverty.
If someday I can achieve something, I would like to say thank you daddy and mommy.
Thank you.
Thank you for having fed me and raised me,
and for making my life of today. Thank you.
I've done more in life being in a chair
than out of a chair.
I still surf. I sail the world. I freedive.
After many people said I couldn't do that.
And I think that comes from connecting with nature,
connecting with the energy of life,
because we're all disabled in some way on the planet --
spiritually, mentally or physically.
I got the easy part.
You come from elsewhere.
You don't know me. I don't know you.
We talk without lying.
If I do like you, I give you one cow and many other things
and we become friends.
How can we make it all by ourselves?
answer -- respond to the questions also.
Forty crucial questions.
For the last three years,
I was shooting the earth for the movie.
The name of the movie is "Home" --
"Maison."
It is about the state of the planet.
It's a fantastic story of life on the earth.
I'm very proud to show you the teaser.
These plants, several hundred million years old.
And we humans have been walking upright
for only 200 thousand years.
We've managed to adapt,
and have conquered the whole planet.
For generations, we've been raising our children,
not unlike millions of other species living beside us.
For the past 30 years
I've been closely watching the earth and its dwellers
from high up in the sky.
Our life is tied to the well-being of our planet.
We depend on water,
forests,
deserts,
oceans.
Fishing,
breeding,
farming
are still the world's foremost human occupations.
And what binds us together
is far greater than what divides us.
We all share the same need for the earth's gifts --
the same wish to rise above ourselves,
and become better.
And yet we carry on raising walls
to keep us apart.
is to protect the natural offerings of our planet.
In less than 50 years
we've altered it more thoroughly
than in the entire history of mankind.
Half of the world's forests have vanished.
Water resources are running low.
Intensive farming is depleting soils.
Our energy sources are not sustainable.
The climate is changing.
We are endangering ourselves.
We're only trying to improve our lives.
But the wealth gaps are growing wider.
We haven't yet understood
that we're going at a much faster pace
than the planet can sustain.
We know that solutions are available today.
We all have the power to change this trend
for the better.
So what are we waiting for?
(Applause)
But it is not a normal movie.
The film is going to be distributed free.
This film has no copyright.
On the five of June,
the environment day,
everybody can download the movie on Internet.
The film is given for free
to the distributor for TV and theater
to show it the fifth of June.
There is no business on this movie.
It is also available for school,
cities, NGOs and you.
Let me tell you something.
It's too late to be pessimistic --
really too late.
We have all a part of the solutions.
To finish,
I would like to welcome
the 4,700th baby
born since the beginning of this talk.
Merci beaucoup. I love you.
(Applause)
I was thinking about my place in the universe,
and about my first thought about what infinity might mean,
when I was a child.
And I thought that if time could reach
forwards and backwards infinitely,
doesn't that mean that
every point in time is really infinitely small,
and therefore somewhat meaningless.
So we don't really have a place in the universe,
as far as on a time line.
But nothing else does either.
Therefore every moment really is the most important moment
that's ever happened, including this moment right now.
And so therefore this music you're about to hear
is maybe the most important music
you'll ever hear in your life.
Thank you.
(Applause)
you could please refrain from saying,
"Oh my god, you're so much shorter in real life."
(Laughter)
Because it's like the stage is an optical illusion,
for some reason.
(Laughter)
Somewhat like the curving of the universe.
"My god, you're guitars are so gigantic!"
(Laughter)
"You must get them custom made -- special, humongous guitars."
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
All human life,
all life, depends on plants.
Let me try to convince you of that in a few seconds.
Just think for a moment.
It doesn't matter whether you live in a small African village,
or you live in a big city,
everything comes back to plants in the end:
whether it's for the food, the medicine,
the fuel, the construction, the clothing, all the obvious things;
or whether it's for the spiritual and recreational things
that matter to us so much;
or whether it's soil formation,
or the effect on the atmosphere,
or primary production.
Damn it, even the books here are made out of plants.
All these things, they come back to plants.
And without them we wouldn't be here.
They're under threat because of changing climate.
And they are also under threat because they are sharing a planet
with people like us.
And people like us want to do things that destroy plants,
and their habitats.
And whether that's because of food production,
or because of the introduction of alien plants
into places that they really oughtn't be,
or because of habitats being used for other purposes --
all these things are meaning that plants have to adapt,
or die, or move.
And plants sometimes find it rather difficult to move
because there might be cities and other things in the way.
doesn't it make sense that perhaps we should try to save them?
I think it does.
And I want to tell you about a project to save plants.
And the way that you save plants
is by storing seeds.
Because seeds, in all their diverse glory,
are plants' futures.
All the genetic information for future generations of plants
are held in seeds.
So here is the building;
it looks rather unassuming, really.
But it goes down below ground many stories.
And it's the largest seed bank in the world.
It exists not only in southern England,
but distributed around the world. I'll come to that.
This is a nuclear-proof facility.
God forbid that it should have to withstand that.
what you're going to store in it. Right?
And we decided that what we want to store first of all,
are the species that are most under threat.
And those are the dry land species.
So first of all we did deals
with 50 different countries.
It means negotiating with heads of state,
and with secretaries of state in 50 countries
to sign treaties.
We have 120 partner institutions all over the world,
in all those countries colored orange.
People come from all over the world to learn,
and then they go away and plan exactly how
they're going to collect these seeds.
They have thousands of people all over the world
tagging places where those plants are said to exist.
They search for them. They find them in flower.
And they go back when their seeds have arrived.
And they collect the seeds. All over the world.
You kind of shovel them all in to bags and dry them off.
You label them. You do some high-tech things here and there,
some low-tech things here and there.
And the main thing is that you have to dry them
very carefully, at low temperature.
And then you have to store them
at about minus 20 degrees C --
that's about minus four Fahrenheit, I think --
with a very critically low moisture content.
And these seeds will be able to germinate,
we believe, with many of the species,
in thousands of years,
and certainly in hundreds of years.
So every 10 years we do germination tests
on every sample of seeds that we have.
And this is a distributed network.
So all around the world people are doing the same thing.
And that enables us to develop germination protocols.
That means that we know the right combination of heat
and cold and the cycles that you have to get
to make the seed germinate.
And that is very useful information.
And then we grow these things,
and we tell people, back in the countries where these seeds have come from,
"Look, actually we're not just storing this
to get the seeds later,
but we can give you this information about
how to germinate these difficult plants."
And that's already happening.
I am pleased to unveil that our three billionth seed --
that's three thousand millionth seed --
is now stored.
Ten percent of all plant species on the planet,
24,000 species are safe;
30,000 species, if we get the funding, by next year.
Twenty-five percent of all the world's plants, by 2020.
These are not just crop plants,
as you might have seen stored in Svalbard in Norway --
fantastic work there.
This is at least 100 times bigger.
We have thousands of collections that have been sent out
all over the world:
drought-tolerant forest species sent to Pakistan and Egypt;
especially photosynthetic-efficient plants
come here to the United States;
salt-tolerant pasture species sent to Australia;
the list goes on and on.
So in habitats that have already been damaged,
like the tall grass prairie here in the USA,
or in mined land in various countries,
restoration is already happening because of these species --
and because of this collection.
Some of these plants, like the ones on the bottom
to the left of your screen,
they are down to the last few remaining members.
The one where the guy is collecting seeds there on the truck,
that is down to about 30 last remaining trees.
Fantastically useful plant,
both for protein and for medicine.
and many other countries.
How much does it cost?
2,800 dollars per species is the average.
I think that's cheap, at the price.
And that gets you all the scientific data
that goes with it.
The future research is "How can we find
the genetic and molecular markers
for the viability of seeds,
without having to plant them every 10 years?"
And we're almost there.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
deafening crowds,
Okay, religious mania:
there's rapture, there's weeping,
there's visions.
Manias can be good.
Manias can be alarming.
A mania for learning English.
by screaming it:
you start learning English in the third grade, by law.
That's why this year,
China will become the world's largest English-speaking country.
like climate change or poverty,
or hunger or disease.
The world has other universal languages.
Mathematics is the language of science.
Not because America is pushing it,
but because the world is pulling it.
English represents hope
for a better future --
a future where the world has a common language
Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration
starts with a conversation.
And I would like to share with you
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state
with too much time on my hands.
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil
that I built in my bedroom,
much to the dismay of my mother.
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.
(Laughter)
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --
also the U.S. and Japan.
We had a lot that got us excited.
So we decided to do a special project together.
To combine engineering and design and ...
(Laughter)
(Applause)
This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It's twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
It's got an amazing user experience.
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
He came up with our name and logo. We're Mission Motors.
And we've only got three minutes,
but we could talk about it for hours.
(Applause)
I'm here because I have a very important message:
I think we have found
the most important factor for success.
And it was found close to here, Stanford.
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old
and put them in a room all by themselves.
And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,
"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow
for 15 minutes.
If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,
you will get another one. So you will have two."
To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes
for something that they like,
is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."
(Laughter)
Exact equivalent.
As soon as the door closed...
two out of three ate the marshmallow.
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,
two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.
(Laughter)
Couldn't do it. Could not wait.
What's interesting is that one out of three
would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...
Would look at it.
Put it back.
They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants.
the most important principle for success,
which is the ability to delay gratification.
Self-discipline:
the most important factor for success.
15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,
follow-up study.
What did they find?
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.
And they found that 100 percent
of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.
They were happy. They had their plans.
They had good relationships with the teachers, students.
They were doing fine.
they were in trouble.
They did not make it to university.
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.
A few were still there with bad grades.
A few had good grades.
react the same way as the American kids?
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.
And let me show you what happened.
Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;
one out of three did not.
This little girl was interesting;
she ate the inside of the marshmallow.
(Laughter)
In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.
But she ate it.
So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.
(Laughter)
She should not go into banking, for example,
or work at a cash register.
But she will be successful.
The sales person that --
the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are."
That person ate the marshmallow.
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."
Then you sell a lot more.
So this has applications in all walks of life.
You know what? This is so good
that we want a marshmallow book for children.
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.
And we need to learn that principle here in the States,
because we have a big debt.
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.
Thank you so much.
Two years ago here at TED
I reported that we had discovered
at Saturn, with the Cassini Spacecraft,
an anomalously warm and geologically active region
at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon
Enceladus, seen here.
This region seen here for the first time
in the Cassini image taken in 2005. This is the south polar region,
with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole.
And seen just recently in late 2008,
here is that region again,
now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere
is experiencing the onset of August
and eventually winter.
this once-in-a-lifetime discovery
of towering jets
erupting from those fractures at the south pole,
consisting of tiny water ice crystals
accompanied by water vapor
and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane.
And at that time two years ago
I mentioned that we were speculating
that these jets might in fact be geysers,
and erupting from pockets
or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface,
but we weren't really sure.
However, the implications of those results --
of a possible environment within this moon
that could support prebiotic chemistry,
and perhaps life itself --
were so exciting that, in the intervening two years,
we have focused more on Enceladus.
by this moon now several times,
flying closer and deeper into these jets,
into the denser regions of these jets,
so that now we have come away with some
very precise compositional measurements.
And we have found
that the organic compounds coming from this moon
are in fact more complex than we previously reported.
While they're not amino acids,
we're now finding things like
propane and benzene,
hydrogen cyanide, and formaldehyde.
And the tiny water crystals here
now look for all the world
like they are frozen droplets of salty water,
which is a discovery that suggests
that not only do the jets come from
pockets of liquid water,
but that that liquid water is in contact with rock.
And that is a circumstance
that could supply the chemical energy
and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life.
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago
that we might indeed
have on this moon, under the south pole,
an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms.
Whether or not there are living organisms there, of course,
is an entirely different matter.
And that will have to await the arrival,
back at Enceladus,
of the spacecrafts, hopefully some time in the near future,
specifically equipped to address that particular question.
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day
when we might journey to the Saturnine system,
and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park,
just because we can.
The title is "Observations of In-Utero Masturbation."
"The hand grasping the penis in a fashion resembling masturbation movements."
Bear in mind this was an ultrasound,
so it would have been moving images.
Now, this is the part of the nervous system
that deals with the things that we don't consciously control,
like digestion, heart rate and sexual arousal.
Genital stimulation. Duh.
But also, Kinsey interviewed a woman
People with spinal cord injuries,
like paraplegias, quadriplegias,
will often develop a very, very sensitive area
right above the level of their injury,
wherever that is.
There is such a thing as a knee orgasm in the literature.
was a case report of a woman
who had an orgasm every time she brushed her teeth.
was triggering orgasm.
And she went to a neurologist, who was fascinated.
He checked to see if it was something in the toothpaste,
but no -- it happened with any brand.
No. It was the whole, you know, motion.
And the amazing thing to me
and switched to mouthwash for her oral care."
It's so sad.
I interviewed a woman who can think herself to orgasm.
She was part of a study at Rutgers University.
You've got to love that. Rutgers.
And I said, "So, could you do it right here?"
It was remarkable. It took about one minute.
And I said to her,
"Are you just doing this all the time?"
was on the Disneyland tram.
And if you trigger, if you stimulate with an electrode,
the precise spot, you will trigger an orgasm.
a certain kind of dead person, a beating-heart cadaver.
Now this is somebody who is brain-dead,
legally dead, definitely checked out,
but is being kept alive on a respirator,
Now in one of these brain-dead people,
if you trigger the right spot,
you will see something every now and then.
There is a reflex called the Lazarus reflex.
And this is -- I'll demonstrate as best I can, not being dead.
It's like this. You trigger the spot.
The dead guy, or gal, goes... like that.
Very unsettling for people working in pathology labs.
I asked this question to a brain death expert,
Stephanie Mann, who was foolish enough to return my emails.
Obviously it wouldn't be as much fun for the person.
But it would be an orgasm --
I said to her, "You should do an experiment.
You know? You can get cadavers if you work at a university."
I said, "You should actually do this."
She said, "You get the human subjects review board approval for this one."
Theodoor van De Velde,
a slight seminal odor can be detected on the breath of a woman
Theodoor van De Velde was something of a semen connoisseur.
But he wrote in this book, "Ideal Marriage" --
he said that he could differentiate between the semen of a young man,
which he said had a fresh, exhilarating smell,
"Remarkably like that of the flowers of the Spanish chestnut.
Sometimes quite freshly floral,
and then again sometimes extremely pungent."
And this was one of those cases that went on and on.
He tried everything his friends suggested.
Nothing seemed to help.
And lo and behold, the hiccups went away.
He told his doctor, who published a case report
in a Canadian medical journal under the title,
I love this article because at a certain point they suggested
that unattached hiccuppers could try masturbation.
the contractions serve to suck the semen up through the cervix
and sort of deliver it really quickly to the egg,
thereby upping the odds of conception.
It was called the "upsuck" theory.
physicians believed that orgasm in women
was not just helpful for conception, but necessary.
Doctors back then were routinely telling men
the importance of pleasuring their wives.
He had this line in his book
that supposedly comes from the Habsburg Monarchy,
where there was an empress Maria Theresa,
who was having trouble conceiving.
And apparently the royal court physician said to her,
be titillated for some time prior to intercourse."
Masters and Johnson were upsuck skeptics,
which is also really fun to say.
They didn't buy it.
And they decided, being Masters and Johnson,
that they would get to the bottom of it.
They brought women into the lab -- I think it was five women --
such that it would show up on an X-ray.
Anyway, these women sat in front of an X-ray device.
And they masturbated.
And Masters and Johnson looked to see if the semen was being sucked up.
Did not find any evidence of upsuck.
You may be wondering, "How do you make artificial semen?"
You can use flour and water, or cornstarch and water.
I actually found three separate recipes in the literature.
you know, they have the ingredients listed,
and then in a recipe it will say, for example,
"Yield: two dozen cupcakes."
This one said, "Yield: one ejaculate."
Sperm that sit around in the body for a week or more
start to develop abnormalities
Which I thought was an interesting idea, theory.
So now you have an evolutionary excuse.
pigs, for instance.
In Denmark, the Danish National Committee for Pig Production
And I got a copy of this DVD.
It all looks very innocent.
He's going to be doing things with his hands
that the boar would use his snout, lacking hands. Okay.
Why don't you have the farmers do that?
That's not one of your five steps."
just to get farmers to touch underneath the vulva.
So we thought, let's not mention the clitoris right now."
a sow vibrator,
that hangs on the sperm feeder tube to vibrate.
So possibly, you know, a little more arousing than it looks.
And I also said to her,
"Now, these sows. I mean, you may have noticed there.
And she said, you can't make that conclusion,
They use the upper half of the face; the ears are very expressive.
So you're not really sure what's going on with the pig.
This is the ejaculation face of the stump-tailed macaque.
but only when mounting another female.
from arousal, all the way through orgasm, in men and women --
everything that happens in the human body.
Okay, with women, a lot of this is happening inside.
This did not stop Masters and Johnson.
They developed an artificial coition machine.
This is basically a penis camera on a motor.
There is a phallus,
clear acrylic phallus, with a camera and a light source,
attached to a motor that is kind of going like this.
And the woman would have sex with it.
That is what they would do. Pretty amazing.
Sadly, this device has been dismantled.
Doctor Kinsey had heard --
and there was a theory going around at the time, this being the 1940s --
was a factor in fertility.
Kinsey thought it was bunk, so he got to work.
He got together in his lab
300 men, a measuring tape, and a movie camera.
the stuff just kind of slopped out.
It wasn't spurted or thrown or ejected under great force.
However, the record holder
Kinsey wrote,
"Two sheets were laid down to protect the oriental carpets."
My favorite being, "Cheese crumbs spread before a pair of copulating rats
will distract the female, but not the male."
I'll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior.
Not yours, of course -- other people's.
So I decided to try and write something more fun.
"Look, if you're serious about this,
you have to write about your research first; you have to publish something,
It's a fantastic time to write,
because there's so much feedback you can get from people.
People write to me about their personal experience,
and about their examples, and where they disagree,
and their nuances.
And even being here -- I mean, the last few days,
I've known heights of obsessive behavior
I never thought about.
and I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion
as a metaphor for rationality.
So think about these two tables.
And you must have seen this illusion.
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer?
No, right? It's impossible.
I can animate the lines.
aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it.
What color is the top arrow pointing to?
Very, very hard.
I can cover the rest of the cube up.
If I cover the rest of the cube, you can see that they are identical.
the illusion comes back.
There is no way for us not to see this illusion.
it might be that we actually make many more mistakes.
And worse -- not having an easy way to see them,
because in visual illusions, we can easily demonstrate the mistakes;
in cognitive illusion it's much, much harder
to demonstrate the mistakes to people.
or decision-making illusions, in the same way.
they would be interested in donating their organs.
These are different countries in Europe.
You basically see two types of countries:
countries on the right, that seem to be giving a lot;
or much less.
Giving organs to somebody else
is probably about how much you care about society, how linked you are.
Or maybe it's about religion.
But if you look at this plot,
you can see that countries that we think about as very similar,
actually exhibit very different behavior.
For example, Sweden is all the way on the right,
and Denmark, which we think is culturally very similar,
is all the way on the left.
Germany is on the left, and Austria is on the right.
The Netherlands is on the left, and Belgium is on the right.
And finally, depending on your particular version
of European similarity,
you can think about the U.K. and France as either similar culturally or not,
but it turns out that with organ donation, they are very different.
It turns out that they got to 28 percent
after mailing every household in the country a letter,
begging people to join this organ donation program.
You know, we wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions.
We wake up in the morning and we open the closet;
we feel that we decide what to wear.
we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat.
What this is actually saying,
that if you went to renew your license tomorrow,
and you went to the DMV,
and you encountered one of these forms,
that it would actually change your own behavior?
Very hard to think that it would influence us.
"These are decisions we don't care about."
In fact, by definition, these are decisions
than about something that happens after we die?
So a standard economist, somebody who believes in rationality,
than the possible benefit of the decision,
so that's why we get this effect."
It's not because it's trivial. It's not because we don't care.
It's the opposite. It's because we care.
It's difficult and it's complex.
And it's so complex that we don't know what to do.
And because we have no idea what to do,
we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us.
This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Shafir.
And they said, "Would this effect also happens to experts?
People who are well-paid, experts in their decisions,
and who make a lot of them?"
And they took a group of physicians.
that nothing is working for this patient.
All these medications, nothing seems to be working.
So you refer the patient for hip replacement therapy.
Hip replacement. Okay?"
So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced.
What do you do? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen?
Or do you let him go and have hip replacement?"
you didn't try out yet -- ibuprofen and piroxicam."
And if you pull him back, do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam? Which one?"
This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement,
What happens now?
The majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go
for a hip replacement.
I hope this worries you, by the way --
But the moment you set this as the default,
it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing.
Imagine I give you a choice:
or a weekend in Paris?
Now, weekend in Paris, weekend in Rome -- these are different things.
Imagine I said, "A weekend in Rome,
What if it was a trip to Rome, all expenses paid,
If you want coffee, you have to pay for it yourself, it's two euros 50.
given that you can have Rome with coffee,
why would you possibly want Rome without coffee?
It's like having your car stolen. It's an inferior option.
The fact that you have Rome without coffee
makes Rome with coffee look superior,
and not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris.
that gave us three choices:
an online subscription for 59 dollars,
a print subscription for 125 dollars,
or you could get both for 125.
And they passed me from one person to another to another,
until eventually I got to the person who was in charge of the website,
These are the market shares -- most people wanted the combo deal.
Thankfully, nobody wanted the dominant option.
That means our students can read.
you can take it off, right?
So I printed another version of this,
where I eliminated the middle option.
I gave it to another 100 students. Here is what happened:
Now the most popular option became the least popular,
and the least popular became the most popular.
in the middle, was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it.
In fact, relative to the option in the middle,
which was get only the print for 125,
And as a consequence, people chose it.
The general idea here, by the way,
People believe that when we deal with physical attraction,
This is why we have these four-minute dates.
So I decided to do this experiment with people.
I showed some people a picture of Tom, and a picture of Jerry.
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive.
And the question was, will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom
help their respective, more attractive brothers?
The answer was absolutely yes.
When ugly Jerry was around, Jerry was popular.
When ugly Tom was around, Tom was popular.
If you ever go bar-hopping, who do you want to take with you?
in fact, in medical terms,
The silver lining is, I think,
kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting.
we kind of understand our limitations.
We build steps.
And we build these things that not everybody can use, obviously.
and we build around them.
But for some reason, when it comes to the mental world,
when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stock markets,
we somehow forget the idea that we are limited.
Believe me or not, I come offering a solution
to a very important part of this larger problem,
with the requisite focus on climate.
And the solution I offer
is to the biggest culprit
in this massive mistreatment of the earth
by humankind,
and the resulting decline of the biosphere.
That culprit is business and industry,
which happens to be where I have spent the last 52 years
since my graduation from Georgia Tech in 1956.
As an industrial engineer,
cum aspiring and then successful entrepreneur.
After founding my company, Interface, from scratch
in 1973, 36 years ago,
to produce carpet tiles in America
for the business and institution markets,
and shepherding it through start-up and survival
to prosperity and global dominance in its field,
I read Paul Hawken's book,
"The Ecology of Commerce,"
the summer of 1994.
In his book, Paul charges business and industry
as, one, the major culprit
in causing the decline of the biosphere,
and, two, the only institution that is large enough,
and pervasive enough, and powerful enough,
to really lead humankind out of this mess.
And by the way he convicted me
as a plunderer of the earth.
which we defined as eventually operating
our petroleum-intensive company in such a way
as to take from the earth
not another fresh drop of oil --
and to do no harm to the biosphere.
Take nothing: do no harm.
I simply said, "If Hawken is right
and business and industry must lead,
who will lead business and industry?
Unless somebody leads, nobody will."
And thanks to the people of Interface,
I have become a recovering plunderer.
that someday people like me would go to jail.
And that became the headline of a Fortune article.
They went on to describe me as America's greenest CEO.
From plunderer to recovering plunderer,
to America's greenest CEO in five years --
that, frankly, was a pretty sad commentary
on American CEOs in 1999.
Asked later in the Canadian documentary, "The Corporation,"
what I meant by the "go to jail" remark,
I offered that theft is a crime.
And theft of our children's future would someday be a crime.
But I realized, for that to be true --
for theft of our children's future to be a crime --
there must be a clear, demonstrable alternative
to the take-make-waste industrial system
that so dominates our civilization,
and is the major culprit, stealing our children's future,
by digging up the earth
and converting it to products that quickly become waste
in a landfill or an incinerator --
in short, digging up the earth and converting it to pollution.
and a well-known environmental impact equation,
impact -- a bad thing --
is the product of population, affluence and technology.
That is, impact is generated by people,
what they consume in their affluence,
and how it is produced.
And though the equation is largely subjective,
you can perhaps quantify people, and perhaps quantify affluence,
but technology is abusive in too many ways to quantify.
So the equation is conceptual.
Still it works to help us understand the problem.
to create an example:
to transform the way we made carpet,
and to transform our technologies
so they diminished environmental impact,
rather than multiplied it.
Paul and Anne Ehrlich's environmental impact equation:
I is equal to P times A times T:
population, affluence and technology.
I wanted Interface to rewrite that equation so that it read
I equals P times A divided by T.
Now, the mathematically-minded will see immediately
that T in the numerator increases impact -- a bad thing --
but T in the denominator decreases impact.
So I ask, "What would move T, technology,
from the numerator -- call it T1 --
where it increases impact,
to the denominator -- call it T2 --
where it reduces impact?
of first industrial revolution,
T1, as we practiced it at Interface,
and it had the following characteristics.
Extractive: taking raw materials from the earth.
Linear: take, make, waste.
Powered by fossil fuel-derived energy.
Wasteful: abusive and focused on labor productivity.
More carpet per man-hour.
Thinking it through, I realized that all those attributes
must be changed to move T to the denominator.
linear by cyclical;
fossil fuel energy by renewable energy, sunlight;
wasteful by waste-free;
and abusive by benign;
and labor productivity by resource productivity.
and get rid of T1 altogether,
we could reduce our impact to zero,
including our impact on the climate.
And that became the Interface plan in 1995,
and has been the plan ever since.
So I can tell you how far we have come in the ensuing 12 years.
Net greenhouse gas emissions
down 82 percent in absolute tonnage.
(Applause)
Over the same span of time
sales have increased by two-thirds and profits have doubled.
So an 82 percent absolute reduction
translates into a 90 percent reduction
in greenhouse gas intensity relative to sales.
This is the magnitude
of the reduction the entire global technosphere
must realize by 2050
to avoid catastrophic climate disruption --
so the scientists are telling us.
Fossil fuel usage is down 60 percent per unit of production,
due to efficiencies in renewables.
The cheapest, most secure barrel of oil there is
is the one not used through efficiencies.
Water usage is down 75 percent
in our worldwide carpet tile business.
Down 40 percent in our broadloom carpet business,
which we acquired in 1993
right here in California, City of Industry,
where water is so precious.
Renewable energy is 27 percent of our total,
going for 100 percent.
We have diverted 148 million pounds --
that's 74,000 tons --
of used carpet from landfills,
closing the loop on material flows
through reverse logistics
and post-consumer recycling technologies
that did not exist when we started 14 years ago.
have contributed mightily to the fact that we have produced and sold
85 million square yards of climate-neutral carpet
since 2004,
meaning no net contribution to global climate disruption
in producing the carpet throughout the supply chain,
from mine and well head clear to end-of-life reclamation --
independent third-party certified.
We call it Cool Carpet.
And it has been a powerful marketplace differentiator,
increasing sales and profits.
Three years ago we launched carpet tile for the home,
under the brand Flor,
misspelled F-L-O-R.
You can point and click today at Flor.com
It is practical, and pretty too.
to our goal: zero impact, zero footprint.
We've set 2020 as our target year for zero,
for reaching the top, the summit of Mount Sustainability.
We call this Mission Zero.
And this is perhaps the most important facet:
we have found Mission Zero to be incredibly good for business.
A better business model,
a better way to bigger profits.
Here is the business case for sustainability.
From real life experience, costs are down, not up,
reflecting some 400 million dollars
of avoided costs in pursuit of zero waste --
the first face of Mount Sustainability.
This has paid all the costs for the transformation of Interface.
this false choice between the environment and the economy.
Our products are the best they've ever been,
inspired by design for sustainability,
an unexpected wellspring of innovation.
Our people are galvanized around this shared higher purpose.
You cannot beat it for attracting the best people
And the goodwill of the marketplace is astonishing.
No amount of advertising, no clever marketing campaign,
at any price, could have produced or created
this much goodwill.
Costs, products, people, marketplaces --
what else is there?
It is a better business model.
There is a dip there, from 2001 to 2003:
a dip when our sales, over a three-year period,
were down 17 percent.
But the marketplace was down 36 percent.
We literally gained market share.
We might not have survived that recession
but for the advantages of sustainability.
If every business were pursuing Interface plans,
would that solve all our problems?
I don't think so.
I remain troubled by the revised Ehrlich equation,
I equals P times A divided by T2.
That A is a capital A,
suggesting that affluence is an end in itself.
But what if we reframed Ehrlich further?
And what if we made A a lowercase 'a,'
suggesting that it is a means to an end,
and that end is happiness --
more happiness with less stuff.
(Applause) --
and our whole system of economics,
the sustainable species, living on a finite earth,
ethically, happily and ecologically
in balance with nature
and all her natural systems for a thousand generations,
or 10,000 generations --
that is to say, into the indefinite future.
But does the earth have to wait for our extinction as a species?
fully into existence by 2020.
We can see our way now,
clear to the top of that mountain.
And now the challenge is in execution.
And as my good friend and adviser Amory Lovins says,
"If something exists, it must be possible."
(Laughter)
If we can actually do it, it must be possible.
And if anybody can, it follows that everybody can.
leading humankind away from the abyss
because, with continued unchecked decline of the biosphere,
a very dear person is at risk here --
frankly, an unacceptable risk.
Who is that person?
Not you. Not I.
But let me introduce you to the one who is most at risk here.
On a Tuesday morning in March of 1996,
But about five days later back in Atlanta,
I received an email from Glenn Thomas,
one of my people in the California meeting.
He was sending me an original poem
that he had composed after our Tuesday morning together.
Because it told me, by God, one person got it.
Here is what Glenn wrote. And here is that person, most at risk.
Please meet "Tomorrow's Child."
I met you first last Tuesday morn.
And through his sobering point of view
For I never had an inkling
somehow threaten you.
will someday come and live here too."
"Tomorrow's Child" has spoken to me
with one simple but profound message,
which I presume to share with you.
We are, each and every one,
a part of the web of life.
And we have a choice to make
during our brief, brief visit
to this beautiful blue and green living planet:
to hurt it or to help it.
For you, it's your call.
♫ I think I'm ready to do my thing ♫
(Applause)
AIDS was discovered 1981; the virus, 1983.
These Gapminder bubbles show you
how the spread of the virus was in 1983 in the world,
or how we estimate that it was.
What we are showing here is --
on this axis here, I'm showing percent of infected adults.
And on this axis, I'm showing dollars per person in income.
And the size of these bubbles, the size of the bubbles here,
that shows how many are infected in each country,
and the color is the continent.
had a very low percentage infected,
but due to the big population, still a sizable bubble.
There were quite many people infected in the United States.
And, up there, you see Uganda.
They had almost five percent infected,
and quite a big bubble in spite of being a small country, then.
And they were probably the most infected country in the world.
Now, what has happened?
Now you have understood the graph
and now, in the next 60 seconds,
we will play the HIV epidemic in the world.
(Laughter)
I have solidified the beam of the laser pointer.
First, we have the fast rise in Uganda and Zimbabwe.
They went upwards like this.
In Asia, the first country to be heavily infected was Thailand --
they reached one to two percent.
Then, Uganda started to turn back,
whereas Zimbabwe skyrocketed,
and some years later South Africa had a terrible rise of HIV frequency.
Look, India got many infected,
but had a low level.
And almost the same happens here.
See, Uganda coming down, Zimbabwe coming down,
Russia went to one percent.
we have reached a steady state of HIV epidemic in the world.
25 years it took.
But, steady state doesn't mean that things are getting better,
it's just that they have stopped getting worse.
And it has -- the steady state is, more or less,
one percent of the adult world population is HIV-infected.
It means 30 to 40 million people,
the whole of California -- every person,
that's more or less what we have today in the world.
Botswana -- upper middle-income country in southern Africa,
democratic government, good economy,
and this is what happened there.
They started low, they skyrocketed,
they peaked up there in 2003,
and now they are down.
But they are falling only slowly,
because in Botswana, with good economy and governance,
they can manage to treat people.
And if people who are infected are treated, they don't die of AIDS.
These percentages won't come down
because people can survive 10 to 20 years.
So there's some problem with these metrics now.
But the poorer countries in Africa, the low-income countries down here,
there the rates fall faster, of the percentage infected,
because people still die.
In spite of PEPFAR, the generous PEPFAR,
all people are not reached by treatment,
and of those who are reached by treatment in the poor countries,
only 60 percent are left on treatment after two years.
It's not realistic with lifelong treatment
for everyone in the poorest countries.
But it's very good that what is done is being done.
It is only by stopping the transmission
that the world will be able to deal with it.
Drugs is too costly -- had we had the vaccine,
or when we will get the vaccine, that's something more effective --
but the drugs are very costly for the poor.
Not the drug in itself, but the treatment
and the care which is needed around it.
So, when we look at the pattern,
one thing comes out very clearly:
you see the blue bubbles
and people say HIV is very high in Africa.
I would say, HIV is very different in Africa.
You'll find the highest HIV rate in the world
in African countries,
and yet you'll find Senegal, down here --
the same rate as United States.
And you'll find Madagascar,
and you'll find a lot of African countries
about as low as the rest of the world.
It's this terrible simplification that there's one Africa
and things go on in one way in Africa.
We have to stop that.
It's not respectful, and it's not very clever
to think that way.
I found out that Salt Lake City and San Francisco were different.
(Laughter)
And so it is in Africa -- it's a lot of difference.
So, why is it so high? Is it war?
No, it's not. Look here.
War-torn Congo is down there -- two, three, four percent.
And this is peaceful Zambia, neighboring country -- 15 percent.
And there's good studies of the refugees coming out of Congo --
they have two, three percent infected,
and peaceful Zambia -- much higher.
There are now studies clearly showing
that the wars are terrible, that rapes are terrible,
but this is not the driving force for the high levels in Africa.
Well if you look at the macro level,
it seems more money, more HIV.
But that's very simplistic,
so let's go down and look at Tanzania.
I will split Tanzania in five income groups,
from the highest income to the lowest income,
and here we go.
The ones with the highest income, the better off -- I wouldn't say rich --
they have higher HIV.
The difference goes from 11 percent down to four percent,
and it is even bigger among women.
There's a lot of things that we thought, that now, good research,
done by African institutions and researchers
together with the international researchers, show that that's not the case.
So, this is the difference within Tanzania.
Look here at Kenya.
I've split Kenya in its provinces.
Here it goes.
See the difference within one African country --
it goes from very low level to very high level,
and most of the provinces in Kenya is quite modest.
Why do we see this extremely high levels in some countries?
Well, it is more common with multiple partners,
there is less condom use,
and there is age-disparate sex --
that is, older men tend to have sex with younger women.
We see higher rates in younger women than younger men
in many of these highly affected countries.
I will swap the bubbles to a map.
Look, the highly infected are four percent of all population
and they hold 50 percent of the HIV-infected.
HIV exists all over the world.
Look, you have bubbles all over the world here.
Brazil has many HIV-infected.
Arab countries not so much, but Iran is quite high.
They have heroin addiction and also prostitution in Iran.
India has many because they are many.
Southeast Asia, and so on.
But, there is one part of Africa --
and the difficult thing is, at the same time,
not to make a uniform statement about Africa,
not to come to simple ideas of why it is like this, on one hand.
because there is a scientific consensus about this pattern now.
UNAIDS have done good data available, finally,
about the spread of HIV.
It could be concurrency.
It could be some virus types.
It could be that there is other things
which makes transmission occur in a higher frequency.
After all, if you are completely healthy and you have heterosexual sex,
the risk of infection in one intercourse is one in 1,000.
Don't jump to conclusions now on how to
behave tonight and so on.
(Laughter)
But -- and if you are in an unfavorable situation,
more sexually transmitted diseases, it can be one in 100.
And what is concurrency?
In Sweden, we have no concurrency.
We have serial monogamy.
Vodka, New Year's Eve -- new partner for the spring.
Vodka, Midsummer's Eve -- new partner for the fall.
Vodka -- and it goes on like this, you know?
And you collect a big number of exes.
And we have a terrible chlamydia epidemic --
terrible chlamydia epidemic which sticks around for many years.
HIV has a peak three to six weeks after infection
and therefore, having more than one partner in the same month
is much more dangerous for HIV than others.
Probably, it's a combination of this.
towards fact when we look at this.
You can get this chart, free.
We have uploaded UNAIDS data on the Gapminder site.
And we hope that when we act on global problems in the future
we will not only have the heart,
we will not only have the money,
but we will also use the brain.
So sometimes I get invited to give weird talks.
I got invited to speak to the people
who dress up in big stuffed animal costumes
to perform at sporting events.
Unfortunately I couldn't go.
But it got me thinking about
the fact that these guys, at least most of them,
know what it is that they do for a living.
What they do is they dress up
as stuffed animals and entertain people at sporting events.
to speak at the convention of the people
who make balloon animals.
And again, I couldn't go. But it's a fascinating group. They make balloon animals.
There is a big schism between the ones who make
gospel animals and porn animals, but --
(Laughter)
they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons.
Sometimes they get in trouble, but not often.
And the other thing about these guys
is, they also know what they do for a living.
They make balloon animals.
What exactly to the people watching this do every day?
And I want to argue that what we do
is we try to change everything.
That we try to find a piece of the status quo --
something that bothers us, something that needs to be improved,
something that is itching to be changed -- and we change it.
We try to make big, permanent, important change.
But we don't think about it that way.
And we haven't spent a lot of time talking about
what that process is like.
And I've been studying it for a couple years.
And I want to share a couple stories with you today.
Nathan was the number two person at the San Francisco SPCA.
And what you may not know about the history of the SPCA
is, it was founded to kill dogs and cats.
Cities gave them a charter
to get rid of the stray animals on the street and destroy them.
In a typical year four million dogs and cats were killed,
most of them within 24 hours of being scooped off of the street.
Nathan and his boss saw this,
and they could not tolerate it.
So they set out to make San Francisco
a no-kill city:
create an entire city
where every dog and cat,
unless it was ill or dangerous,
would be adopted, not killed.
And everyone said it was impossible.
Nathan and his boss went to the city council to get a change in the ordinance.
And people from SPCAs and humane shelters around the country
flew to San Francisco
to testify against them --
to say it would hurt the movement and it was inhumane.
They persisted. And Nathan went directly to the community.
He connected with people who cared about this:
nonprofessionals, people with passion.
And within just a couple years,
San Francisco became the first no-kill city,
running no deficit, completely supported by the community.
Nathan left and went to Tompkins County, New York --
a place as different from San Francisco
as you can be and still be in the United States. And he did it again.
He went from being a glorified dogcatcher
to completely transforming the community.
And then he went to North Carolina and did it again.
And he went to Reno and he did it again.
and when I think about what people here do, I think about ideas.
And I think about the idea that
creating an idea, spreading an idea
has a lot behind it.
I don't know if you've ever been to a Jewish wedding,
but what they do is, they take a light bulb
and they smash it.
Now there is a bunch of reasons for that, and stories about it.
But one reason is because it indicates a change,
from before to after.
It is a moment in time.
And I want to argue that we are living through
and are right at the key moment
of a change in the way ideas are created
and spread and implemented.
that you could change the whole world if you had an efficient factory
that could churn out change.
We then went to the TV idea,
that said if you had a big enough mouthpiece,
if you could get on TV enough times, if you could buy enough ads, you could win.
And now we're in this new model of leadership,
where the way we make change
is not by using money
or power to lever a system,
but by leading.
Henry Ford comes up with a really cool idea.
It enables him to hire men
who used to get paid 50 cents a day
and pay them five dollars a day.
Because he's got an efficient enough factory.
Well with that sort of advantage
you can churn out a lot of cars.
You can make a lot of change. You can get roads built.
You can change the fabric of an entire country.
That the essence of what you're doing is you need
ever-cheaper labor,
and ever-faster machines.
And the problem we've run into is, we're running out of both.
Ever-cheaper labor and ever-faster machines.
(Laughter)
and say, "I know: television;
advertising. Push push.
Take a good idea and push it on the world.
I have a better mousetrap.
And if I can just get enough money to tell enough people, I'll sell enough."
And you can build an entire industry on that.
If necessary you can put babies in your ads.
If necessary you can use babies to sell other stuff.
And if babies don't work, you can use doctors.
But be careful.
Because you don't want to get an unfortunate juxtaposition,
where you're talking about one thing instead of the other.
(Laughter)
This model requires you to act like the king,
like the person in the front of the room
throwing things to the peons in the back.
That you are in charge, and you're going to tell people
what to do next.
The quick little diagram of it is, you're up here,
and you are pushing it out to the world.
This method -- mass marketing --
requires average ideas,
because you're going to the masses,
and plenty of ads.
What we've done as spammers
is tried to hypnotize everyone
into buying our idea,
hypnotize everyone into donating to our cause,
hypnotize everyone into voting for our candidate.
And, unfortunately, it doesn't work so well anymore either.
(Laughter)
I call it the idea of tribes.
What tribes are, is a very simple concept
that goes back 50,000 years.
It's about leading and connecting people and ideas.
And it's something that people have wanted forever.
Lots of people are used to having a spiritual tribe, or a church tribe,
having a work tribe,
having a community tribe.
But now, thanks to the internet, thanks to the explosion of mass media,
thanks to a lot of other things
that are bubbling through our society around the world,
tribes are everywhere.
Instead what it's allowed is silos of interest.
So you've got the red-hat ladies over here.
You've got the red-hat triathletes over there.
You've got the organized armies over here.
You've got the disorganized rebels over here.
You've got people in white hats making food.
And people in white hats sailing boats.
The point is that you can find Ukrainian folk dancers
and connect with them,
because you want to be connected.
That people on the fringes
can find each other, connect and go somewhere.
Every town that has a volunteer fire department
understands this way of thinking.
(Laughter)
this is a legitimate non-photoshopped photo.
People I know who are firemen told me that this is not uncommon.
And that what firemen do to train sometimes
is they take a house that is going to be torn down,
and they burn it down instead, and practice putting it out.
But they always stop and take a picture.
(Laughter)
They've got their own flag. They've got the eye patches.
You can tell when you're running into someone in a tribe.
And it turns out that it's tribes --
not money, not factories --
that can change our world, that can change politics,
that can align large numbers of people.
Not because you force them to do something against their will,
but because they wanted to connect.
all of us, I think,
is find something worth changing,
and then assemble tribes that assemble tribes
that spread the idea and spread the idea.
And it becomes something far bigger than ourselves,
it becomes a movement.
So when Al Gore set out
to change the world again,
he didn't do it by himself.
And he didn't do it by buying a lot of ads.
He did it by creating a movement.
Thousands of people around the country
who could give his presentation for him,
because he can't be in 100 or 200 or 500 cities in each night.
What Kevin Kelley has taught us is you just need,
I don't know, a thousand true fans --
a thousand people who care enough
that they will get you the next round
and the next round and the next round.
And that means that the idea you create, the product you create,
the movement you create isn't for everyone,
it's not a mass thing. That's not what this is about.
What it's about instead
is finding the true believers.
It's easy to look at what I've said so far,
and say, "Wait a minute, I don't have what it takes to be that kind of leader."
They're about the same age. But that's about it.
What they did, though, is each in their own way,
created a different way
of navigating your way through technology.
So some people will go out and get people to be on one team.
And some people will get people to be on the other team.
when you make products or services.
You know, this is one of my favorite devices.
But what a shame that it's not organized
to help authors create movements.
What would happen if, when you're using your Kindle,
you could see the comments and quotes and notes
from all the other people reading the same book as you in that moment.
Or from your book group. Or from your friends, or from the circle you want.
What would happen if authors, or people with ideas
could use version two, which comes out on Monday,
and use it to organize people
who want to talk about something.
Now there is a million things I could share with you about the mechanics here.
But let me just try a couple.
They merely decided to lead them.
That most movements, most leadership that we're doing
is about finding a group that's disconnected
but already has a yearning --
not persuading people to want something
they don't have yet.
her video that spread all across the internet
about the way farm animals are treated,
she didn't invent the idea of being a vegan.
She didn't invent the idea of caring about this issue.
But she helped organize people,
and helped turn it into a movement.
middle and lower class of Venezuela. He merely led them.
He just stepped up and said, "Follow me."
which allowed independent musicians
to have a place to sell their music without selling out to the man --
to have place to take the mission
they already wanted to go to, and connect with each other.
That heretics look at the status quo and say,
"This will not stand. I can't abide this status quo.
I am willing to stand up and be counted and move things forward.
I see what the status quo is; I don't like it."
That instead of looking at all the little rules
and following each one of them,
that instead of being what I call a sheepwalker --
somebody who's half asleep,
following instructions,
keeping their head down, fitting in --
every once in a while someone stands up and says, "Not me."
Someone stands up and says, "This one is important.
We need to organize around it."
And not everyone will. But you don't need everyone.
You just need a few people --
(Laughter) --
who will look at the rules,
realize they make no sense,
and realize how much they want to be connected.
Zappos isn't a shoe store.
Zappos is the one, the only,
the best-there-ever-was
place for people who are into shoes to find each other,
to talk about their passion,
to connect with people who care more
about customer service than making a nickel tomorrow.
It can be something as prosaic as shoes,
and something as complicated as overthrowing a government.
It's exactly the same behavior though.
is to be able to say, "I can't do this by myself.
But if I can get other people to join my Climb and Ride,
then together we can get something that we all want.
We're just waiting for someone to lead us."
new ways of thinking about environmental architecture.
She doesn't do it by quietly building one house at a time.
She does it by telling a story
to people who want to hear it.
By connecting a tribe of people
who are desperate to be connected to each other.
By leading a movement and
making change.
And around and around and around it goes.
The first one is, who exactly
are you upsetting?
Because if you're not upsetting anyone, you're not changing the status quo.
The second question is, who are you connecting?
Because for a lot of people, that's what they're in it for:
the connections that are being made, one to the other.
And the third one is, who are you leading?
Because focusing on that part of it --
not the mechanics of what you're building,
but the who, and the leading part -- is where change comes.
"What would happen if every time someone bought a pair of these shoes
I gave exactly the same pair to someone
who doesn't even own a pair of shoes?"
This is not the story of how you get shelf space at Neiman Marcus.
It's a story of a product that tells a story.
And as you walk around with this remarkable pair of shoes
and someone says, "What are those?"
You get to tell the story on Blake's behalf,
on behalf of the people who got the shoes.
And suddenly it's not one pair of shoes or 100 pairs of shoes.
It's tens of thousands of pairs of shoes.
fighting against juvenile diabetes.
Not fighting the organization that's fighting it -- fighting with them, leading them,
connecting them, challenging the status quo
because it's important to him.
And the people he surrounds himself with need the connection.
They need the leadership. It makes a difference.
But in case you do, here it is:
they're waiting, we're waiting
for you to show us where to go next.
So here is what leaders have in common. The first thing is, they challenge
the status quo.
They challenge what's currently there.
The second thing is, they build a culture.
A secret language, a seven-second handshake,
a way of knowing that you're in or out.
They have curiosity. Curiosity about people in the tribe,
curiosity about outsiders. They're asking questions.
They connect people to one another.
Do you know what people want more than anything?
They want to be missed.
They want to be missed the day they don't show up.
They want to be missed when they're gone.
And tribe leaders can do that.
It's fascinating, because all tribe leaders have charisma,
but you don't need charisma to become a leader.
Being a leader gives you charisma.
If you look and study the leaders who have succeeded,
that's where charisma comes from -- from the leading.
Finally, they commit.
They commit to the cause. They commit to the tribe.
They commit to the people who are there.
And I hope you'll think about it before you reject it out-of-hand.
What I want you to do, it only takes 24 hours,
is: create a movement.
Something that matters. Start. Do it. We need it.
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.
(Applause)
I'm not at all a cook.
So don't fear, this is not going to be a cooking demonstration.
But I do want to talk to you about something
that I think is dear to all of us.
And that is bread -- something which is as simple
as our basic, most fundamental human staple.
And I think few of us spend the day
without eating bread in some form.
Unless you're on one of these Californian low-carb diets,
bread is standard.
Bread is not only standard in the Western diet.
As I will show to you, it is actually
the mainstay of modern life.
In the meantime I'm also talking to you,
so my life is going to be complicated. Bear with me.
First of all, a little bit of audience participation.
I have two loaves of bread here.
One is a supermarket standard:
white bread, pre-packaged,
which I'm told is called a Wonderbread.
(Laughter)
I didn't know this word until I arrived.
And this is more or less,
a whole-meal, handmade,
small-bakery loaf of bread.
Here we go. I want to see a show of hands.
Who prefers the whole-meal bread?
Okay let me do this differently. Is anybody preferring the Wonderbread at all?
(Laughter)
I have two tentative male hands.
(Laughter)
why is this so?
And I think it is because
we feel that this kind of bread
really is about authenticity.
It's about a traditional way of living.
A way that is perhaps more real, more honest.
This is an image from Tuscany, where we feel
agriculture is still about beauty.
And life is really, too.
And this is about good taste, good traditions.
Why do we have this image?
Why do we feel that this is more true than this?
Well I think it has a lot to do with our history.
In the 10,000 years since agriculture evolved,
most of our ancestors have actually been agriculturalists
or they were closely related to food production.
And we have this mythical image
of how life was in rural areas in the past.
Art has helped us to maintain that kind of image.
It was a mythical past.
Of course, the reality is quite different.
These poor farmers
working the land by hand or with their animals,
had yield levels that are comparable
to the poorest farmers today in West Africa.
But we have, somehow,
in the course of the last few centuries, or even decades,
started to cultivate an image of
a mythical, rural agricultural past.
that we had the advent of the Industrial Revolution.
And while I'm starting to make some bread for you here,
it's very important to understand
what that revolution did to us.
It brought us power. It brought us mechanization, fertilizers.
And it actually drove up our yields.
And even sort of horrible things, like picking beans by hand,
can now be done automatically.
All that is a real, great improvement, as we shall see.
Of course we also, particularly in the last decade,
managed to envelop the world
in a dense chain of supermarkets,
in a chain of global trade.
And it means that you now eat products,
which can come from all around the world.
That is the reality of our modern life.
Now you may prefer this loaf of bread.
Excuse my hands but this is how it is.
historically, is this white Wonder loaf.
And don't despise the white bread
because it really, I think,
symbolizes the fact that bread and food
have become plentiful and affordable to all.
And that is a feat that we
are not really conscious of that much.
But it has changed the world.
This tiny bread that is tasteless in some ways
and has a lot of problems
has changed the world.
So what is happening?
Well the best way to look at that is to do a tiny bit of simplistic statistics.
With the advent of the Industrial Revolution
with modernization of agriculture
in the last few decades, since the 1960s,
food availability, per head, in this world,
has increased by 25 percent.
And the world population in the meantime has doubled.
That means that we have now more food available
than ever before in human history.
And that is the result, directly,
of being so successful
at increasing the scale and volume of our production.
And this is true, as you can see, for all countries,
including the so-called developing countries.
As food became plentiful here,
it also meant that we were able to decrease
the number of people working in agriculture
to something like, on average, in the high income countries,
five percent or less of the population.
In the U.S. only one percent of the people are actually farmers.
And it frees us all up to do other things --
to sit at TED meetings and not to worry about our food.
That is, historically, a really unique situation.
Never before has the responsibility to feed the world
been in the hands of so few people.
And never before have so many people
been oblivious of that fact.
And as it became cheaper, bread manufacturers decided to add in all kinds of things.
We added in more sugar.
We add in raisins and oil and milk
and all kinds of things to make bread,
from a simple food into kind of a support for calories.
And today, bread now is associated with obesity,
which is very strange.
It is the basic, most fundamental food
that we've had in the last ten thousand years.
Wheat is the most important crop -- the first crop we domesticated
and the most important crop we still grow today.
of high calories.
And that's not only true in this country,
it is true all over the world.
Bread has migrated to tropical countries,
where the middle classes now eat French rolls and hamburgers
and where the commuters
find bread much more handy to use
than rice or cassava.
So bread has become from a main staple,
a source of calories
associated with obesity
and also a source of modernity,
of modern life.
And the whiter the bread, in many countries, the better it is.
But of course the price of mass production
has been that we moved large-scale.
And large-scale has meant destruction of many of our landscapes,
destruction of biodiversity --
still a lonely emu here
in the Brazilian cerrado soybean fields.
The costs have been tremendous --
water pollution, all the things you know about, destruction of our habitats.
And this is where I have to query all of you.
How many of you can actually tell wheat apart from other cereals?
How many of you actually can make a bread
in this way, without starting with a bread machine
or just some kind of packaged flavor?
Can you actually bake bread? Do you know how much a loaf of bread actually costs?
We have become very removed
from what our bread really is,
which, again, evolutionarily speaking,
is very strange.
In fact not many of you know that
our bread, of course, was not a European invention.
It was invented by farmers in Iraq
and Syria in particular.
The tiny spike on the left to the center
is actually the forefather of wheat.
This is where it all comes from,
and where these farmers who actually, ten thousand years ago,
put us on the road of bread.
that with this massification and large-scale production,
there is a counter-movement that emerged --
very much also here in California.
The counter-movement says, "Let's go back to this.
Let's go back to traditional farming.
Let's go back to small-scale, to farmers' markets,
small bakeries and all that." Wonderful.
Don't we all agree? I certainly agree.
I would love to go back to Tuscany
to this kind of traditional setting,
gastronomy, good food.
But this is a fallacy.
And the fallacy comes from idealizing
a past that we have forgotten about.
we are going, actually, to relegate
these poor farmers and their husbands --
among whom I have lived for many years,
working without electricity and water, to try to improve their food production --
we relegate them to poverty.
What they want are implements
to increase their production:
something to fertilize the soil,
something to protect their crop and to bring it to a market.
We cannot just think that small-scale
is the solution to the world food problem.
It's a luxury solution for us who can afford it,
if you want to afford it.
In fact we do not want this poor woman
to work the land like this.
If we say just small-scale production,
as is the tendency here,
to go back to local food means that a poor man like Hans Rosling
cannot even eat oranges anymore
because in Scandinavia we don't have oranges.
So local food production is out.
But also we do not want
to relegate to poverty in the rural areas.
And we do not want to relegate
the urban poor to starvation.
So we must find other solutions.
needs to increase very rapidly --
doubling by about 2030.
The main driver of that is actually meat.
And meat consumption in Southeast Asia and China in particular
is what drives the prices of cereals.
That need for animal protein is going to continue.
We can discuss alternatives in another talk, perhaps one day,
but this is our driving force.
So what can we do?
Can we find a solution to produce more?
Yes. But we need mechanization.
And I'm making a real plea here.
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer
to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice,
150,000 times, just to plant a crop and weed it.
You cannot ask people to work under these conditions.
We need clever low-key mechanization
that avoids the problems of the large-scale mechanization that we've had.
We must feed three billion people in cities.
We will not do that through small farmers' markets
because these people have no small farmers' markets at their disposal.
They have low incomes. And they benefit
from cheap, affordable, safe and diverse food.
That's what we must aim for in the next 20 to 30 years.
And let me just do one simple conceptual thing:
if I plot science as a proxy
for control of the production process and scale.
What you see is that we've started
in the left-hand corner with traditional agriculture,
which was sort of small-scale and low-control.
We've moved towards large-scale and very high control.
What I want us to do is to keep up the science and even get more science in there
but go to a kind of regional scale --
not just in terms of the scale of the fields,
but in terms of the entire food network.
That's where we should move.
And the ultimate may be, but it doesn't apply to cereals,
that we have entirely closed ecosystems --
the horticultural systems right at the top left-hand corner.
So we need to think differently about agriculture science.
Agriculture science for most people -- and there are not many farmers
among you here --
has this name of being bad,
of being about pollution, about large-scale,
about the destruction of the environment.
That is not necessary.
We need more science and not less. And we need good science.
Well first of all I think
we can do much better on the existing technologies.
Use biotechnology where useful,
particularly in pest and disease resistance.
There are also robots, for example,
who can recognize weeds
with a resolution of half an inch.
We have much cleverer irrigation.
We do not need to spill the water if we don't want to.
And we need to think very dispassionately
about the comparative advantages
of small-scale and large-scale.
We need to think that land is multi-functional.
It has different functions.
There are different ways in which we must use it --
for residential, for nature, for agriculture purposes.
And we also need to re-examine livestock.
Go regional and go to urban food systems.
I want to see fish ponds in parking lots and basements.
I want to have horticulture
and greenhouses on top of residential areas.
And I want to use the energy that comes from those greenhouses
and from the fermentation of crops
to heat our residential areas.
There are all kinds of ways we can do it.
We cannot solve the world food problem
by using biological agriculture.
But we can do a lot more.
as you go back to your countries, or as you stay here:
ask your government for an integrated food policy.
Food is as important as energy,
as security, as the environment.
Everything is linked together.
So we can do that. In fact in a densely populated country
like the River Delta, where I live in the Netherlands,
we have combined these functions.
So this is not science fiction. We can combine things
even in a social sense of making
the rural areas more accessible to people --
to house, for example, the chronically sick.
There is all kinds of things we can do.
"Let's get more bold science into agriculture."
You must go back
and think about your own food chain.
Talk to farmers. When was the last time
you went to a farm and talked to a farmer?
Talk to people in restaurants.
Understand where you are in the food chain,
where your food comes from.
Understand that you are part
of this enormous chain of events.
And that frees you up to do other things.
And above all, to me, food is about respect.
It's about understanding, when you eat,
that there are also many people who are still in this situation,
who are still struggling for their daily food.
And the kind of simplistic solutions that we sometimes have,
to think that doing everything by hand
is going to be the solution,
is really not morally justified.
We need to help to lift them out of poverty.
We need to make them proud of being a farmer
because they allow us to survive.
Never before, as I said,
has the responsibility for food
been in the hands of so few.
And never before have we had the luxury
of taking it for granted
because it is now so cheap.
better, to me, the idea that food, in the end,
in our own tradition, is something holy.
It's not about nutrients and calories.
It's about sharing. It's about honesty. It's about identity.
Who said this so beautifully was Mahatma Gandhi,
75 years ago, when he spoke about bread.
He did not speak about rice, in India. He said,
"To those who have to go without two meals a day,
God can only appear as bread."
and I've been baking it, and I'll try not to burn my hands.
Let me share
with those of you here in the first row.
Let me share some of the food with you.
Take some of my bread.
And as you eat it, and as you try it --
please come and stand up.
Have some of it.
I want you to think that every bite connects you
to the past and the future:
to these anonymous farmers,
that first bred the first wheat varieties;
and to the farmers of today,
who've been making this. And you don't even know who they are.
Every meal you eat
contains ingredients from all across the world.
Everything makes us so privileged,
that we can eat this food, that we don't struggle every day.
And that, I think,
evolutionarily-speaking is unique.
We've never had that before.
So enjoy your bread.
Eat it, and feel privileged.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Last year I showed these two slides so that
demonstrate that the arctic ice cap,
which for most of the last three million years
has been the size of the lower 48 states,
has shrunk by 40 percent.
But this understates the seriousness of this particular problem
because it doesn't show the thickness of the ice.
The arctic ice cap is, in a sense,
the beating heart of the global climate system.
It expands in winter and contracts in summer.
The next slide I show you will be
a rapid fast-forward of what's happened over the last 25 years.
The permanent ice is marked in red.
As you see, it expands to the dark blue --
that's the annual ice in winter,
and it contracts in summer.
The so-called permanent ice, five years old or older,
you can see is almost like blood,
spilling out of the body here.
In 25 years it's gone from this, to this.
heats up the frozen ground around the Arctic Ocean,
where there is a massive amount of frozen carbon
which, when it thaws, is turned into methane by microbes.
Compared to the total amount of global warming pollution in the atmosphere,
that amount could double if we cross this tipping point.
Already in some shallow lakes in Alaska,
methane is actively bubbling up out of the water.
Professor Katey Walter from the University of Alaska
went out with another team to another shallow lake last winter.
Video: Whoa! (Laughter)
Al Gore: She's okay. The question is whether we will be.
heats up Greenland from the north.
This is an annual melting river.
But the volumes are much larger than ever.
This is the Kangerlussuaq River in southwest Greenland.
If you want to know how sea level rises
from land-base ice melting
this is where it reaches the sea.
These flows are increasing very rapidly.
At the other end of the planet, Antarctica
the largest mass of ice on the planet.
Last month scientists reported the entire continent
is now in negative ice balance.
And west Antarctica cropped up on top some under-sea islands,
is particularly rapid in its melting.
That's equal to 20 feet of sea level, as is Greenland.
at the top you see new lakes, which a few years ago were glaciers.
40 percent of all the people in the world
get half of their drinking water from that melting flow.
In the Andes, this glacier is the
source of drinking water for this city.
The flows have increased.
But when they go away, so does much of the drinking water.
In California there has been a 40 percent
decline in the Sierra snowpack.
This is hitting the reservoirs.
And the predictions, as you've read, are serious.
a dramatic increase in fires.
And the disasters around the world
have been increasing at an absolutely extraordinary
and unprecedented rate.
Four times as many in the last 30 years
as in the previous 75.
This is a completely unsustainable pattern.
If you look at in the context of history
you can see what this is doing.
we've added 70 million tons of CO2
every 24 hours --
25 million tons every day to the oceans.
Look carefully at the area of the eastern Pacific,
from the Americas, extending westward,
and on either side of the Indian subcontinent,
where there is a radical depletion of oxygen in the oceans.
The biggest single cause of global warming,
along with deforestation, which is 20 percent of it, is the burning of fossil fuels.
Oil is a problem, and coal is the most serious problem.
The United States is one of the two
largest emitters, along with China.
And the proposal has been to build a lot more coal plants.
Here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years
with some green alternatives proposed.
(Applause)
However there is a political battle
in our country.
And the coal industries and the oil industries
spent a quarter of a billion dollars in the last calendar year
promoting clean coal,
which is an oxymoron.
That image reminded me of something.
(Laughter)
Around Christmas, in my home in Tennessee,
a billion gallons of coal sludge was spilled.
You probably saw it on the news.
This, all over the country, is the second largest waste stream in America.
This happened around Christmas.
One of the coal industry's ads around Christmas was this one.
He's abundant here in America,
and he helps our economy grow.
Frosty the coal man is getting cleaner everyday.
He's affordable and adorable, and workers keep their pay.
The largest mountaintop miner is the head of Massey Coal.
Nancy Pelosi, Harry Reid, they don't know what they're talking about.
has launched two campaigns.
This is one of them, part of one of them.
threat to our business.
That's why we've made it our primary goal
to spend a large sum of money
on an advertising effort to help bring out and complicate
the truth about coal.
The fact is, coal isn't dirty.
We think it's clean --
smells good, too.
So don't worry about climate change.
Leave that up to us.
(Laughter)
So let's take a tour of this state-of-the-art clean coal facility.
Amazing! The machinery is kind of loud.
But that's the sound of clean coal technology.
And while burning coal is one of the leading causes of global warming,
the remarkable clean coal technology you see here
changes everything.
Take a good long look: this is today's clean coal technology.
meshes with our economic challenge
and our national security challenge.
national security, the climate crisis.
The thread that links them all:
our addiction to carbon based fuels,
like dirty coal and foreign oil.
But now there is a bold new solution to get us out of this mess.
Repower America with 100 percent clean electricity
within 10 years.
A plan to put America back to work,
make us more secure, and help stop global warming.
Finally, a solution that's big enough to solve our problems.
Repower America. Find out more.
One of the fastest ways to cut our dependence
on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet.
Man: Future's over here. Wind, sun, a new energy grid.
Man #2: New investments to create high-paying jobs.
Narrator: Repower America. It's time to get real.
"If you want to go quickly, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together."
We need to go far, quickly.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This is a sculpture I made,
which is a way of, kind of, freeing a form
into an object that has different degrees of freedom.
So, it can balance on a point.
This is a bronze ball,
an aluminum arm here,
and then this wooden disk.
And the wooden disk was really thought about
as something that you'd want to hold on to,
and that would glide easily through your hands.
The aluminum is because it's very light.
The bronze is nice hard, durable material
that could roll on the ground.
Inside of the bronze ball
there's a lead weight
that is free-swinging on an axle
that's on two bearings
that pass in between, across it,
like this, that counterbalance this weight.
So it allows it to roll.
And the sphere has that balance property
that it always sort of stays still
and looks the same from every direction.
But if you put something on top of it,
it disbalances it. And so it would tip over.
But in this case because
the interior is free-swinging
in relation to the sphere,
it can stand up on one point.
And then there was a second level to this object,
which is that it --
I wanted it to convey some proportions that I was interested in,
which is the diameter of the Moon
and the diameter of the Earth
in proportion to each other.
wanting to make things float in the air.
And I thought up a lot of ideas.
This is sculpture that I made that --
it's magnetically levitated.
The thing is, is that it's slightly dangerous.
Normally it's sort of cordoned off when it's in a museum.
But it's uh -- let's see if I can manipulate it a little bit
without, um -- oops.
So this is just floating,
floating on a permanent magnetic field,
which stabilizes it in all directions.
Except there is a slight tether here,
which keeps it from going over the top of its field.
It's sort of surfing on a magnetic field
at the crest of a wave.
And that's what supports the object and keeps it stable.
I have a sort of a collection of videos
that I took of different installations, which I could narrate.
This is a sculpture of the Sun
and the Earth, in proportion.
Representing that eight and a half minutes
that it takes light and gravity to connect the two.
So here is the Earth. It's a little less than a millimeter
that was turned of solid bronze.
That's the Sun at that end.
And then in a series of 55 balls,
it reduces, proportionately -- each ball
and the spaces between them
reduce proportionately,
until they get down to this little Earth.
This is in a sculpture park in Taejon.
and then the distance to the Earth, in proportion also.
This is a little stone ball, floating.
As you can see the little tether,
that it's also magnetically levitated.
this is 109 spheres,
since the Sun is 109 times the diameter of the Earth.
And so this is the size of the Sun.
And then each of these little spheres
is the size of the Earth in proportion to the Sun.
It's made up of 16 concentric shells. Each one has 92 spheres.
This is in the courtyard of a twelfth-century alchemist.
I was thinking that the Sun is kind of the ultimate alchemist. (Laughter)
a slice from the equator of the Earth.
And then the Moon in the center,
and it's floating. And this is in France.
It's balancing on a shaft and a ball,
right at the center of gravity, or just slightly above the center of gravity,
which means that the lower half of the object
is just a little bit more weighty.
So you can see it rotating here.
It weighs about a ton or over a ton.
It's made of stainless steel, quite thick.
But it's being balanced like that in equilibrium.
It's susceptible to motion by the air currents.
These are these arrays. These spheres are all suspended,
but they have magnets horizontally in them
that make them all like compasses.
So all the red sides, for example, face one direction: south.
And the blue side, the compliment, faces the other way.
So as you turn around you're seeing different colors.
It was a diamond cell structure
was the point of departure.
And then there were kind of large spaces in the hollows
between the atoms.
And so I placed one more element of each one of them.
These were white spheres.
Then I had video projectors
that were projecting intermittently onto the spheres.
So they would catch parts of the images,
and make sort of three-dimensional color volumes,
as you walk through it, through the object.
of a tactile communication system.
It was the idea of isolating the tactile component of sculpture,
and then putting it into a communication system.
This is an idea of moving a sculpture, a ball,
that would be directed around the room
by a computer.
It has Buckminster Fuller's Dymaxion Map edited here.
It turns once per day in synchrony with the Earth.
projects that are harder to build.
(Laughter)
This has a diamond-bottomed lake.
So it's a floating island
with water, fresh water,
that can fly from place to place.
This would be grown, I suppose,
with nanotechnology in the future sometime.
I sort of have a broad range of interests.
And some of it is just the idea of creating media --
media as a sculpture,
something that would keep the sculpture
fresh and ever-changing,
by just creating the media that the sculpture is made of.
And I had a lot of --
always interested in the concept of a crystal ball.
And the idea that you could see things
inside of a crystal ball and predict the future --
or a television set, where it's sort of like a magic box
where anything can appear.
I had thought about, a long time ago,
in the late '60s -- when I was just starting out,
I was under the influence of thinking about Buckminster Fuller's
grand project for an electric globe
across from the United Nations --
and other things that were happening,
the space program at that time,
and Whole Earth Catalog, things like that.
I was thinking about mass produced spherical television sets
that could be linked to orbiting camera satellites.
This has evolved over the years
in a lot of different iterations.
But this the current version of it,
is a flying airship
that is about 35 meters in diameter,
about 110 feet in diameter.
The whole surface of it is covered with 60 million diodes,
red, blue, and green,
that allow you to have a high-resolution picture, visible in daylight.
I brought it to Paul MacCready's company AeroVironment
to do a feasibility study,
and they analyzed it,
and came up with a lot of innovative ideas about how to propel it.
So we have a physical plan of how to make this actually happen.
This is the control room inside of the ship.
The idea of this air genie is,
it's something that can just transform and become anything.
It's like a traveling show.
It has speakers on it. And it has cameras
over the surface of it.
So it can see its environment,
and then it can mimic its environment and disappear.
Here the legs are retracting.
The cabin is open or closed, as you like.
It weighs about 20 tons.
It has on-board generators.
It can generate about a million kilowatts,
in order to be bright enough
to be visible in daylight.
The idea of it is to make a kind of a traveling show.
It really would be dedicated to the arts and to interacting.
There would be on board a crew of artists, musicians,
that would allow the thing to become
actually kind of a conscious object
that would respond to the moment,
and to interact as an entity
that was aware, that could communicate.
It's completely silent and nonpolluting.
It has electric motors with a novel propulsion system.
It could be interacted with large crowds in different ways.
how it would interact with, say,
going to a college campus,
and then being used as a way of talking about the earth sciences,
the world, the situation of the globe.
The default image on the object
would probably be a high-resolution Earth image.
But then one could interact with that
and show plate tectonics or global warming issues, or migrations --
all of the things that we're concerned with today.
it would be used as kind of a rave situation,
where the people could cut loose,
and the music and the lights, and everything.
So it could land in a park, for example.
Or this could represent a college green.
And then it would have a corresponding website
that would show the itinerary of this.
And so interacting with the same kind of imagery.
It would also be able to be an open code,
so people could interact with it.
It would be forum for people's ideas about
what they would like to see on a giant screen of this type.
So that's pretty much it.
Okay. Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,
and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.
But as a physicist,
I thought, well if you give me some data,
I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.
I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.
Can you get me some information?
(Laughter)
No. So I had to think a little harder.
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.
And I saw that there was information there.
There was data within the streams of news that we consume.
All this noise around us actually has information.
So what I started thinking was,
perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.
If we can get enough of these streams of information together,
we can perhaps start to understand the war.
an interdisciplinary team of scientists,
of economists, mathematicians.
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.
We did it in three steps.
The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information --
from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.
That database contained
the timing of attacks,
the location, the size and the weapons used.
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily,
we just have to know how to pull it out.
And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?
What would that tell us?
on the horizontal axis
you've got the number of people killed in an attack
or the size of the attack.
And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.
So we plot data for sample on this.
You see some sort of random distribution --
perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,
or 47 attacks where seven people were killed.
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.
And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.
You take all of the conflict,
all of the chaos, all of the noise,
and out of that
comes this precise mathematical distribution
of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.
This blew our mind.
Why should a conflict like Iraq have this
as its fundamental signature?
Why should there be order in war?
We didn't really understand that.
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.
So we looked at a few more conflicts.
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,
and we looked at Senegal.
This wasn't supposed to happen.
These are different wars, with different religious factions,
different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them
are the same.
So we went a little wider.
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.
From Peru to Indonesia,
we studied this same pattern again.
And we found that not only
were the distributions these straight lines,
but the slope of these lines, they clustered around
this value of alpha equals 2.5.
And we could generate an equation
that could predict the likelihood of an attack.
What we're saying here
is the probability of an attack killing X number of people
in a country like Iraq
is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,
raised to the power of negative alpha.
And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.
This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists.
How do we explain this?
And what we really found was that alpha,
if we think about it, is the organizational
structure of the insurgency.
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,
which is really the distribution
of the group strength carrying out the attacks.
So we look at a process of group dynamics:
coalescence and fragmentation,
groups coming together, groups breaking apart.
And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?
Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing
in places like Iraq?
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.
We can run these simulations.
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics
to explain the patterns that we see
all around the conflicts around the world.
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts
have the same patterns?
Now what I believe is going on is that
the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.
And it turns out there is only one solution
to fight a much stronger enemy.
And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,
you don't exist.
So every insurgent force that is ongoing,
every conflict that is ongoing,
it's going to look something like this.
And that is what we think is happening.
How do we end a war like Iraq?
What does it look like?
Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.
This is what wars look like when they continue.
We've got to change that.
We can push it up:
the forces become more fragmented;
there is more of them, but they are weaker.
Or we push it down:
they're more robust; there is less groups;
but perhaps you can sit and talk to them.
No one has seen this before. This is literally
stuff that we've come through last week.
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.
We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state
the wars around the world look like.
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah
until the Samarra bombings in the
Iraqi elections of '06.
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards
to a fragmented state.
This is when the surge happens.
And depending on who you ask,
the surge was supposed to push it up even further.
The opposite happened.
The groups became stronger.
They became more robust.
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.
It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.
And this tells me one of two things.
Either we're back where we started
and the surge has had no effect;
or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent
that we can start to think about maybe moving out.
I don't know what the answer is to that.
But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency
to answer that question.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'd like to begin this song I wrote
about ceaseless yearning and never-ending want
with a poem of popular Petrarchan paradoxes
by Sir Thomas Wyatt the Elder:
"I find no peace, and all my war is done;
I fear and hope, I burn and freeze like ice;
I fly above the wind,
and yet I cannot arise;
And naught I have,
and all the world I seize upon."
Thomas Dolby: For pure pleasure
please welcome the lovely,
the delectable,
and the bilingual Rachelle Garniez.
♫ Picture yourself in a world where there's no one else, ♫
because I think it's difficult to be in the world
and not be aware of what's going on,
and the wars and so forth.
This song kind of came out of all of that.
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,
which I still stand by,
but this has got something else in it.
It's called "Peace on Earth."
(Applause)
and I'm really glad that I stayed here and listened
because I've really been inspired.
And I'm going to play some songs for you tonight
that are, literally, world premieres.
I've been working on my new record
and I've never played these songs for anybody
except the microphone.
about the meaning of technology,
which goes perfectly with this gathering.
I started thinking about -- when I was in college,
especially as a blind person,
doing a research paper was a major undertaking.
You had to go to the library,
see if you could get them to find the books for you,
you know, footnotes and all that.
Now you can just go on Google. Just look it up.
I wish I had that when I was in college.
Anyway, this is a song about:
we have all this, but what are we going to do with it?
It's called "All the Answers."
Whew! It's a miracle I didn't make any mistakes on that song.
That's the first time I've ever played it.
(Applause)
It's a "feel the fear and do it anyway" kind of thing.
This next song is a song
It was one of the titles
that I was sort of thinking about calling my record,
except there's a couple of problems.
One thing is, it's unpronounceable.
And it's a made-up word.
It's called "Tembererana."
And the song is based on
what I think was my first
childhood attempts
to think about invisible forces.
So "tembererana" was these dreams,
in which I would be running away
from bad feelings -- is the only way I can put it.
So this is called "Tembererana."
It's based on an Argentinian rhythm
called "carnivalito."
♫ Like the heather ♫
This song is one of Thomas' favorites,
called "What You Do with What You've Got."
This is about a place in London
called Kiteflyer's Hill
where I used to go and spend hours
going "When is he coming back? When is he coming back?"
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I've got over.
But this is "Kiteflyer's Hill."
It's a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan,
actually, for me.
thank you very much for inviting me. It's been a blessing singing for you.
Thank you very much.
Ladies and gentlemen,
the history of music and television on the Internet
in three minutes.
A TED medley --
a TEDley.
a tribute to the Recording Industry Association of America --
the RIAA!
Thank you very much.
Now, I've got a story for you.
When I arrived off the plane,
after a very long journey from the West of England,
my computer, my beloved laptop,
had gone mad,
and had -- oh! -- a bit like that! --
and the display on it --
anyway, the whole thing had burst.
And I went to the IT guys here
and a gentleman mended my computer,
and then he said, "What are you doing here?"
and I said "I'm playing the cello and I'm doing a bit of singing,"
and he said, "Oh, I sort of play the cello as well."
And I said, "Do you really?"
Anyway, so you're in for a treat,
because he's fantastic, and his name's Mark.
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.
And I promised to come back and give you an update
on how that machine worked.
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --
27 kilometers in circumference.
Its job is to recreate the conditions
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,
up to 600 million times a second.
It's nothing if not ambitious.
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction
so you can see the scale.
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.
It caused immense celebration in the control room.
It's a picture of the first beam particle
going all the way around the LHC,
colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,
and showering particles into the detector.
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th
we knew the machine worked,
which is a great triumph.
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,
or this, when someone went onto Google
and saw the front page was like that.
It means we made cultural impact
as well as scientific impact.
related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps
when the machine is working in full power.
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,
"No they don't. They're small wires."
They can do that because
when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.
So at minus 271 degrees,
colder than the space between the stars,
those wires can take that current.
there was a manufacturing defect.
So the wire heated up slightly,
and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.
This was the result.
Now that's more impressive
when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,
and they moved about a foot.
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.
We had to take them out, which we did.
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.
They're all on their way back underground now.
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.
We will switch it on,
and we expect to take data in June or July,
and continue with our quest to find out
what the building blocks of the universe are.
those accidents reignite the debate
about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.
I think that the fact that it's so difficult,
the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,
who, I suspect,
when defending his protege's useless experiments --
his protege was Michael Faraday --
said this, "Nothing is so dangerous
to the progress of the human mind
than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,
that there are no mysteries in nature,
that our triumphs are complete, and that
there are no new worlds to conquer."
Thank you.
(Applause)
So the first question is, why do we need to
even worry about a pandemic threat?
What is it that we're concerned about?
When I say "we," I'm at the Council on Foreign Relations.
We're concerned in the national security community,
and of course in the biology community and the public health community.
While globalization has increased travel,
it's made it necessary that everybody be everywhere,
all the time, all over the world.
And that means that your microbial hitchhikers are moving with you.
So a plague outbreak in Surat, India
becomes not an obscure event, but a globalized event --
a globalized concern that has changed the risk equation.
Katrina showed us
that we cannot completely depend on government
to have readiness in hand, to be capable of handling things.
Indeed, an outbreak would be multiple Katrinas at once.
some of you call it bird flu --
which first emerged in southern China, in the mid-1990s,
but we didn't know about it until 1997.
At the end of last Christmas only 13 countries had seen H5N1.
But we're now up to 55 countries in the world,
have had this virus emerge,
in either birds, or people or both.
In the bird outbreaks we now can see
that pretty much the whole world has seen this virus
except the Americas.
And I'll get into why we've so far been spared in a moment.
it's 100 percent lethal.
It's one of the most lethal things we've seen
in circulation in the world
in any recent centuries.
And we've dealt with it by killing off lots and lots and lots of chickens,
and unfortunately often not reimbursing the peasant farmers
with the result that there's cover-up.
It's also carried on migration patterns
of wild migratory aquatic birds.
There has been this centralized event
in a place called Lake Chenghai, China.
Two years ago the migrating birds
had a multiple event
where thousands died because of a mutation occurring
in the virus,
which made the species range broaden dramatically.
So that birds going to Siberia, to Europe, and to Africa
carried the virus, which had not previously been possible.
so far, fortunately, small events,
tiny outbreaks, occasional clusters.
The virus has mutated dramatically in the last two years
to form two distinct families, if you will,
of the H5N1 viral tree
with branches in them,
and with different attributes that are worrying.
So what's concerning us? Well, first of all,
at no time in history have we succeeded in making
in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine
for more than 260 million people.
It's not going to do us very much good in a global pandemic.
You've heard about the vaccine we're stockpiling.
But nobody believes it will actually be particularly effective
if we have a real outbreak.
after 9/11, when the airports closed,
our flu season was delayed by two weeks.
So the thought is, hey, maybe what we should do is just
immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human,
the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter --
let's shut down the airports.
However, huge supercomputer analyses,
done of the likely effectiveness of this,
show that it won't buy us much time at all.
And of course it will be hugely disruptive in preparation plans.
For example, all masks are made in China.
How do you get them mobilized around the world
if you've shut all the airports down?
How do you get the vaccines moved around the world
and the drugs moved, and whatever may or not be available that would work.
So it turns out that shutting down the airports is counterproductive.
we've ever studied, can be transmitted by eating raw meat
of the infected animals.
We've seen transmission to wild cats and domestic cats,
and now also domestic pet dogs.
And in experimental feedings to rodents and ferrets,
we found that the animals exhibit symptoms never seen with flu:
seizures, central nervous system disorders, partial paralysis.
This is not your normal garden-variety flu.
It mimics what we now understand
about reconstructing the 1918 flu virus,
the last great pandemic,
in that it also jumped directly from birds to people.
We had evolution over time,
and this unbelievable mortality rate in human beings:
55 percent of people who have become infected
with H5N1 have, in fact, succumbed.
And we don't have a huge number of people
who got infected and never developed disease.
you can see that it actually downregulates
a specific immune system modulator.
The result is that what kills you
is not the virus directly, but your own immune system overreacting, saying,
"Whatever this is so foreign I'm going berserk."
The result: most of the deaths
have been in people under 30 years of age,
robustly healthy young adults.
We have seen human-to-human transmission
in at least three clusters --
fortunately involving very intimate contact,
still not putting the world at large at any kind of risk.
Now you probably assume, well the governments are going to do something.
And we have spent a lot of money.
Most of the spending in the Bush administration
has actually been more related to the anthrax results
and bio-terrorism threat.
But a lot of money has been thrown out at the local level and at the federal level
to look at infectious diseases.
End result: only 15 states
have been certified to be able to do mass distribution
of vaccine and drugs in a pandemic.
Half the states would run out of hospital beds
in the first week, maybe two weeks.
And 40 states already have an acute nursing shortage.
Add on pandemic threat, you're in big trouble.
Exercises, drills, all over the world.
Let's pretend there's a pandemic.
Let's everybody run around and play your role.
Main result is that there is tremendous confusion.
Most of these people don't actually know what their job will be.
And the bottom line, major thing that has come through
in every single drill: nobody knows who's in charge.
Nobody knows the chain of command.
If it were Los Angeles, is it the mayor, the governor,
the President of the United States, the head of Homeland Security?
In fact, the federal government says it's a guy called
the Principle Federal Officer,
who happens to be with TSA.
the federal responsibility will basically be
about trying to keep the virus out, which we all know is impossible,
and then to mitigate the impact
primarily on our economy.
The rest is up to your local community.
Everything is about your town, where you live.
Well how good a city council you have,
how good a mayor you have -- that's who's going to be in charge.
Most local facilities would all be competing
to try and get their hands on their piece
of the federal stockpile of a drug called Tamiflu,
which may or may not be helpful -- I'll get into that --
of available vaccines, and any other treatments,
and masks, and anything that's been stockpiled.
And you'll have massive competition.
Now we did purchase a vaccine, you've probably all heard about it,
made by Sanofi-Aventis.
Unfortunately it's made against the current form of H5N1.
We know the virus will mutate. It will be a different virus.
The vaccine will probably be useless.
So here's where the decisions come in.
Let's see, should we order that all pets be kept indoors?
Germany did that when H5N1 appeared in Germany last year,
in order to minimize the spread
between households by household cats, dogs and so on.
What do we do when we don't have any containment rooms
with reverse air that will allow the healthcare workers
to take care of patients?
These are in Hong Kong; we have nothing like that here.
What about quarantine?
During the SARS epidemic in Beijing quarantine did seem to help.
We have no uniform policies
regarding quarantine across the United States.
And some states have differential policies, county by county.
But what about the no-brainer things? Should we close all the schools?
Well then what about all the workers? They won't go to work
if their kids aren't in school.
Encouraging telecommuting? What works?
Six weeks they had all people in the banking industry
pretend a pandemic was underway.
What they found was, the core functions --
you know you still sort of had banks,
but you couldn't get people to put money in the ATM machines.
Nobody was processing the credit cards.
Your insurance payments didn't go through.
And basically the economy would be in a disaster state of affairs.
And that's just office workers, bankers.
shocking. One assumes it's a good idea to wash your hands a lot.
But actually in scientific community there is great debate
about what percentage of flu transmission between people
is from sneezing and coughing
and what percentage is on your hands.
The Institute of Medicine tried to look at the masking question.
Can we figure out a way, since we know we won't have enough masks
because we don't make them in America anymore,
they're all made in China --
do we need N95? A state-of-the-art, top-of-the-line,
must-be-fitted-to-your-face mask?
Or can we get away with some different kinds of masks?
In the SARS epidemic, we learned in Hong Kong
that most of transmission was because
people were removing their masks improperly.
And their hand got contaminated with the outside of the mask,
and then they rubbed their nose. Bingo! They got SARS.
It wasn't flying microbes.
If you go online right now, you'll get so much phony-baloney information.
You'll end up buying -- this is called an N95 mask. Ridiculous.
We don't actually have a standard
for what should be the protective gear for the first responders,
the people who will actually be there on the front lines.
made by Hoffmann-La Roche, patented drug.
There is some indication
that it may buy you some time in the midst of an outbreak.
Should you take Tamiflu for a long period of time,
well, one of the side effects is suicidal ideations.
A public health survey analyzed the effect
that large-scale Tamiflu use would have,
actually shows it counteractive
to public health measures, making matters worse.
And here is the other interesting thing:
when a human being ingests Tamiflu, only 20 percent
is metabolized appropriately
to be an active compound in the human being.
The rest turns into a stable compound,
which survives filtration into the water systems,
thereby exposing the very aquatic birds that would carry flu
and providing them a chance
to breed resistant strains.
And we now have seen Tamiflu-resistant strains
in both Vietnam in person-to-person transmission,
and in Egypt in person-to-person transmission.
So I personally think that our life expectancy
for Tamiflu as an effective drug
is very limited -- very limited indeed.
have based their whole flu policies
on building stockpiles of Tamiflu.
Russia has actually stockpiled enough
for 95 percent of all Russians.
We've stockpiled enough for 30 percent.
When I say enough, that's two weeks worth.
And then you're on your own because
the pandemic is going to last for 18 to 24 months.
Some of the poorer countries
that have had the most experience with H5N1 have built up stockpiles;
they're already expired. They are already out of date.
What do we know from 1918,
the last great pandemic?
The federal government abdicated most responsibility.
And so we ended up with this wild patchwork of regulations
all over America.
Every city, county, state did their own thing.
And the rules
and the belief systems were wildly disparate.
In some cases all schools, all churches,
all public venues were closed.
in the absence of commercial air travel.
The second wave was the mutated, super-killer wave.
And in the first wave we had enough healthcare workers.
But by the time the second wave hit
it took such a toll among the healthcare workers
that we lost most of our doctors and nurses that were on the front lines.
Overall we lost 700,000 people.
The virus was 100 percent lethal to pregnant women
and we don't actually know why.
Most of the death toll was 15 to 40 year-olds --
robustly healthy young adults.
It was likened to the plague.
We don't actually know how many people died.
The low-ball estimate is 35 million.
This was based on European and North American data.
shows that if you look at the databases that were kept
by the Brits in India,
there was a 31-fold greater death rate among the Indians.
So there is a strong belief that in places of poverty
the death toll was far higher.
And that a more likely toll
is somewhere in the neighborhood of 80 to 100 million people
before we had commercial air travel.
So are we ready?
As a nation, no we're not.
And I think even those in the leadership
would say that is the case,
that we still have a long ways to go.
I wouldn't start building up personal stockpiles of anything --
for yourself, your family, or your employees --
unless you've really done your homework.
What mask works, what mask doesn't work.
How many masks do you need?
The Institute of Medicine study felt that
you could not recycle masks.
Well if you think it's going to last 18 months,
are you going to buy 18 months worth of masks
for every single person in your family?
the number one side effect of Tamiflu is
flu-like symptoms.
So then how can you tell
who in your family has the flu
if everybody is taking Tamiflu?
If you expand that out to think of a whole community,
or all your employees in your company,
you begin to realize how limited
the Tamiflu option might be.
Everybody has come up to me and said,
well I'll stockpile water or, I'll stockpile food, or what have you.
But really? Do you really have a place
to stockpile 18 months worth of food? Twenty-four months worth of food?
Do you want to view the pandemic threat
the way back in the 1950s
people viewed the civil defense issue,
and build your own little bomb shelter for pandemic flu?
I don't think that's rational.
as communities, not as individuals --
being prepared as nation,
being prepared as state, being prepared as town.
And right now most of the preparedness
is deeply flawed.
And I hope I've convinced you of that,
which means that the real job is go out and
say to your local leaders,
and your national leaders,
"Why haven't you solved these problems?
Why are you still thinking that
the lessons of Katrina do not apply to flu?"
And put the pressure where the pressure needs to be put.
But I guess the other thing to add is,
if you do have employees, and you do have a company,
I think you have certain responsibilities
to demonstrate that you are thinking ahead for them,
and you are trying to plan.
At a minimum the British banking plan showed that
telecommuting can be helpful.
It probably does reduce exposure
because people are not coming into the office and coughing on each other,
or touching common objects
and sharing things via their hands.
But can you sustain your company that way?
Well if you have a dot-com, maybe you can.
Otherwise you're in trouble.
Happy to take your questions.
(Applause)
I could give you a bunch of flip, this, that, and the other.
But I would say that honestly we don't know.
Clearly the bottom line is
the virus eventually attenuates,
and ceases to be a lethal virus to humanity,
and finds other hosts.
But we don't really know how and why that happens.
It's a very complicated ecology.
You know way more than any of us.
To say ahh, if this happens then we are going to have a pandemic?
of serious human-to-human to transmission.
Not just intimately between family members
who took care of an ailing sister or brother,
but a community infected --
spread within a school,
spread within a dormitory, something of that nature.
Then I think that there is universal agreement
now, at WHO all the way down:
Send out the alert.
Can you talk about that?
and other common statins for cholesterol control
may decrease your vulnerability
to influenza.
But we do not completely understand why.
The mechanism isn't clear.
And I don't know that there is any way
responsibly for someone to start
medicating their children
with their personal supply of Lipitor or something of that nature.
We have absolutely no idea what that would do.
You might be causing some very dangerous outcomes
in your children, doing such a thing.
whether someone is actually carrying, whether somebody has this
before the symptoms are full-blown?
that what we really needed was a rapid diagnostic.
And our Centers for Disease Control
has labeled a test they developed
a rapid diagnostic.
It takes 24 hours in a very highly developed laboratory,
in highly skilled hands.
I'm thinking dipstick.
You could do it to your own kid. It changes color.
It tells you if you have H5N1.
In terms of where we are in science
with DNA identification capacities and so on,
it's not that far off.
But we're not there. And there hasn't been the kind of investment to get us there.
they theorized that there was some attenuation
of the virus when it made the leap into humans.
Is that likely, do you think, here?
I mean 100 percent death rate
is pretty severe.
what the lethality was
of the 1918 strain to wild birds
before it jumped from birds to humans.
It's curious that there is no evidence
of mass die-offs of chickens
or household birds across America
before the human pandemic happened.
That may be because those events
were occurring on the other side of the world
where nobody was paying attention.
But the virus clearly
went through one round around the world
in a mild enough form
that the British army in World War I
actually certified that it was not a threat
and would not affect the outcome of the war.
And after circulating around the world
came back in a form that was tremendously lethal.
What percentage of infected people were killed by it?
Again we don't really know for sure.
It's clear that if you were malnourished to begin with,
you had a weakened immune system,
you lived in poverty in India or Africa,
your likelihood of dying was far greater.
But we don't really know.
the real death cause when you get a flu is the associated pneumonia,
and that a pneumonia vaccine
may offer you 50 percent better chance of survival.
were kind of dismissive of the pandemic flu threat
on the grounds that
back in 1918 they didn't have antibiotics.
And that most people who die of regular flu --
which in regular flu years
is about 360,000 people worldwide,
most of them senior citizens --
and they die not of the flu but because the flu gives an assault to their immune system.
And along comes pneumococcus
or another bacteria, streptococcus
and boom, they get a bacterial pneumonia.
But it turns out that in 1918 that was not the case at all.
And so far in the H5N1 cases in people,
similarly bacterial infection
has not been an issue at all.
It's this absolutely phenomenal disruption of the immune system
that is the key to why people die of this virus.
we saw the same thing with SARS.
So what's going on here is your body says,
your immune system sends out all its sentinels and says,
"I don't know what the heck this is.
We've never seen anything even remotely like this before."
It won't do any good to bring in the sharpshooters
because those antibodies aren't here.
And it won't do any good to bring in the tanks and the artillery
because those T-cells don't recognize it either.
So we're going to have to go all-out thermonuclear response,
stimulate the total cytokine cascade.
The whole immune system swarms into the lungs.
And yes they die, drowning in their own fluids, of pneumonia.
But it's not bacterial pneumonia.
And it's not a pneumonia that would respond to a vaccine.
And I think my time is up. I thank you all for your attention.
(Applause)
which led to all the ideas of the state and social security,
and all the other things that happened in Roosevelt's time.
there was a whole new set of rules
about how the state should intervene.
So ideas change states.
really there are four kinds of ideas
which really make an impact on India.
The first, to my mind,
is what I call as "the ideas that have arrived."
These ideas have brought together something
The third set of ideas are what I call as
"ideas that we argue about" --
those are ideas where we have a fight,
an ideological battle about how to do things.
in the world where you can see the problems that other countries are having,
you can actually anticipate
what that did and do things very differently.
In the '60s and '70s
for the next 30 years.
And this is very important. At the same time
if you peel away the demographic dividend in India,
there are actually two demographic curves.
One is in the south and in the west of India,
which is going to be the bulk of the future demographic dividend.
But a demographic dividend is only as good
as the investment in your human capital.
Only if the people have education,
they have good health, they have infrastructure,
they have roads to go to work, they have lights to study at night --
only in those cases can you really get the benefit
of a demographic dividend.
can be a demographic disaster.
Therefore India is at a critical point
where either it can leverage its demographic dividend
or it can lead to a demographic disaster.
the role of entrepreneurs.
When India got independence entrepreneurs were seen
as a bad lot, as people who would exploit.
This change has contributed
to the vitality and the whole economy.
is our attitude towards the English language.
English language was seen as a language of the imperialists.
something that reduced jobs.
Today we live in a country
which sells eight million mobile phones a month,
of which 90 percent of those mobile phones
are prepaid phones
because people don't have credit history.
Forty percent of those prepaid phones
when there was a report on bank computerization,
they didn't name the report as
a report on computers,
they called them "advanced ledger posting machines."
So we have come a long way from those days
is that Indians today are far more
comfortable with globalization.
Again, after having lived for more than 200 years
But today, as Indian companies go abroad,
as Indians come and work all over the world,
And the fact that the demographics are in our favor,
because we are the only young country in an aging world,
makes globalization all the more attractive to Indians.
the benefits of being in an open society.
And therefore democracy has become embedded.
the rise of the notion of population as human capital,
the rise of Indian entrepreneurs,
and the deepening of democracy -- has contributed
to why India is today growing
at rates it has never seen before.
And really there are four things here.
One is the question of education.
For some reason, whatever reason -- lack of money,
lack of priorities, because of religion having an older culture --
primary education was never given the focus it required.
But now I believe it's reached a point
where it has become very important.
Unfortunately the government schools don't function,
so children are going to private schools today.
Even in the slums of India
more than 50 percent of urban kids are going into private schools.
So I believe primary education is an idea
which is arrived but not yet implemented.
for a long time, infrastructure was not a priority.
Those of you who have been to India have seen that.
20 years back the political slogan was, "Roti, kapada, makaan,"
which meant, "Food, clothing and shelter."
And today's political slogan is, "Bijli, sadak, pani,"
which means "Electricity, water and roads."
And that is a change in the mindset
where infrastructure is now accepted.
So I do believe this is an idea which has arrived,
but simply not implemented.
It's because Gandhi believed in villages
and because the British ruled from the cities,
therefore Nehru thought of New Delhi as an un-Indian city.
cities are engines of creativity,
cities are engines of innovation,
have finally been accepted.
because when you didn't think of India as a market,
The ideas that we argue about.
These are the arguments we have which cause gridlock.
What are those ideas? One is, I think, are ideological issues.
Because of the historical Indian background, in the caste system,
and because of the fact that there have been many people
who have been left out in the cold,
a lot of the politics is about how to make sure
that we'll address that.
And it leads to reservations and other techniques.
It's also related to the way that we subsidize our people,
and all the left and right arguments that we have.
A lot of the Indian problems are related to the ideology
of caste and other things.
This policy is causing gridlock.
This is one of the factors which needs to be resolved.
that 93 percent of Indian labor
is in the unorganized sector.
They have no benefits: they don't have social security;
they don't have pension; they don't have healthcare; none of those things.
This needs to be fixed because unless you can bring these people
into the formal workforce,
you will end up creating a whole lot of people who are completely disenfranchised.
At the same time give a policy for a lot more people to be in the formal sector,
that technology is at a point
where it is much more advanced
than when other countries had the development.
with a set of rich country diseases.
Therefore we're to rethink the whole way we look at health.
We really need to put in place a strategy
so that we don't go to the other extreme of health.
you're seeing the problem of entitlement --
the cost of social security, the cost of Medicare, the cost of Medicaid.
On a population of nine billion
our average carbon emission will have to be about two tons per year.
India is already at two tons per year.
So we're saying: income growing at 16 times and no growth in carbon.
Therefore we will fundamentally rethink the way we look at the environment,
the way we look at energy,
the way we create whole new paradigms of development.
Why does what's happening 10 thousand miles away matter to all of you?
Number one, this matters because
this represents more than a billion people.
And it is important to prove
that growth and democracy are not incompatible,
that you can have a democracy, that you can have an open society,
you need it to solve the world's environment problems.
we really want to put a cap on our carbon emission,
When India was growing at about three, 3.5 percent
and the population was growing at two percent,
and population growth drops to 1.5 percent,
then per capita income is doubling every nine years.
That is why I think all of you
should be equally concerned with it as I am.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,
I thought to myself that well, it's TED.
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough
to justify my participation in something like that?
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent
might help things a bit.
and just talk the way I really talk
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English
because I am from Queens, New York.
(Laughter)
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.
I suppose it's fair to say
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.
But then what?
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.
And well, they're very excited.
What I should tell you --
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.
(Laughter)
Oh, wonderful.
Good evening everybody.
Thank you so very much for having me here today.
Hi sweetheart. Okay.
(Laughter)
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.
She's a very nice, young black girl.
Well you know, she calls herself black --
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.
But anyway.
(Laughter)
She has me here because she puts me in her show,
what she calls her one-woman show.
And you know what that means, of course.
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.
But I don't mind.
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.
Really, it's amazing.
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries
but the celebrities.
There are so many celebrities running around here.
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.
Isn't that adorable?
(Laughter)
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.
You know, she's only half Jewish.
Did you know that about her?
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.
Yeah, she's lovely.
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --
you're all so young.
You know, your parents must be very proud.
I noticed it's very multicultural.
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.
It's like a rainbow.
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.
What are you allowed to say or not say?
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.
But anyway, you know,
I just think that to be here with all of you
accomplished young people --
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.
You know, it's heartening to me.
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,
absolutely horrifying.
It's true. It's true.
You know, between the environmental degradation
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.
Anyway.
(Laughter)
to get us out of this mess.
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.
Thank you for all that you do.
So, happy continued success.
Congratulations. Mazel tov.
(Applause)
Thank you everybody.
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.
My name is Noraida. And I'm just --
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference
that you're doing and everything like that.
I am Dominican-American.
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.
And I think he's Mexican, so that's --
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,
as you can imagine.
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,
that this even exists.
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.
I like that.
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,
which is like a leadership thing,
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.
And the organization is called DA BOMB,
A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --
Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,
but with the war on terror and everything,
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise
and who also happen to be mothers like me.
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.
Right now it's very exciting actually for me
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --
like something like this is so vital
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.
So, I think all people, we need that,
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,
making the talks available online.
That's very good. I love that.
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED
as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.
Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:
friends, neighbors, family members.
I come from a multicultural family.
In fact, the older lady you just met:
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.
It's a long story, believe me.
But on top of my family background,
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,
where I encountered a plethora of new characters,
including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,
you know, she was kind of typically French.
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)
Yes, I took German for three years, [German],
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,
even in the UN school.
Although, you know, it was wonderful.
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.
Never. He always, always treated each of us,
you know, equally unbearably during the class.
classmates from everywhere,
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.
And they've inspired many characters as well.
For example, a friend of mine.
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.
But, you know, I am originally from India,
and I wanted to start by telling you
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity
to come here to TED in California,
originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,
trying to make me feel comfortable
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)
So, you can just imagine -- right.
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.
(Applause)
it's my first time here.
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,
if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."
Good evening.
My name is Pauline Ning,
and first I want to tell you that I'm --
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,
much less like this
because I did not like to give speeches
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
I try anyway.
(Laughter)
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."
I want to tell you story only briefly.
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,
and they would always answer me back in English.
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.
But when they got older,
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"
But I think he will change his mind soon.
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.
But first, she said she's not interested.
She only wants to spend time with her friends.
And then at college, it's like she never came home.
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys
because I don't like them."
(Laughter)
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.
I am lesbian."
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --
(Laughter) --
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.
(Laughter)
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,
but from my son, not my daughter.
(Laughter)
But at first I did not know what to do.
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.
I will share with you that it helps me to realize
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,
because of ideas like this,
and people like you, with an open mind.
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives
in the ways maybe even you don't realize.
So, for my daughter's sake,
I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.
Thank you. Xie xie.
(Applause)
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her
to be last today.
I am originally from Jordan.
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.
It is not Harvard.
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.
But I am very proud of my students.
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,
I do like to make the point that we in global society,
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.
So, back in the ancient times.
[Arabic]
And this roughly translates:
"Please, let me hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
I want to hold your hand.
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life
listening to the Beatles.
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.
Okay? Great.
(Applause)
Thank you for having me.
(Applause)
Thank you very, very much. I love you.
(Applause)
Well, you have to let me say this.
I just -- thank you.
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.
And I know I've performed for some of your companies
or some of you have seen me elsewhere,
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.
(Applause)
comment of Woody Allen
to ask about what is the very best thing to have within your skull.
And it's this machine.
And it's constructed for change. It's all about change.
It confers on us the ability to do things tomorrow that we can't do today,
things today that we couldn't do yesterday.
And of course it's born stupid.
this happens to be my granddaughter, Mitra.
Isn't she fabulous?
(Laughter)
But nonetheless when she popped out
despite the fact that her brain had actually been progressing
in its development for several months before
on the basis of her experiences in the womb --
nonetheless she had very limited abilities,
as does every infant
at the time of normal, natural full-term birth.
If we were to assay her perceptual abilities, they would be crude.
There is no real indication that there is any real thinking going on.
In fact there is little evidence that there is any
cognitive ability in a very young infant.
Infants don't respond to much.
And they can only in a very primitive way, and in a very limited way
control their movements.
could do something as simple as reach out and grasp
under voluntary control an object and retrieve it,
usually to the mouth.
And it will be some months beforeward,
and we see a long steady progression
of the evolution from the first wiggles,
to rolling over, and sitting up, and crawling,
standing, walking,
before we get to that magical point
in which we can motate in the world.
And yet, when we look forward in the brain
we see really remarkable advance.
By this age the brain can actually store.
It has stored, recorded,
can fastly retrieve
the meanings of thousands,
tens of thousands of objects,
actions, and their relationships in the world.
And those relationships can in fact be constructed in hundreds of thousands,
potentially millions of ways.
By this age the brain controls very refined perceptual abilities.
And it actually has a growing repertoire of cognitive skills.
This brain is very much a thinking machine.
And by this age there is absolutely no question
that this brain, it has a person on board.
And in fact at this age it is substantially controlling its own self-development.
And by this age we see a remarkable evolution
in its capacity to control movement.
where it can actually control movement simultaneously,
in a complex sequence, in complex ways
as would be required for example
for playing a complicated game,
like soccer.
Now this boy can bounce a soccer ball on his head.
And where this boy comes from, Sao Paulo, Brazil,
about 40 percent of boys of his age have this ability.
You could go out into the community in Monterey,
and you'd have difficulty finding a boy that has this ability.
And if you did he'd probably be from Sao Paulo.
(Laughter)
that our individual skills and abilities
are very much shaped by our environments.
That environment extends into our contemporary culture,
the thing our brain is challenged with.
Because what we've done in our personal evolutions
is build up a large repertoire of specific skills and abilities
that are specific to our own individual histories.
And in fact they result in a wonderful
differentiation in humankind,
in the way that, in fact, no two of us
are quite alike.
Every one of us has a different set of acquired skills and abilities
that all derive out of the plasticity,
the adaptability of this really remarkable adaptive machine.
In an adult brain of course we've built up
a large repertoire of mastered skills and abilities
that we can perform more or less automatically from memory,
and that define us as acting, moving, thinking creatures.
as the nerdy, laboratory, university-based scientists that we are,
by engaging the brains
of animals like rats, or monkeys,
or of this particularly curious creature --
one of the more bizarre forms of life on earth --
to engage them in learning new skills and abilities.
And we try to track the changes that occur
as the new skill or ability is acquired.
In fact we do this in individuals
of any age, in these different species --
that is to say from infancies,
infancy up to adulthood and old age.
So we might engage a rat, for example,
to acquire a new skill or ability
that might involve the rat using its paw
to master particular manual grasp behaviors
just like we might examine a child
and their ability to acquire the sub-skills,
or the general overall skill of accomplishing something
like mastering the ability to read.
Or you might look in an older individual
who has mastered a complex set of abilities
that might relate to reading musical notation
or performing the mechanical acts of performance
that apply to musical performance.
of the plastic history of the brain.
The first great epoch is commonly called the "Critical Period."
And that is the period in which the brain is setting up
in its initial form its basic processing machinery.
This is actually a period of dramatic change
in which it doesn't take learning, per se, to drive
the initial differentiation of the machinery of the brain.
All it takes for example in the sound domain,
is exposure to sound.
And the brain actually is at the mercy
of the sound environment in which it is reared.
So for example I can rear an animal
in an environment in which there is meaningless dumb sound,
a repertoire of sound that I make up,
that I make, just by exposure, artificially important
to the animal and its young brain.
And what I see is that the animal's brain sets up
its initial processing of that sound
in a form that's idealized, within the limits of its processing achievements
to represent it in an organized and orderly way.
The sound doesn't have to be valuable to the animal:
I could raise the animal in something that could be hypothetically valuable,
like the sounds that simulate
the sounds of a native language of a child.
And I see the brain actually develop a processor that is specialized --
specialized for that complex array, a repertoire of sounds.
It actually exaggerates their separateness of representation,
in multi-dimensional neuronal representational terms.
I can raise an animal under conditions
that would be equivalent to raising a baby
under a moderately loud ceiling fan,
in the presence of continuous noise.
And when I do that I actually specialize the brain
to be a master processor for that meaningless sound.
And I frustrate its ability
to represent any meaningful sound as a consequence.
Such things in the early history of babies
occur in real babies.
And they account for, for example
the beautiful evolution of a language-specific processor
in every normally developing baby.
And so they also account for
development of defective processing
in a substantial population of children
who are more limited, as a consequence,
in their language abilities at an older age.
the brain actually changes outside of a learning context.
I don't have to be paying attention to what I hear.
The input doesn't really have to be meaningful.
I don't have to be in a behavioral context.
This is required so the brain sets up it's processing
so that it can act differentially,
so that it can act selectively,
so that the creature that wears it, that carries it,
can begin to operate on it in a selective way.
In the next great epoch of life, which applies for most of life,
the brain is actually refining its machinery
as it masters a wide repertoire of skills and abilities.
And in this epoch,
which extends from late in the first year of life to death;
it's actually doing this under behavioral control.
And that's another way of saying
the brain has strategies that define
the significance of the input to the brain.
And it's focusing on skill after skill,
or ability after ability,
under specific attentional control.
It's a function of whether a goal in a behavior is achieved
or whether the individual is rewarded in the behavior.
This is actually very powerful.
This lifelong capacity for plasticity, for brain change,
is powerfully expressed.
It is the basis of our real differentiation,
one individual from another.
You can look down in the brain of an animal
that's engaged in a specific skill,
and you can witness or document this change on a variety of levels.
It was actually conducted about five years ago
in collaboration with scientists from the University of Provence
in Marseilles.
It's a very simple experiment where a monkey has been trained
in a task that involves it manipulating a tool
that's equivalent in its difficulty
to a child learning to manipulate or handle a spoon.
The monkey actually mastered the task
in about 700 practice tries.
So in the beginning the monkey could not perform this task at all.
It had a success rate of about one in eight tries.
Those tries were elaborate.
Each attempt was substantially different from the other.
But the monkey gradually developed a strategy.
And 700 or so tries later
the monkey is performing it flawlessly -- never fails.
He's successful in his retrieval of food with this tool every time.
At this point the task is being performed
in a beautifully stereotyped way:
very beautifully regulated and highly repeated, trial to trial.
And we see that it's distorted.
We can track these changes, and have tracked these changes
in many such behaviors across time.
And here we see the distortion
reflected in the map of the skin surfaces of the hand of the monkey.
Now this is a map, down in the surface of the brain,
in which, in a very elaborate experiment we've reconstructed the responses,
location by location,
in a highly detailed response mapping of the responses of its neurons.
We see here a reconstruction of how
the hand is represented in the brain.
We've actually distorted the map by the exercise.
And that is indicated in the pink. We have a couple fingertip surfaces that are larger.
These are the surfaces the monkey is using to manipulate the tool.
If we look at the selectivity of responses
in the cortex of the monkey,
we see that the monkey has actually changed the filter characteristics
which represents input from the skin
of the fingertips that are engaged.
In other words there is still a single, simple representation of the fingertips
in this most organized of cortical areas
of the surface of the skin of the body.
Monkey has like you have.
And yet now it's represented in substantially finer grain.
The monkey is getting more detailed information from these surfaces.
And that is an unknown -- unsuspected, maybe, by you --
part of acquiring the skill or ability.
in the monkey learning this task.
And each one of them changes in ways that are specific
to the skill or ability.
So for example we can look to the cortical area
that represents input that's controlling the posture of the monkey.
We look in cortical areas that control specific movements,
and the sequences of movements
that are required in the behavior, and so forth.
They are all remodeled. They all become specialized for the task at hand.
There are 15 or 20 cortical areas that are changed specifically
when you learn a simple skill like this.
And that represents in your brain, really massive change.
It represents the change in a reliable way
of the responses of tens of millions,
possibly hundreds of millions of neurons in your brain.
It represents changes
of hundreds of millions, possibly billions
of synaptic connections in your brain.
This is constructed by physical change.
And the level of construction that occurs is massive.
Think about the changes that occur in the brain of a child
through the course of acquiring their movement behavior abilities in general.
Or acquiring their native language abilities.
The changes are massive.
of things that are important to the brain.
Because in most of the life of the brain
this is under control of behavioral context.
It's what you pay attention to.
It's what's rewarding to you.
It's what the brain regards, itself,
as positive and important to you.
It's all about cortical processing
and forebrain specialization.
And that underlies your specialization.
That is why you, in your many skills and abilities,
are a unique specialist:
a specialist that's vastly different
in your physical brain in detail
than the brain of an individual 100 years ago;
enormously different in the details
from the brain of the average individual 1,000 years ago.
Now, one of the characteristics of this change process
is that information is always related
to other inputs or information that is occurring
in immediate time, in context.
And that's because the brain is constructing representations of things
that are correlated in little moments of time
and that relate to one another in little moments of successive time.
The brain is recording all information
and driving all change
in temporal context.
Now overwhelmingly the most powerful context
that's occurred in your brain is you.
Billions of events have occurred in your history
that are related in time to yourself
as the receiver,
or yourself as the actor, yourself as the thinker,
yourself as the mover.
Billions of times little pieces of sensation have come in
from the surface of your body
that are always associated with you as the receiver,
and that result in
the embodiment of you.
You are constructed, your self is constructed
from these billions of events.
It's constructed. It's created in your brain.
And it's created in the brain via physical change.
This is a marvelously constructed thing
that results in individual form
because each one of us has vastly different histories,
and vastly different experiences,
that drive in to us this marvelous differentiation of self,
of personhood.
to try to understand not just how a normal person develops,
and elaborates their skills and abilities,
but also try to understand
the origins of impairment,
and the origins of differences or variations
that might limit the capacities of a child, or an adult.
I'm going to talk about using these strategies
to actually design brain plasticity-based
approach to drive corrections in the machinery of a child
that increases the competence of the child
as a language receiver and user
and, thereafter, as a reader.
And I'm going to talk about experiments that involve
actually using this brain science,
first of all to understand how it contributes to the loss of function as we age.
And then, by using it in a targeted approach
we're going to try to differentiate
the machinery to recover function in old age.
relates to children with learning impairments.
We now have a large body of literature
that demonstrates that the fundamental
problem that occurs in the majority of children
that have early language impairments,
and that are going to struggle to learn to read,
is that their language processor
is created in a defective form.
And the reason that it rises in a defective form
is because early in the baby's brain's life
the machine process is noisy.
It's that simple.
It's a signal-to-noise problem. Okay?
And there are a lot of things that contribute to that.
There are numerous inherited faults
that could make the machine process noisier.
Now I might say the noise problem could also occur
on the basis of information provided
in the world from the ears.
that when I was a child we understood that a child born with a cleft palate
was born with what we called mental retardation.
We knew that they were going to be slow cognitively;
we knew they were going to struggle to learn to develop normal language abilities;
and we knew that they were going to struggle to learn to read.
Most of them would be intellectual and academic failures.
That's disappeared. That no longer applies.
That inherited weakness, that inherited condition
has evaporated.
We don't hear about that anymore. Where did it go?
Well, it was understood by a Dutch surgeon,
about 35 years ago,
that if you simply fix the problem early enough,
when the brain is still in this initial plastic period
so it can set up this machinery adequately,
in this initial set up time in the critical period,
none of that happens.
What are you doing by operating on the cleft palate to correct it?
You're basically opening up
the tubes that drain fluid from the middle ears,
which have had them reliably full.
Every sound the child hears uncorrected is muffled.
It's degraded.
The child's native language is such a case is not English.
It's not Japanese.
It's muffled English. It's degraded Japanese.
It's crap.
And the brain specializes for it.
It creates a representation of language crap.
And then the child is stuck with it.
It can also happen in the brain.
The brain itself can be noisy. It's commonly noisy.
There are many inherited faults that can make it noisier.
And the native language for a child with such a brain
is degraded.
It's not English. It's noisy English.
And that results in defective representations of sounds of words --
not normal -- a different strategy,
by a machine that has different time constants and different space constants.
And you can look in the brain of such a child and record those time constants.
They are about an order of magnitude longer,
about 11 times longer in duration on average,
than in a normal child.
Space constants are about three times greater.
Such a child will have memory and cognitive deficits
in this domain.
Of course they will. Because as a receiver of language,
they are receiving it and representing it,
and in information it's representing crap.
And they are going to have poor reading skills.
Because reading is dependent upon the translation of word sounds
into this orthographic or visual
representational form.
If you don't have a brain representation of word sounds
that translation makes no sense.
And you are going to have corresponding abnormal neurology.
in evaluation after evaluation,
in their operations in language, and their operations in reading --
we document that abnormal neurology.
The point is is that you can train the brain out of this.
A way to think about this is you can actually re-refine
the processing capacity of the machinery
by changing it.
Changing it in detail. It takes about 30 hours on the average.
And we've accomplished that in about 430,000 kids today.
Actually, probably about 15,000 children are being trained as we speak.
And actually when you look at the impacts, the impacts are substantial.
What we're most interested in is these kids on the left side of the distribution.
This is from about 3,000 children.
You can see that most of the children on the left side of the distribution
are moving into the middle or the right.
This is in a broad assessment of their language abilities.
This is like an IQ test for language.
The impact in the distribution, if you trained every child
in the United States, would be to shift the whole distribution to the right
and narrow the distribution.
This is a substantially large impact.
Think of the children on the slow side of the class.
We have the potential to move most of those children
to the middle or to the right side.
In addition to accurate language training
it also fixes memory and cognition
speech fluency and speech production.
And an important language dependent skill is enabled by this training --
that is to say reading.
And to a large extent it fixes the brain.
You can look down in the brain of a child
in a variety of tasks that scientists have at Stanford,
and MIT, and UCSF, and UCLA, and a number of other institutions.
And children operating in various language behaviors,
or in various reading behaviors,
you see for the most extent,
for most children, their neuronal responses,
complexly abnormal before you start,
are normalized by the training.
to address problems in aging.
Where again the machinery is deteriorating now
from competent machinery, it's going south.
Noise is increasing in the brain.
And learning modulation and control is deteriorating.
And you can actually look down on the brain of such an individual
and witness a change in the time constants and space constants
with which, for example, the brain is representing language again.
Just as the brain came out of chaos at the beginning,
it's going back into chaos in the end.
This results in declines in memory
in cognition, and in postural ability and agility.
It turns out you can train the brain of such an individual --
this is a small population of such individuals --
train equally intensively for about 30 hours.
These are 80- to 90-year-olds.
of their ability to remember things after a delay,
of their ability to control their attention,
their language abilities and visual-spatial abilities.
The overall neuropsychological index
of these trained individuals in this population
is about two standard deviations.
That means that if you sit at the left side of the distribution,
and I'm looking at your neuropyschological abilities,
the average person has moved to the middle
or the right side of the distribution.
It means that most people who are at risk for senility,
more or less immediately,
are now in a protected position.
older citizens more completely and in larger numbers,
because I think this can be done in this arena on a vast scale --
and the same for kids.
My main interest is how to elaborate this science to address other maladies.
I'm specifically interested in things like autism,
and cerebral palsy, these great childhood catastrophes.
And in older age conditions like Parkinsonism,
and in other acquired impairments like schizophrenia.
is how to maintain your own high-functioning learning machine.
And of course, a well-ordered life
in which learning is a continuous part of it, is key.
But also in your future is brain aerobics.
Get ready for it. It's going to be a part of every life
not too far in the future,
just like physical exercise
is a part of every well organized life in the contemporary period.
The other way that we will ultimately come to consider this
literature and the science that is important to you
is in a consideration of how to nurture yourself.
Now that you know, now that science is telling us
that you are in charge,
that it's under your control,
that your happiness, your well-being,
your abilities, your capacities,
are capable of continuous modification,
continuous improvement,
and you're the responsible agent and party.
Of course a lot of people will ignore this advice.
It will be a long time before they really understand it.
(Laughter)
Now that's another issue and not my fault.
Okay. Thank you.
(Applause)
The first half of the 20th century
was an absolute disaster in human affairs,
a cataclysm.
We had the First World War,
the Great Depression,
the Second World War
and the rise of the communist nations.
And each one of these forces
split the world, tore the world apart,
divided the world.
And they threw up walls --
political walls, trade walls,
transportation walls,
communication walls, iron curtains --
which divided peoples and nations.
that we slowly began to pull ourselves
out of this abyss.
Trade walls began to come tumbling down.
Here are some data on tariffs:
starting at 40 percent, coming down to less than 5 percent.
We globalized the world. And what does that mean?
It means that we extended cooperation
across national boundaries;
we made the world more cooperative.
Transportation walls came tumbling down.
You know in 1950 the typical ship carried
5,000 to 10,000 tons worth of goods.
Today a container ship can carry 150,000 tons;
it can be manned with a smaller crew;
and unloaded faster than ever before.
Communication walls, I don't have to tell you -- the Internet --
have come tumbling down.
And of course the iron curtains,
political walls have come tumbling down.
Trade has increased.
Here is just a little bit of data.
In 1990, exports from China to the United States:
15 billion dollars.
By 2007: over 300 billion dollars.
And perhaps most remarkably,
at the beginning of the 21st century,
really for the first time in modern history,
growth extended to almost all parts of the world.
So China, I've already mentioned,
beginning around 1978, around the time of the death of Mao,
growth -- ten percent a year.
Year after year after year,
absolutely incredible.
Never before in human history
have so many people been raised out of
such great poverty as happened in China.
China is the world's greatest anti-poverty program
over the last three decades.
India, starting a little bit later,
but in 1990, begetting tremendous growth.
Incomes at that time
less than $1,000 per year.
And over the next 18 years
have almost tripled.
Growth of six percent a year. Absolutely incredible.
Now Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa --
Sub-Saharan Africa
has been the area of the world
most resistant to growth.
And we can see the tragedy of Africa
in the first few bars here.
Growth was negative.
People were actually getting poorer than their parents,
and sometimes even poorer than their grandparents had been.
But at the end of the 20th century,
the beginning of the 21st century,
we saw growth in Africa.
And I think, as you'll see, there's reasons for optimism,
because I believe that the best is yet to come.
Now why.
it's new ideas which are driving growth.
And by that I mean it's
products for which the research and development costs
are really high, and the manufacturing costs are low.
More than ever before it is these types of ideas
which are driving growth on the cutting edge.
Now ideas have this amazing property.
Thomas Jefferson, I think, really expressed this quite well.
He said, "He who receives an idea from me
receives instruction himself, without lessening mine.
As he who lights his candle at mine
receives light without darkening me."
Or to put it slightly differently:
one apple feeds one man,
but an idea can feed the world.
Now this is not new. This is practically not new to TEDsters.
This is practically the model of TED.
But what is new is that the greater function of ideas
is going to drive growth even more than ever before.
This provides a reason why
trade and globalization
are even more important, more powerful than ever before,
and are going to increase growth more than ever before.
Suppose that there are two diseases:
one of them is rare, the other one is common,
but if they are not treated they are equally severe.
If you had to choose, which would you rather have:
the common disease or the rare disease?
Common, the common -- I think that's absolutely right,
than there are to treat rare diseases.
The reason for this is incentives.
It costs about the same to produce a new drug
whether that drug treats 1,000 people,
100,000 people, or a million people.
But the revenues are much greater if the drug treats a million people.
So the incentives are much larger
to produce drugs which treat more people.
To put this differently: larger markets save lives.
In this case misery truly does love company.
if China and India were as rich as the United States is today,
the market for cancer drugs would be eight times larger than it is now.
Now we are not there yet, but it is happening.
As other countries become richer
the demand for these pharmaceuticals
is going to increase tremendously.
And that means an increase incentive to do research and development,
which benefits everyone in the world.
Larger markets increase the incentive
to produce all kinds of ideas,
whether it's software, whether it's a computer chip,
whether it's a new design.
For the Hollywood people in the audience,
this even explains why action movies
have larger budgets than comedies:
it's because action movies translate easier
into other languages and other cultures,
so the market for those movies is larger.
People are willing to invest more,
and the budgets are larger.
to produce new ideas,
how do we maximize that incentive?
It's by having one world market, by globalizing the world.
The way I like to put this is:
one idea. Ideas are meant to be shared,
so one idea can serve one world, one market.
One idea, one world, one market.
Well how else can we create new ideas?
That's one reason.
Globalize trade.
How else can we create new ideas?
Well, more idea creators.
Now idea creators, they come from all walks of life.
Artists and innovators -- many of the people you've seen on this stage.
I'm going to focus on scientists and engineers
because I have some data on that, and I'm a data person.
of the world's population are scientists and engineers.
(Laughter)
The United States has been an idea leader.
A large fraction of those people are in the United States.
But the U.S. is losing its idea leadership.
And for that I am very grateful.
That is a good thing.
It is fortunate that we are becoming less of an idea leader
because for too long the United States,
and a handful of other developed countries,
have shouldered the entire burden
of research and development.
But consider the following:
if the world as a whole were as wealthy as the United States is now
there would be more than five times as many scientists and engineers
contributing to ideas which benefit everyone,
which are shared by everyone.
I think of the great Indian mathematician, Ramanujan.
How many Ramanujans are there in India today
toiling in the fields, barely able to feed themselves,
when they could be feeding the world?
Now we're not there yet.
But it is going to happen in this century.
The real tragedy of the last century is this:
if you think about the world's population
as a giant computer, a massively parallel processor,
then the great tragedy has been
that billions of our processors have been off line.
But in this century China is coming on line.
India is coming on line.
Africa is coming on line.
We will see an Einstein in Africa in this century.
1996: less than one million
new university students in China per year;
2006: over five million.
Now think what this means.
This means we all benefit when another country gets rich.
We should not fear other countries becoming wealthy.
That is something that we should embrace --
a wealthy China, a wealthy India, a wealthy Africa.
We need a greater demand for ideas --
those larger markets I was talking about earlier --
and a greater supply of ideas for the world.
Now you can see some of the reasons why I'm optimistic.
Globalization is increasing the demand
for ideas, the incentive to create new ideas.
Investments in education are increasing the supply of new ideas.
you can see some reasons for optimism.
From about the beginnings of humanity
1500 to 1800: maybe a little bit of economic growth,
but less in a century
than you expect to see in a year today.
1900s: maybe one percent.
Twentieth century: a little bit over two percent.
Twenty-first century could easily be 3.3, even higher percent.
Even at that rate,
by 2100 average GDP per capita
in the world will be $200,000.
That's not U.S. GDP per capita, which will be over a million,
but world GDP per capita -- $200,000.
That's not that far.
We won't make it.
But some of our grandchildren probably will.
And I should say,
I think this is a rather modest prediction.
In Kurzweilian terms this is gloomy.
In Kurzweilian terms I'm like the Eeyore of economic growth.
(Laughter)
What about a great depression?
Well let's take a look. Let's take a look at the Great Depression.
Here is GDP per capita
from 1900 to 1929.
Now let's imagine that you were an economist in 1929,
trying to forecast future growth for the United States,
not knowing that the economy was about to go off a cliff,
not knowing that we were about to enter
the greatest economic disaster certainly in the 20th century.
What would you have predicted, not knowing this?
If you had based your prediction, your forecast
on 1900 to 1929
you'd have predicted something like this.
If you'd been a little more optimistic --
say, based upon the Roaring Twenties -- you'd have said this.
So what actually happened?
We went off a cliff but we recovered.
In fact in the second half of the 20th century
growth was even higher than anything you would have predicted
based upon the first half of the 20th century.
So growth can wash away
even what appears to be a great depression.
Oil. Oil. This was a big topic.
When I was writing up my notes oil was $140 per barrel.
So people were asking a question. They were saying,
"Is China drinking our milkshake?"
(Laughter)
And there is some truth to this,
in the sense that we have something of a finite resource,
and increased growth is going to push up demand for that.
But I think I don't have to tell this audience
that a higher price of oil is not necessarily a bad thing.
Moreover, as everyone knows,
look -- it's energy, not oil, which counts.
And higher oil prices mean
a greater incentive to invest in energy R&D.
You can see this in the data.
As oil prices go up, energy patents go up.
The world is much better equipped
to overcome an increase in the price of oil
today, than ever in the past,
because of what I'm talking about.
One idea, one world, one market.
so long as we hew to these two ideas:
to keep globalizing world markets,
keep extending cooperation across national boundaries,
and keep investing in education.
Now the United States has a particularly important role
to play in this:
to keep our education system globalized,
to keep our education system open to students from all over the world,
because our education system
is the candle
that other students come to light their own candles.
Now remember here what Jefferson said.
Jefferson said, "When they come
and light their candles at ours,
they gain light, and we are not darkened."
But Jefferson wasn't quite right, was he?
Because the truth is,
when they light their candles at ours,
there is twice as much light available for everyone.
So my view is: Be optimistic.
Spread the ideas. Spread the light.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to talk about the election.
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters
voted for an African-American candidate for President.
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.
He won 375 electoral votes.
And he won about 70 million popular votes
more than any other presidential candidate --
of any race, of any party -- in history.
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --
Democrats really like seeing this transition here,
where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --
even states Obama lost, like out west,
those states became more blue.
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere
but with a couple of exceptions here and there.
That was John Kerry's home state.
No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,
Obama didn't have much improvement.
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton --
the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96,
you see real big differences in this part of the country right here,
the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:
20 or 30 point swings
from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did
in 2008.
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.
He lost badly but every Democrat does.
He lost no worse than most people do.
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?
(Laughter)
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote
for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?
We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that
is because we asked those people.
Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted
exit polls in every state,
in 37 states, out of the 50,
they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.
They asked this question.
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race
of the candidate a factor?
We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;
moreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"
and people who voted for John McCain
as a result of that factor,
maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.
We're looking for this behavior among white voters
or, really, non-black voters.
of the country on this question.
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters
said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama
is because he was an African-American."
If those people had voted for Obama,
even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"
but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this
admitted, I suppose,
manifestation of racially-based voting.
Here is the same data on a map.
You kind of see the relationship between
the redder states of where more people responded and said,
"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.
This really seems to explain
why Barack Obama did worse
in this one part of the country.
Is racism predictable in some way?
Is there something driving this?
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas
that we don't understand, and Kentucky?
Or are there more systematic factors at work?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time --
things like income, and religion, education.
Which of these seem to drive
this manifestation of racism
in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?
And there are a couple of these that have
strong predictive relationships,
one of which is education,
where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling
per adult are in red,
and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,
is less educated. It's just a fact.
And you see the relationship there
with the racially-based voting patterns.
The other variable that's important is
the type of neighborhood that you live in.
States that are more rural --
even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine --
they exhibit a little bit of
this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education
and the type of neighbors that you have,
which we'll talk about more in a moment.
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee
is that they're both very rural,
and they are educationally impoverished.
These things, among maybe other variables,
but these things seem to predict it.
We're going to drill down a little bit more now,
into something called the General Social Survey.
This is conducted by the University of Chicago
every other year.
And they ask a series of really interesting questions.
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions
about racial attitudes.
One simple question they asked is,
"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.
In cites, about 80 percent of people
have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,
but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people
who are unlike you.
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey
and split them between those who have black neighbors --
or, really, some neighbor of another race --
and people who have only white neighbors.
And we see in some variables
in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.
This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.
But you see Democrats versus Republican,
not a big difference based on who your neighbors are.
affirmative action, which is kind of a political question,
a policy question about race, if you will --
not much difference here.
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods
feel no differently about it really.
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,
"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"
There is a big difference.
People who don't have neighbors of a different race
are about twice as likely
to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.
And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,
"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who
were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."
It's about who you live with.
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by
interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.
So if you want to address it,
the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,
ideas for maybe how to do that.
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,
and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,
the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.
But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.
So we can think more about things like street grids.
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.
And you interact a lot with your neighbors --
people you like, people you might not know.
And as a result it's a very tolerant community,
which is different, I think, than something like this,
which is in Schaumburg, Illinois,
where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac
and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.
I think that actually this type of urban design,
which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s --
I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming
more conservative under Ronald Reagan.
is an intercollegiate exchange program
where you have students going from New York abroad.
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now
where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,
have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,
and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee
and might never interact in a positive affirmative way
with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.
I think part of the education variable we talked about before
is the networking experience you get when you go to college
where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.
because when something is predictable,
it is what I call designable.
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,
even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.
If we understand the root causes of the behavior
and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,
we can start to design solutions to it.
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.
(Applause)

So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.
A year and a half ago,
four of the five people who are full time members
at Ushahidi,
which means "testimony" in Swahili,
were TED Fellows.
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence.
And in that time we prototyped and built,
in about three days, a system that would allow
anybody with a mobile phone
to send in information and reports on what was happening around them.
We took what we knew about Africa,
the default device,
the mobile phone, as our common denominator,
and went from there.
We got reports like this.
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.
It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people,
and we put it on our map.
We needed to take what we had built
and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.
And so there is a team of developers
from all over Africa, who are part of this team now --
from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.
There is even some from the U.S.
We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world,
as well as the developing world.
If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere.
And so we build for it in Africa first
and then we move to the edges.
It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa,
small NGOs doing their own little projects.
Just this last month it was deployed by
Al Jazeera in Gaza.
But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.
because what we're finding out is that
we have this capacity to report
eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.
We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently,
where it's so much easier to report now
than it is to consume it.
There is so much information; what do you do?
This is the Twitter reports for over three days
just covering Mumbai.
How do you decide what is important?
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at?
So what we find is that there is this
great deal of wasted crisis information
because there is just too much information for us to
actually do anything with right now.
And what we're actually really concerned with
is this first three hours.
What we are looking at is the first three hours.
How do we deal with that information that is coming in?
You can't understand what is actually happening.
On the ground and around the world
people are still curious,
and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know.
is crowdsourcing this information.
You see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload.
So you've got a lot of information. That's great.
But now what?
So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.
And we have a small team who is working on this.
We think that we can actually create
a crowdsourced filter.
Take the crowd and apply them to the information.
And by rating it and by rating
the different people who submit information,
we can get refined results
and weighted results.
So that we have a better understanding
of the probability of something being true or not.
This is the kind of innovation that is,
quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.
It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect.
From young, smart developers.
And it's a community around it that has decided to build this.
So, thank you very much.
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family.

When I was five years old
I fell in love with airplanes.
Now I'm talking about the '30s.
In the '30s an airplane had two wings
and a round motor,
and was always flown
by a guy who looked like Cary Grant.
He had high leather boots,
jodhpurs, an old leather jacket,
a wonderful helmet
and those marvelous goggles --
and, inevitably, a white scarf,
to flow in the wind.
He'd always walk up to his airplane
in a kind of saunter,
devil-may-care saunter,
flick the cigarette away,
grab the girl waiting here, give her a kiss.
(Laughter)
And then mount his airplane,
maybe for the last time.
Of course I always wondered what would happen
if he'd kissed the airplane first.
(Laughter)
Everything about flying in those years,
which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment --
was probably the most advanced
technological thing going on at the time.
So as a youngster,
I tried to get close to this
by drawing airplanes,
constantly drawing airplanes.
It's the way I got
a part of this romance.
And of course, in a way, when I say romance,
I mean in part
the aesthetics of that whole situation.
I think the word is the holistic experience
revolving around a product.
The product was that airplane.
But it built a romance.
Even the parts of the airplane
had French names.
Ze fuselage, ze empanage, ze nessal.
You know, from a romance language.
So that it was something that just got into your spirit.
It did mine.
just drawing fantasy airplanes.
I wanted to build airplanes.
So I built model airplanes.
And I found that in doing the model airplanes
the appearance drawings were not enough.
You couldn't transfer those
to the model itself.
If you wanted it to fly
you had to learn the discipline
of flying.
You had to learn about aeronautics.
You had to learn what made an airplane
stay in the air.
And of course, as a model in those years, you couldn't control it.
So it had to be self-righting,
and stay up without crashing.
So I had to give up
the approach of drawing
the fantasy shapes
and convert it to technical drawings --
the shape of the wing, the shape of the fuselage and so on --
and build an airplane over these drawings
that I knew followed some of the principles
of flying.
And in so doing, I could produce
a model that would fly, stay in the air.
And it had, once it was in the air,
some of this romance that I was in love with.
led me to,
when I had the opportunity to choose
a course in school,
led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering.
And when I was sitting in classes --
in which no one asked me to draw an airplane --
to my surprise.
I had to learn mathematics and mechanics
and all this sort of thing.
I'd wile away my time drawing airplanes
in the class.
One day a young man looked over my shoulder,
he said, "You draw very well.
You should be in the art department."
And I said, "Why?"
And he said, "Well for one thing, there are more girls there."
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
And I went into art
because they appreciated drawing.
Studied painting; didn't do very well at that.
Went through design,
some architecture.
Eventually hired myself out as a designer.
And for the following 25 years,
living in Italy,
living in America,
I doled out a piece of this romance
to anybody who'd pay for it --
this sense, this aesthetic feeling,
for the experience revolving around
a designed object.
And it exists.
Any of you who rode the automobiles --
was it yesterday? --
at the track, you know the romance
revolving around those high performance cars.
I was mostly putting out
pieces of this romance
and not getting a lot back in
because design on call
doesn't always connect you with a circumstance
in which you can produce things of this nature.
So after 25 years I began to feel
as though I was running dry.
And I quit.
And I started up a very small operation --
went from 40 people
to one,
in an effort to rediscover my innocence.
I wanted to get back
where the romance was.
because they had gotten sort of unromantic
at that point,
even though I'd done a lot of airplane work,
on the interiors.
So I chose furniture.
And I chose chairs specifically
because I knew something about them.
I'd designed a lot of chairs, over the years
for tractors and trucks
and submarines --
all kinds of things.
But not office chairs.
So I started doing that.
And I found that there were ways
to duplicate the same approach
that I used to use on the airplane.
Only this time,
instead of the product being shaped by the wind,
it was shaped by the human body.
So the discipline was --
as in the airplane you learn a lot about
how to deal with the air,
for a chair
you have to learn a lot about how to deal
with the body,
and what the body needs, wants,
indicates it needs.
And that's the way, ultimately
after some ups and downs,
I ended up designing the chair I'm going to show you.
model airplanes,
I did everything.
I conceived the kind of airplane.
I basically engineered it.
I built it.
And I flew it.
And that's the way I work now.
When I started this chair
it was not a preconceived notion.
Design nowadays, if you mean it,
you don't start with styling sketches.
I started with a lot of loose ideas,
roughly eight or nine years ago.
And the loose ideas had something
to do with what I knew happened with
people in the office,
at the work place -- people who worked,
and used task seating,
a great many of them sitting in front of a computer
all day long.
And I felt,
the one thing they don't need,
is a chair that interferes
with their main reason for sitting there.
that the chair should do as much for them
as humanly possible
or as mechanistically possible
so that they didn't have to fuss with it.
So my idea was that,
instead of sitting down and reaching
for a lot of controls,
that you would sit on the chair,
and it would automatically balance your weight
against the force required
to recline.
Now that may not mean a lot to some of you.
But you know most good chairs do recline
because it's beneficial to open up this joint
between your legs and your upper body
for better breathing
and better flow.
So that if you sit down
on my chair,
whether you're five feet tall
or six foot six,
it always deals with your weight
and transfers the amount of force required
to recline
in a way that you don't have to look
for something to adjust.
this is a trade off.
There are drawbacks to this.
One is: you can't
accommodate everybody.
There are some very light people,
some extremely heavy people,
maybe people with a lot of bulk up top.
They begin to fall off the end of your chart.
But the compromise, I felt,
was in my favor
because most people don't adjust their chairs.
They will sit in them forever.
I had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack
tell me about his sister calling him.
He said she had one of the new, better chairs.
She said, "Oh I love it."
She said, "But it's too high."
(Laughter)
So he said, "Well I'll come over and look at it."
He came over and looked at it.
He reached down. He pulled a lever. And the chair sank down.
She said, "Oh it's wonderful. How did you do that?"
And he showed her the lever.
Well, that's typical
of a lot of us working in chairs.
And why should you
get a 20-page manual
about how to run a chair?
(Laughter)
I had one for a wristwatch once. 20 pages.
that you didn't have to make an adjustment
in order to get this kind of action.
The other thing I felt was that armrests
had never really been properly approached
from the standpoint of how much
of an aid they could be
to your work life.
But I felt it was too much to ask
to have to adjust each individual armrest
in order to get it where you wanted.
So I spent a long time.
I said I worked eight or nine years on it.
And each of these things went along
sort of in parallel
but incrementally were a problem of their own.
I worked a long time on figuring out
how to move the arms over a much greater arc --
that is up and down --
and make them a lot easier,
so that you didn't have to use a button.
And so after many trials, many failures,
we came up with a very simple arrangement
in which we could just move
one arm or the other.
And they go up easily.
And stop where you want.
You can put them down, essentially out of the way.
No arms at all.
Or you can pull them up where you want them.
And this was another thing that I felt,
while not nearly as romantic
as Cary Grant,
nevertheless begins to
grab a little bit of aesthetic
operation, aesthetic performance
into a product.
was the fact that reclining
was a very important factor.
And the more you can recline,
in a way, the better it is.
The more the angle between here and here opens up --
and nowadays, with a screen in front of you,
you don't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline,
so we keep it at more or less the same level --
but you transfer weight
off your tailbones.
Would everybody put their hand under their bottom
and feel their tailbone?
(Laughter)
You feel that bone under there?
(Laughter)
Just your own.
(Laughter)
There's two of them, one on either side.
All the weight of your upper torso --
your arms, your head --
goes right down through your back,
your spine, into those bones when you sit.
And that's a lot of load.
Just relieving your arms with armrests
takes 20 percent of that load off.
Now that, if your spine is not held in a good position,
will help bend your spine the wrong way, and so on.
So to unload
that great weight --
if that indeed exists --
you can recline.
When you recline you take away a lot of that load
off your bottom end, and transfer it to your back.
At the same time, as I say, you open up this joint.
And breathability is good.
amount of recline,
it gets to the point where you need a headrest
because nearly always,
automatically hold your head
in a vertical position, see?
As I recline, my head says more or less vertical.
Well if you're reclined a great deal,
you have to use muscle force
to hold your head there.
So that's where a headrest comes in.
Now headrest is a challenge
because you want it to adjust
enough so that it'll fit,
you know, a tall guy and a short girl.
So here we are.
I've got five inches of adjustment here
in order to get the headrest in the right place.
But then I knew from experience
and looking around in offices
where there were chairs with headrests
that nobody would ever bother
to reach back and turn a knob
and adjust the headrest to put it in position.
And you need it in a different position
when you're upright, then when you're reclined.
So I knew that had to be solved, and had to be automatic.
So if you watch this chair
as I recline, the headrest comes up
to meet my neck.
Ideally you want to put the head support
in the cranial area, right there.
So that part of it took a long time
to work out.
the gel we put.
We stole the idea from bicycle seats,
and put gel in the cushions
and in the armrests
to absorb point load --
distributes the loading so you don't get hard spots.
You cant hit your elbow
on bottom.
And I did want to demonstrate
the fact that the chair can accommodate people.
While you're sitting in it you can adjust it
down for the five-footer,
or you can adjust it
for the six-foot-six guy --
all within the scope of a few simple adjustments.
(Applause)
When most people think about the beginnings
of AIDS, they're gonna think back to the 1980s.
And certainly, this was the decade in which we discovered AIDS
and the virus that causes it, HIV.
in Brazzaville, Congo.
At this time, there were thousands of individuals,
we think, that were infected with HIV.
One of the things I want you to note from it
We look at the diseases, which are in the animals as well as the humans.
And ideally, this is going to allow us to catch these things
early on, as they're moving over into human populations.
And the basic objective of this work is not to just
go out once and look at these individuals,
but to establish thousands of individuals
in these populations that we would monitor
continuously on a regular basis.
When they were sick, we would collect specimens from them.
We give them these little pieces of filter paper.
When they sample from animals,
they collect the blood on the filter paper
and this allows us to identify yet-unknown viruses from exactly the right animals --
Their names are Patrice and Patee.
They're searching for bush meat;
forest animals they can kill to feed their families.
Patrice and Patee set out most days to go out hunting
in the forest around their homes.
They have a series of traps, of snares that they've set up
to catch wild pigs, snakes, monkeys,
rodents -- anything they can, really.
Patrice and Patee have been out for hours but found nothing.
The animals are simply gone.
A group of hunters approach,
their packs loaded with wild game.
There's at least three viruses
that you know about, which are in this particular monkey.
These individuals are at specific risk,
particularly if there's blood contact, they're at risk for transmission
and possibly infection with novel viruses.
The blood will be tested for zoonotic viruses,
part of a program Dr. Wolfe has spent years setting up.
Every person who has one of those filter papers has at least,
at a minimum, been through our basic health education
about the risks associated with these activities,
which presumably, from our perspective,
gives them the ability to decrease their own risk,
and then obviously the risk to their families,
the village, the country, and the world.
OK? And you can consider all sorts of different bush meat.
I'm going to be talking about this.
When your children and grandchildren
sort of pose questions to you about this period of time,
one of the things they're gonna ask you,
is how it was they we allowed some of our closest living relatives,
some of the most valuable and endangered species
on our planet, to go extinct because we
weren't able to address some of the issues
of poverty in these parts of the world.
that when we knew that this was the way that HIV entered
into the human population,
and that other diseases had the potential to enter like this,
why did we let these behaviors continue?
Why did we not find some other solution to this?
They're going to say, in regions of profound
instability throughout the world,
where you have intense poverty, where populations are growing
and you don't have sustainable resources like this,
this is going to lead to food insecurity.
which is, why we thought the responsibility rested with this individual here.
Now this is the individual -- you can see just right up over his right shoulder --
this is the individual that hunted the monkey
from the last picture that I showed you.
OK, take a look at his shirt.
You know, take a look at his face.
Bush meat is one of the central crises,
which is occurring in our population right now,
in humanity, on this planet.
But it can't be the fault of somebody like this.
OK? And solving it cannot be his responsibility alone.
There's no easy solutions,
but what I'm saying to you is that we neglect this problem
at our own peril.
we went to actually start this work
in Central Africa, to work with hunters
in this part of the world.
And my job -- at that time I was a post-doctoral fellow,
and I was really tasked with setting this up.
So I said to myself, "OK, great --
we're gonna collect all kinds of specimens. We're gonna go to all these
different locations. It's going to be wonderful."
You know, I looked at the map; I picked out 17 sites;
I figured, no problem.
(Laughter)
Fortunately, I had and continue to have
an absolutely wonderful team of colleagues and collaborators in my own team,
and that's the only way that this work can really occur.
We have a whole range of challenges about this work.
The person you see on the right hand side is Paul DeLong-Minutu.
He's one of the best communicators that I've really ever dealt with.
When I arrived I didn't speak a word of French,
and I still seemed to understand what it was he was saying.
Paul worked for years
on the Cameroonian national radio and television,
and he spoke about health issues. He was a health correspondent.
So we figured we'd hire this person -- when we got there he could
be a great communicator.
When we would get to these rural villages, though, what we found out
is that no one had television,
so they wouldn't recognize his face.
But -- when he began to speak
they would actually recognize his voice from the radio.
And this was somebody who had incredible
potential to spread aspects of our message,
whether it be with regards to wildlife conservation
or health prevention.
with specimens from 200 individuals
that we needed to get back to the lab within 48 hours.
I like to show this shot -- this is
Ubald Tamoufe, who's the lead
investigator in our Cameroon site.
Ubald laughs at me when I show this photo
because of course you can't see his face.
But the reason I like to show the shot
is because you can see that he's about to solve this problem.
(Laughter)
Which -- which he did, which he did.
Just a few quick before and after shots.
This was our laboratory before.
This is what it looks like now.
Early on, in order to ship our specimens,
we had to have dry ice. To get dry ice we had to go
to the breweries -- beg, borrow, steal to get these folks to give it to us.
Now we have our own liquid nitrogen.
I like to call our laboratory the coldest place in Central Africa -- it might be.
And here's a shot of me, this is the before shot of me.
(Laughter)
No comment.
We made a number of discoveries.
And what we've found is that if you look in the right place,
you can actually monitor the flow
of these viruses into human populations.
That gave us a tremendous amount of hope.
What we've found is a whole range of new viruses in these individuals,
including new viruses in the same group
as HIV -- so, brand new retroviruses.
And let's face it, any new retrovirus in the
human population -- it's something we should be aware of.
It's something we should be following. It's not something
that we should be surprised by.
might very well have gone extinct.
That's no longer the case. Logging roads provide access to urban areas.
And critically, what happens in central Africa
doesn't stay in Central Africa.
So, once we discovered that it was really possible
that we could actually do this monitoring,
we decided to move this from research, to
really attempt to phase up to a global monitoring effort.
Through generous support and partnership
scientifically with Google.org and the Skoll Foundation,
we were able to start the Global Viral Forecasting Initiative
and begin work in four different sites
in Africa and Asia.
Needless to say, different populations from different parts of the world
have different sorts of contact.
So it's not just hunters in Central Africa.
It's also working in live animal markets --
these wet markets -- which is exactly the place where
SARS emerged in Asia.
But really, this is just the beginning from our perspective.
is to identify new partners
because we feel like this effort needs to be extended
to probably 20 or more sites throughout the world -- to viral hotspots --
because really the idea here is to cast an incredibly wide net
so that we can catch these things, ideally,
before they make it to blood banks,
sexual networks, airplanes. And that's really our objective.
There was a time not very long ago
when the discovery of unknown organisms
was something that held incredible awe for us.
It had potential to really change the way that we saw ourselves,
and thought about ourselves.
we've reached a point where we've discovered most of the things.
I'm going tell you right now: please don't despair.
If an intelligent extra-terrestrial
was taxed with writing the encyclopedia of life on our planet,
27 out of 30 of these volumes
would be devoted to bacteria and virus,
with just a few of the volumes left
for plants, fungus and animals,
humans being a footnote;
interesting footnote but a footnote nonetheless.
This is honestly the most exciting period
ever for the study of unknown life forms on our planet.
The dominant things that exist here
we know almost nothing about.
And yet finally, we have the tools, which will allow us to actually explore that world
and understand them.
I'm here today, as June said,
to talk about a project
that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years.
We're crocheting a coral reef.
And it's a project that we've actually
been now joined by hundreds of people around the world,
who are doing it with us. Indeed thousands of people
have actually been involved in this project,
in many of its different aspects.
It's a project that now reaches across three continents,
and its roots go into the fields of mathematics,
marine biology, feminine handicraft
and environmental activism.
It's true.
It's also a project
that in a very beautiful way,
the development of this
has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth,
which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying
right here in February 2009 --
which, as one of our previous speakers told us,
is the 200th anniversary
of the birth of Charles Darwin.
But let me first begin by showing you
some pictures of what this thing looks like.
Just to give you an idea of scale,
that installation there is about six feet across,
and the tallest models are about two or three feet high.
This is some more images of it.
That one on the right is about five feet high.
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models.
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people
have contributed all over the world as part of this.
The totality of this project
involves tens of thousands of hours
of human labor --
99 percent of it done by women.
On the right hand side, that bit there is part of an installation
that is about 12 feet long.
because in that year, at least in the science press,
there was a lot of talk about global warming,
and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs.
Corals are very delicate organisms,
and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures.
It causes these vast bleaching events
that are the first signs of corals of being sick.
And if the bleaching doesn't go away --
if the temperatures don't go down -- reefs start to die.
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef,
particularly in coral reefs all over the world.
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef.
which is a little organization we started
to promote, to do projects about the
aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics.
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site,
asking for people to join us in this enterprise.
To our surprise, one of the first people who called
and they'd like our coral reef to be part of it.
I laughed and said, "Well we've only just started it,
you can have a little bit of it."
So in 2007 we had an exhibition,
a small exhibition of this crochet reef.
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said,
"In late 2007, the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is
global warming. And we've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery
and we want you to fill it with your reef."
And I, naively by this stage, said, "Oh, yes, sure."
Now I say "naively" because actually
my profession is as a science writer.
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics.
I've written books about the history of space,
the history of physics and religion,
and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times.
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
So I said yes to this proposition.
And I went home, and I told my sister Christine.
And she nearly had a fit
because Christine is a professor at one of
L.A.'s major art colleges, CalArts,
and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery.
She thought I'd gone off my head.
But she went into crochet overdrive.
And to cut a long story short, eight months later
we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center's
3,000 square foot gallery.
a viral dimension of its own,
which got completely beyond us.
The people in Chicago decided
that as well as exhibiting our reefs, what they wanted to do
was have the local people there make a reef.
So we went and taught the techniques. We did workshops and lectures.
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own.
And it was exhibited alongside ours.
There were hundreds of people involved in that.
We got invited to do the whole thing
in New York, and in London,
and in Los Angeles.
In each of these cities, the local citizens,
hundreds and hundreds of them, have made a reef.
And more and more people get involved in this,
most of whom we've never met.
So the whole thing has sort of morphed
into this organic, ever-evolving creature,
that's actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
"What planet are these people on?
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef?
Woolenness and wetness aren't exactly
two concepts that go together.
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble?
Cast it in bronze."
But it turns out there is a very good reason
why we are crocheting it
because many organisms in coral reefs
have a very particular kind of structure.
The frilly crenulated forms that you see
in corals, and kelps, and sponges and nudibranchs,
is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry.
And the only way that mathematicians know
how to model this structure
is with crochet. It happens to be a fact.
It's almost impossible to model this structure any other way,
and it's almost impossible to do it on computers.
So what is this hyperbolic geometry
that corals and sea slugs embody?
to the level of a sea slug.
(Laughter)
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics
when it was first discovered in the 19th century.
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand
how they could model it.
In 1997 a mathematician
at Cornell, Daina Taimina,
made the discovery that this structure
could actually be done in knitting and crochet.
crochet was the better thing.
But what she was doing was actually making a model
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure
was impossible per se.
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years
trying to prove that this structure was impossible.
Euclidean space, and spherical space.
And they have different properties.
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist.
You all have a sense of what a flat space is, Euclidean space is.
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way.
And what they do is, they do it through the concept
of parallel lines.
So here we have a line and a point outside the line.
And Euclid said, "How can I define parallel lines?
I ask the question, how many lines can I draw through
the point but never meet the original line?"
And you all know the answer. Does someone want to shout it out?
One. Great. Okay.
That's our definition of a parallel line.
It's a definition really of Euclidean space.
Think of the surface of a sphere --
just like a beach ball, the surface of the Earth.
I have a straight line on my spherical surface.
but never meet the original line?
What do we mean to talk about
a straight line on a curved surface?
Now mathematicians have answered that question.
They've understood there is a generalized concept
of straightness, it's called a geodesic.
And on the surface of a sphere,
a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw.
So it's like the equator or the lines of longitude.
So we ask the question again,
"How many straight lines can I draw through the point,
but never meet the original line?"
Does someone want to guess?
Zero. Very good.
It's a bit suspicious isn't it? There is two answers to the question so far,
Zero and one.
Two answers? There may possibly be a third alternative.
To a mathematician if there are two answers,
and the first two are zero and one,
there is another number that immediately suggests itself
as the third alternative.
Does anyone want to guess what it is?
Infinity. You all got it right. Exactly.
There is, there's a third alternative.
This is what it looks like.
There's a straight line, and there is an infinite number of lines
that go through the point and never meet the original line.
This is the drawing.
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers
because, like you, they're sitting there feeling bamboozled.
Thinking, how can that be? You're cheating. The lines are curved.
But that's only because I'm projecting it onto a
flat surface.
Mathematicians for several hundred years
had to really struggle with this.
How could they see this?
What did it mean to actually have a physical model
Then our mathematicians come along
And you go, "Ah! I can see it. I can feel it.
I can touch it. I can play with it."
And that's exactly what happened
when Daina Taimina
in 1997, showed that you could crochet models
in hyperbolic space.
Here is this diagram in crochetness.
I've stitched Euclid's parallel postulate on to the surface.
And the lines look curved.
But look, I can prove to you that they're straight
because I can take any one of these lines,
and I can fold along it.
And it's a straight line.
So here, in wool,
through a domestic feminine art,
(Applause)
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics
that is called non-Euclidean geometry.
And this is actually the field of mathematics
that underlies general relativity
and is actually ultimately going to show us
about the shape of the universe.
So there is this direct line
between feminine handicraft,
Euclid and general relativity.
Here's two creatures who've never heard of Euclid's parallel postulate --
They've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years.
I once asked the mathematicians why it was
that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible
when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age.
Their answer was interesting.
They said, "Well I guess there aren't that many mathematicians
sitting around looking at sea slugs."
And that's true. But it also goes deeper than that.
It also says a whole lot of things
about what mathematicians thought mathematics was,
but the lettuce on their plate --
because lettuces, and all those curly vegetables,
they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry.
And so in some sense they literally,
they had such a symbolic view of mathematics,
they couldn't actually see what was going on
on the lettuce in front of them.
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders.
that there is an infinite taxonomy
of crochet hyperbolic creatures.
We started out, Chrissy and I and our contributors,
doing the simple mathematically perfect models.
But we found that when we deviated from the specific
setness of the mathematical code
that underlies it -- the simple algorithm
crochet three, increase one --
when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code,
the models immediately started to look more natural.
And all of our contributors, who are an amazing
collection of people around the world,
do their own embellishments.
As it were, we have this ever-evolving,
crochet taxonomic tree of life.
Just as the morphology
in the DNA code
lead to new things like giraffes, or orchids --
so too, do little embellishments in the crochet code
lead to new and wondrous creatures
in the evolutionary tree of crochet life.
So this project really has
taken on this inner organic life of its own.
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it.
And their individual visions,
and their engagement with this mathematical mode.
But why? What's at stake here? What does it matter?
For Chrissy and I, one of the things that's important here
is that these things suggest
the importance and value of embodied knowledge.
We live in a society
that completely tends to valorize
symbolic forms of representation --
algebraic representations,
equations, codes.
We live in a society that's obsessed
with presenting information in this way,
teaching information in this way.
But through this sort of modality,
crochet, other plastic forms of play --
people can be engaged with the most abstract,
which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space.
But you can do it through playing with material objects.
One of the ways that we've come to think about this
is that what we're trying to do with the Institute for Figuring
and projects like this, we're trying to have
kindergarten for grown-ups.
system of education,
established by a man named Friedrich Froebel,
who was a crystallographer in the 19th century.
He believed that the crystal was the model
for all kinds of representation.
He developed a radical alternative system
of engaging the smallest children
with the most abstract ideas
through physical forms of play.
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right.
The value of education
is something that Froebel championed,
through plastic modes of play.
where we have lots of think tanks,
where great minds go to think about the world.
They write these great symbolic treatises
called books, and papers,
and op-ed articles.
We want to propose, Chrissy and I,
through The Institute for Figuring, another alternative way of doing things,
which is the play tank.
And the play tank, like the think tank,
is a place where people can go
and engage with great ideas.
But what we want to propose,
is that the highest levels of abstraction,
things like mathematics, computing, logic, etc. --
all of this can be engaged with,
not just through purely cerebral algebraic
symbolic methods,
but by literally, physically playing with ideas.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
It's pretty simple. There are nine, sort of, rules
that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing.
Most of them are pretty basic.
very sure success method.
But really, truly -- often you think about
letting go way before your body does.
So hang in there,
and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions.
This is a friction climb, up in Tuolumne Meadows,
in the Yosemite high country.
Friction climbing doesn't have any sort of hard positive edges.
You're climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock.
The most friction you have is when you first put your hand
or your foot on the rock.
And then from that point on, you're basically falling.
So momentum is good. Don't stop.
This is a climb called the Naked Edge,
in El Dorado Canyon, outside of Boulder.
This climber is on the last pitch of it.
He's actually right about where I fell.
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him.
And all the hard pitches are actually below him.
Often what happens is
you're planning so hard for like,
"How do I get through the hardest part? How do I get through the hardest part?"
And then what happens?
You get to the last pitch. It's easy.
And you're completely flamed out. Don't do it.
You have to plan ahead to get to the top.
you have to be able to complete.
This is a climb called the Dike Route,
on Pywjack Dome, up in the Yosemite high country.
The interesting thing about this climb is it's not that hard.
But if you're the leader on it,
at the hardest move, you're looking at about 100 foot fall,
onto some low angle slabs.
So you've got to focus.
You don't want to stop in the middle like
Coleridge's Kubla Kahn.
You've got to keep going.
It's amazing. The best climbers
are the ones that in the most extreme situations
can get their bodies into some position
where they can rest,
regroup, calm themselves, focus,
and keep going.
This is a climb in the Needles, again in California.
you're not focusing on what you're doing.
You're focusing on the consequences of
failing at what you're doing
because any given move should require
all your concentration and thought processes
to execute it effectively.
sort of take it straight on. And they follow the most obvious solution.
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming,
which is a columnar basalt formation
that most of you probably know from "Close Encounters."
With this, typically crack climbers
would put their hands in and their toes in
and just start climbing.
The cracks are too small to get your toes into
so the only way to climb is using your fingertips
in the cracks,
and using opposing pressure
and forcing yourself up.
In the 35 years I've been a climbing guide
and taught on indoor walls, and stuff like that,
the most important thing I've learned
was, guys will always try to do pull-ups.
Beginning guys, it's like, they thrash, they thrash,
they get 15 feet up --
and they can do about 15 pull-ups right --
And then they just flame out.
Women are much more in balance
because they don't have that idea
that they're going to be able to do 100 pull-ups.
They think about how to get the weight over their feet
because it's sort of natural -- they carry you all day long.
So balance is really critical,
and keeping your weight on your feet,
which is your strongest muscle.
I came up with rule number nine after
I actually didn't plan for a fall,
and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib.
Once you get to that point where you know it's going to happen,
you need to start thinking about how you're going to let go
because that is the critical piece
of not getting hurt --
how you're going to fall onto the rope,
or if you're climbing without a rope,
fall to a place where you can actually control the fall.
So don't hang on till the bitter end.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
This is Tim Ferriss circa 1979 A.D. Age two.
You can tell by the power squat, I was a very confident boy --
and not without reason.
I had a very charming routine at the time,
which was to wait until late in the evening
when my parents were decompressing from a hard day's work,
doing their crossword puzzles, watching television.
I would run into the living room, jump up on the couch,
rip the cushions off, throw them on the floor,
scream at the top of my lungs and run out
because I was the Incredible Hulk.
(Laughter)
Obviously, you see the resemblance.
And this routine went on for some time.
My parents found it necessary for peace of mind.
And at noon each day
the campers would go to a pond,
where they had floating docks.
You could jump off the end into the deep end.
I was born premature. I was always very small.
My left lung had collapsed when I was born.
And I've always had buoyancy problems.
So water was something that scared me to begin with.
But I would go in on occasion.
And on one particular day,
the campers were jumping through inner tubes,
They were diving through inner tubes. And I thought this would be great fun.
So I dove through the inner tube,
and the bully of the camp grabbed my ankles.
And I tried to come up for air,
and my lower back hit the bottom of the inner tube.
And I went wild eyed and thought I was going to die.
A camp counselor fortunately came over and separated us.
From that point onward I was terrified of swimming.
That is something that I did not get over.
My inability to swim has been
one of my greatest humiliations and embarrassments.
That is when I realized that I was not the Incredible Hulk.
At age 31 -- that's my age now --
in August I took two weeks to re-examine swimming,
and question all the of the obvious aspects of swimming.
And went from swimming one lap --
so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey,
at about 200 beats per minute heart rate --
I measured it --
to going to Montauk on Long Island,
close to where I grew up,
and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water,
getting out and feeling better than when I went in.
And I came out,
in my Speedos, European style,
feeling like the Incredible Hulk.
the Incredible Hulk, at the end of this presentation.
More specifically, I want you to feel like you're capable
of becoming an excellent long-distance swimmer,
a world-class language learner,
and a tango champion.
And I would like to share my art.
If I have an art, it's deconstructing things
that really scare the living hell out of me.
So, moving onward.
First principles, this is very important.
I find that the best results in life
are often held back by false constructs and untested assumptions.
And the turnaround in swimming came
when a friend of mine said, "I will go a year without any stimulants" --
this is a six-double-espresso-per-day type of guy --
"if you can complete a one kilometer open water race."
So the clock started ticking.
I started seeking out triathletes
because I found that lifelong swimmers often couldn't teach what they did.
I tried kickboards.
My feet would slice through the water like razors,
I wouldn't even move. I would leave demoralized, staring at my feet.
Hand paddles, everything.
Even did lessons with Olympians -- nothing helped.
And then Chris Sacca, who is now a dear friend mine,
had completed an Iron Man with 103 degree temperature,
said, "I have the answer to your prayers."
And he introduced me to
the work of a man named Terry Laughlin
who is the founder of Total Immersion Swimming.
That set me on the road to examining biomechanics.
if any of you are afraid of swimming, or not good at it.
The first is, forget about kicking. Very counterintuitive.
So it turns out that propulsion isn't really the problem.
Kicking harder doesn't solve the problem
because the average swimmer only transfers about three percent
of their energy expenditure into forward motion.
The problem is hydrodynamics.
So what you want to focus on instead
is allowing your lower body to draft behind your upper body,
much like a small car behind a big car on the highway.
And you do that by maintaining a horizontal body position.
The only way you can do that
is to not swim on top of the water.
The body is denser than water. 95 percent of it would be,
at least, submerged naturally.
not swimming, in the case of freestyle,
on your stomach, as many people think, reaching on top of the water.
But actually rotating from streamlined right
to streamlined left,
maintaining that fuselage position as long as possible.
So let's look at some examples. This is Terry.
And you can see that he's extending his right arm
below his head and far in front.
And so his entire body really is underwater.
The arm is extended below the head.
The head is held in line with the spine,
so that you use strategic water pressure to raise your legs up --
very important, especially for people with lower body fat.
Here is an example of the stroke.
So you don't kick. But you do use a small flick.
You can see this is the left extension.
Then you see his left leg.
Small flick, and the only purpose of that
is to rotate his hips so he can get to the opposite side.
And the entry point for his right hand -- notice this,
he's not reaching in front and catching the water.
Rather, he is entering the water
at a 45-degree angle with his forearm,
and then propelling himself by streamlining -- very important.
Incorrect, above, which is what almost every swimming coach will teach you.
Not their fault, honestly.
And I'll get to implicit versus explicit in a moment.
Below is what most swimmers
will find enables them to do what I did,
which is going from 21 strokes per 20-yard length
to 11 strokes
in two workouts with no coach, no video monitoring.
And now I love swimming. I can't wait to go swimming.
I'll be doing a swimming lesson later, for myself, if anyone wants to join me.
In freestyle, easiest way to remedy this is
to turn with body roll,
and just to look at your recovery hand as it enters the water.
And that will get you very far.
That's it. That's really all you need to know.
I, like many people, came to the conclusion
that I was terrible at languages.
I suffered through Spanish for junior high, first year of high school,
and the sum total of my knowledge
was pretty much, "Donde esta el bano?"
And I wouldn't even catch the response. A sad state of affairs.
Then I transferred to a different school sophomore year, and
I had a choice of other languages. Most of my friends were taking Japanese.
So I thought why not punish myself? I'll do Japanese.
Six months later I had the chance to go to Japan.
My teachers assured me, they said, "Don't worry.
You'll have Japanese language classes every day to help you cope.
It will be an amazing experience." My first overseas experience in fact.
So my parents encouraged me to do it. I left.
I couldn't believe I was on the other side of the world.
I met my host family. Things went quite well I think,
all things considered.
My first evening, before my first day of school,
I said to my mother, very politely,
"Please wake me up at eight a.m."
So, (Japanese)
But I didn't say (Japanese). I said, (Japanese). Pretty close.
But I said, "Please rape me at eight a.m."
(Laughter)
You've never seen a more confused Japanese woman.
(Laughter)
And a teacher came up to me and handed me a piece of paper.
I couldn't read any of it -- hieroglyphics, it could have been --
because it was Kanji,
Chinese characters adapted into the Japanese language.
Asked him what this said.
And he goes, "Ahh, okay okay,
eehto, World History, ehh, Calculus,
Traditional Japanese." And so on.
And so it came to me in waves.
There had been something lost in translation.
The Japanese classes were not Japanese instruction classes, per se.
They were the normal high school curriculum for Japanese students --
the other 4,999 students in the school, who were Japanese, besides the American.
And that's pretty much my response.
(Laughter)
I tried everything. I went to Kinokuniya.
I tried every possible book, every possible CD.
Nothing worked until I found this.
This is the Joyo Kanji. This is a Tablet rather,
or a poster of the 1,945 common-use characters
as determined by the Ministry of Education in 1981.
Many of the publications in Japan limit themselves to these characters,
to facilitate literacy -- some are required to.
And this became my Holy Grail, my Rosetta Stone.
I took off.
I ended up being able to read Asahi Shinbu, Asahi newspaper,
about six months later -- so a total of 11 months later --
and went from Japanese I to Japanese VI.
Ended up doing translation work at age 16 when I returned to the U.S.,
and have continued to apply this material
over method approach to close to a dozen languages now.
Someone who was terrible at languages,
and at any given time, speak, read and write five or six.
This brings us to the point,
which is, it's oftentimes what you do,
not how you do it, that is the determining factor.
This is the difference between being effective -- doing the right things --
and being efficient -- doing things well whether or not they're important.
I came up with these six sentences after much experimentation.
Having a native speaker allow you to deconstruct their grammar,
by translating these sentences into past, present, future,
will show you subject, object, verb,
placement of indirect, direct objects, gender and so forth.
From that point, you can then, if you want to,
acquire multiple languages, alternate them so there is no interference.
We can talk about that if anyone in interested.
And now I love languages.
very important.
You might look at me and say, "That guy must be a ballroom dancer."
But no, you'd be wrong
because my body is very poorly designed for most things --
pretty well designed for lifting heavy rocks perhaps.
I used to be much bigger, much more muscular.
And so I ended up walking like this.
I looked a lot like an orangutan, our close cousins, or the Incredible Hulk.
Not very good for ballroom dancing.
decided to watch a tango class -- had no intention of participating.
Went in, paid my ten pesos,
walked up -- 10 women two guys, usually a good ratio.
The instructor says, "You are participating."
Immediately: death sweat.
(Laughter)
Fight-or-flight fear sweat, because I tried ballroom dancing in college --
stepped on the girl's foot with my heel. She screamed.
I was so concerned with her perception of what I was doing,
that it exploded in my face,
never to return to the ballroom dancing club.
She comes up, and this was her approach, the teacher.
"Okay, come on, grab me."
Gorgeous assistant instructor.
She was very pissed off that I had pulled her from her advanced practice.
So I did my best. I didn't know where to put my hands.
And she pulled back, threw down her arms,
put them on her hips, turned around and yelled across the room,
"This guy is built like a god-damned mountain of muscle,
and he's grabbing me like a fucking Frenchman,"
(Laughter)
which I found encouraging.
(Laughter)
Everyone burst into laughter. I was humiliated.
She came back. She goes, "Come on. I don't have all day."
As someone who wrestled since age eight, I proceeded to crush her,
"Of Mice and Men" style.
And she looked up and said,
"Now that's better."
So I bought a month's worth of classes.
(Laughter)
I wanted to set competition so I'd have a deadline --
Parkinson's Law,
the perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allot it.
So I had a very short deadline for a competition.
I got a female instructor first,
to teach me the female role, the follow,
because I wanted to understand the sensitivities and abilities
that the follow needed to develop, so I wouldn't have a repeat of college.
And then I took an inventory of the characteristics,
along with her, of the
of the capabilities and elements of different dancers who'd won championships.
I interviewed these people because they all taught in Buenos Aires.
I compared the two lists,
and what you find is that there is explicitly,
expertise they recommended, certain training methods.
Then there were implicit commonalities
that none of them seemed to be practicing.
Now the protectionism of Argentine dance teachers aside,
I found this very interesting. So I decided to focus on three of those commonalities.
Long steps. So a lot of milongueros --
the tango dancers will use very short steps.
I found that longer steps were much more elegant.
So you can have --
and you can do it in a very small space in fact.
Secondly, different types of pivots.
Thirdly, variation in tempo.
These seemed to be the three areas that I could exploit to compete
if I wanted to comptete against people who'd been practicing for 20 to 30 years.
semi-finals of the Buenos Aires championships, four months later.
Then one month later, went to the world championships,
made it to the semi-final. And then set a world record, following that,
two weeks later.
I want you to see part of what I practiced.
I'm going to jump forward here.
This is the instructor that Alicia and I chose for the male lead.
His name is Gabriel Misse.
One of the most elegant dancers of his generation,
known for his long steps, and his tempo changes
and his pivots.
Alicia, in her own right, very famous.
So I think you'll agree, they look quite good together.
Now what I like about this video
is it's actually a video of the first time they ever danced together
because of his lead. He had a strong lead.
He didn't lead with his chest, which requires you lean forward.
I couldn't develop the attributes in my toes,
the strength in my feet, to do that.
So he uses a lead that focuses on
his shoulder girdle and his arm.
So he can lift the woman to break her, for example.
That's just one benefit of that.
So then we broke it down.
This would be an example of one pivot.
This is a back step pivot.
There are many different types.
I have hundreds of hours of footage --
all categorized, much like George Carlin
categorized his comedy.
So using my arch-nemesis,
Spanish, no less, to learn tango.
Sometimes it shows you what you shouldn't do.
More often than not it shows you exactly what you should do.
And the best results that I've had in life,
the most enjoyable times, have all been from asking a simple question:
what's the worst that can happen?
Especially with fears you gained when you were a child.
Take the analytical frameworks,
the capabilities you have, apply them to old fears.
Apply them to very big dreams.
When I imagine my life,
what my life would have been like
without the educational opportunities that I had,
it makes me wonder.
I've spent the last two years trying to deconstruct
the American public school system,
to either fix it or replace it.
And have done experiments with about 50,000 students thus far --
built, I'd say, about a half dozen schools,
my readers, at this point.
And if any of you are interested in that,
I would love to speak with you.
I know nothing. I'm a beginner.
But I ask a lot of questions, and I would love your advice.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The AlloSphere: it's a three-story metal sphere
in an echo-free chamber.
Think of the AlloSphere as a large,
dynamically varying digital microscope
that's connected to a supercomputer.
20 researchers can stand on a bridge
suspended inside of the sphere, and be
completely immersed in their data.
could stand inside of an atom
and watch and hear electrons spin.
Imagine if a group of sculptors
could be inside of a lattice of atoms
and sculpt with their material.
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly
into the brain, as though it was a world,
and see tissues as landscapes,
and hear blood density levels as music.
This is some of the research that you're going to see
that we're undertaking at the AlloSphere.
of artists, scientists, and engineers
that are working together.
I'm a composer, orchestrally-trained,
and the inventor of the AlloSphere.
With my visual artist colleagues, we map
complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space,
visually and sonically.
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns
in the information.
And our engineering colleagues are making
one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world
for this kind of data exploration.
I'm going to fly you into five research projects
in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from
biological macroscopic data
all the way down to electron spin.
And it's our attempt to quantify beauty
by finding which regions of the brain
are interactive while witnessing something beautiful.
You're flying through the cortex of my colleague's brain.
Our narrative here is real fMRI data
that's mapped visually and sonically.
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with.
You see 12 intelligent computer agents,
the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you.
They're mining blood density levels.
And they're reporting them back to you sonically.
Higher density levels mean
more activity in that point of the brain.
They're actually singing these densities to you
with higher pitches mapped to higher densities.
to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature
in our next artistic and scientific installation.
In this artistic and scientific installation, biogenerative algorithms
are helping us to understand
self-generation and growth:
very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences.
For artists, we're making new worlds
that we can uncover and explore.
These generative algorithms grow over time,
and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects.
Our researchers are interacting with this data
by injecting bacterial code,
which are computer programs,
that allow these creatures to grow over time.
We're going to move now from the biological
and the macroscopic world,
down into the atomic world,
as we fly into a lattice of atoms.
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data
from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center.
They've discovered a new bond,
a new material for transparent solar cells.
oxygen, hydrogen and zinc.
You view the bond in the triangle.
It's four blue zinc atoms
bonding with one white hydrogen atom.
You see the electron flow with the streamlines
we as artists have generated for the scientists.
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms.
We think it makes a beautiful structural art.
The sound that you're hearing are the actual
emission spectrums of these atoms.
We've mapped them into the audio domain,
so they're singing to you.
Oxygen, hydrogen and zinc have their own signature.
We're going to actually move even further down
as we go from this lattice of atoms
to one single hydrogen atom.
that have given us the mathematical calculations
of the n-dimensional Schrödinger equation in time.
What you're seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron
in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom.
You're actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines.
The white dots are the probability wave
that will show you where the electron is
in any given point of time and space
in this particular three-orbital configuration.
In a minute we're going to move to a two-orbital configuration,
and you're going to notice a pulsing.
And you're going to hear an undulation between the sound.
This is actually a light emitter.
As the sound starts to pulse and contract,
our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted.
in these calculations.
And they're understanding more about quantum mathematics.
We're going to move even further down,
and go to one single electron spin.
This will be the final project that I show you.
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation
and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers
decoherence in a single electron spin.
We've taken this information and we've
made a mathematical model out of it.
You're actually seeing and hearing
quantum information flow.
This is very important for the next step in simulating
quantum computers and information technology.
give you an idea of the kind of work that we're doing
at the University of California, Santa Barbara,
to bring together, arts, science
and engineering
into a new age of math, science and art.
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere.
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use
this unique instrument that we've created at Santa Barbara.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The future of life, where the unraveling of our biology --
and bring up the lights a little bit. I don't have any slides.
I'm just going to talk --
about where that's likely to carry us.
of the first couple of sessions.
It almost made me feel a little bit guilty about having an uplifting talk
about the future.
It felt wrong to do that in some way.
And yet, I don't really think it is
because when it comes down to it,
it's this larger trajectory that is really what is going to remain --
what people in the future are going to remember about this period.
why the visions of Jeremy Rivkins,
who would like to ban these sorts of technologies,
or of the Bill Joys who would like to relinquish them,
are actually -- to follow those paths would be such a tragedy for us.
I'm focusing on biology,
the biological sciences.
The reason I'm doing that is because those are going to be
the areas that are the most significant to us.
The reason for that is really very simple.
It's because we're flesh and blood.
We're biological creatures.
And what we can do with our biology
is going to shape our future
and that of our children and that of their children --
whether we gain control over aging,
whether we learn to protect ourselves from Alzheimer's,
and heart disease, and cancer.
And I'm actually going to use his words in the same order that he did.
(Laughter)
He said, "And so from hour to hour
we ripe and ripe.
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot.
And thereby hangs a tale."
Life is short, you know.
And we need to think about planning a little bit.
We're all going to eventually, even in the developed world,
going to have to lose everything that we love.
When you're beginning to rot a little bit,
all of the videos crammed into your head,
all of the extensions that extend your various powers,
are going to being to seem a little secondary.
And you know, I'm getting a little bit gray -- so is Ray Kurzweil,
so is Eric Drexler.
Now I know there's been a whole lot of hype
about our power to control biology.
You just have to look at the Human Genome Project.
It wasn't two years ago
that everybody was talking about --
we've found the Holy Grail of biology.
We're deciphering the code of codes.
We're reading the book of life.
It's a little bit reminiscent of 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the moon,
and everybody was about to race out toward the stars.
And we've all seen "2001: A Space Odyssey."
You know it's 2003, and there is no HAL.
And there is no odyssey to our own moon, much less the moons of Jupiter.
And we're still picking up pieces of the Challenger.
So it's not surprising that some people would wonder
whether maybe 30 or 40 years from now,
we'll look back at this instant in time,
and all of the sort of talk about
the Human Genome Project,
and what all this is going to mean to us --
well, it will really mean precious little.
And I just want to say that that is absolutely not going to be the case.
Because when we talk about our genetics and our biology,
and modifying and altering and adjusting these things,
we're talking about changing ourselves.
And this is very critical stuff.
you just have to go to any major city.
This is not the stomping ground
of our Pleistocene ancestors.
What's happening is we're taking this technology --
it's becoming more precise, more potent --
and we're turning it back upon ourselves.
Before it's all done
we are going to alter ourselves
every bit as much as we have changed the world around us.
It's going to happen a lot sooner
than people imagine.
On the way there it's going to
completely revolutionize medicine and health care; that's obvious.
It's going to change the way we have children.
It's going to change the way we manage
and alter our emotions.
It's going to probably change the human lifespan.
It will really make us question
what it is to be a human being.
two unprecedented revolutions that are going on today.
The first of them is the obvious one,
the silicon revolution,
which you all are very, very familiar with.
It's changing our lives in so many ways,
and it will continue to do that.
What the essence of that is, is that we're taking
the sand at our feet, the inert silicon at our feet,
and we're breathing a level of complexity into it
that rivals that of life itself,
and may even surpass it.
As an outgrowth of that, as a child of that revolution,
is the revolution in biology.
proteomics, metabolomics, all of these "omics"
that sound so terrific on grants and on business plans.
What we're doing is we are
seizing control of our evolutionary future.
I mean we're essentially using technology
to just jam evolution into fast-forward.
It's not at all clear where it's going to take us.
But in five to ten years we're going to start see
some very profound changes.
The most immediate changes that we'll see
are things like in medicine.
There is going to be a big shift towards preventative medicine
as we start to be able to identify
all of the risk factors that we have as individuals.
But who is going to pay for all this?
And how are we going to understand all this complex information?
That is going to be the IT challenge
of the next generation, is communicating all this information.
and genetics:
tailoring drugs to our individual constitutions
that Juan talked about a little bit earlier.
That's going to have amazing impacts.
And it's going to be used for diet as well,
and nutritional supplements and such.
But it's going to have a big impact because
we're going to have niche drugs.
And we aren't going to be able to support
the kinds of expenses that we have to create blockbuster drugs today.
The approval process is going to fall apart, actually.
It's too slow.
It's too risk-averse.
And it is really not suited for the future
that we're moving into.
It's really wonderful when we hear,
"Oh, 99.9 percent of the letters in the code are the same.
We're all identical to each other. Isn't it wonderful?"
And look around you and know
that what we really care about is
that little bit of difference.
We look the same to a visitor from another planet, maybe,
but not to each other
because we compete with each other all time.
And we're going to have to come to grips with the fact
that there are differences between us as individuals that we will know about,
and between subpopulations of humans as well.
To deny that that's the case is not a very good start on that.
there are going to be even more profound things that are going to happen.
That's when we're going to begin to use this knowledge to modify ourselves.
Now I don't mean extra gills or something --
something we care about, like aging.
What if we could unravel aging and understand it --
begin to retard the process or even reverse it?
It would change absolutely everything.
And it's obvious to anyone,
that if we can do this, we absolutely will do this,
whatever the consequences are.
I mean Ritalin, Viagra,
things of that sort, Prozac.
You know, this is just clumsy little baby steps.
What if you could take a little
concoction of pharmaceuticals
that would make you feel really contented,
just happy to be you.
Are you going to be able to resist that if it doesn't have any overt side effects?
Probably not.
And if you don't, who are you going to be?
Why do you do what you do?
We're sort of circumventing evolutionary programs that guide our behavior.
It's going to be very challenging to deal with.
The idea that we're going to chose our children's genes,
as we begin to understand what genes say about who we are.
That's the focus of my book "Redesigning Humans,"
where I talk about the kinds of choices we'll make,
and the challenges it's going to present to society.
There are three obvious ways of doing this.
The first is cloning.
It didn't happen.
It's a total media circus.
It will happen in five to 10 years.
And when it does it's not going to be that big a deal.
The birth of a delayed identical twin
is not going to shake western civilization.
embryo screening.
You take a six to eight cell embryo,
you tease out one of the cells, you run a genetic test on that cell,
and depending on the results of that test
you either implant that embryo or you discard it.
It's already done to avoid rare diseases today.
And pretty soon it's going to be possible
to avoid virtually all genetic diseases in that way.
As that becomes possible
this is going to move from something that is used by those who
have infertility problems and are already doing in vitro fertilization,
to the wealthy who want to protect their children,
to just about everybody else.
And in that process that's going to morph
from being just for diseases,
to being for lesser vulnerabilities,
like risk of manic depression or something,
to picking personalities,
temperaments, traits, these sorts of things.
Of course there is going to be genetic engineering.
Directly going in -- it's a little bit further away, but not that far away --
going in and altering the genes in the first cell in an embryo.
The way I suspect it will happen
is using artificial chromosomes
and extra chromosomes, so we go from 46
to 47 or 48.
And one that is not heritable
because who would want to pass on to their children
the archaic enhancement modules
that they got 25 years earlier from their parents?
It's a joke; of course they wouldn't want to do that.
They'll want the new release.
(Laughter)
computers, and with programming,
are actually much deeper than that.
They are really going to come to operate in this realm.
Now not everything that can be done should be done.
And it won't be done.
But when something is feasible in thousands of
laboratories all over the world,
which is going to be the case with these technologies,
when there are large numbers of people who see them as beneficial,
which is already the case,
and when they're almost impossible to police,
it's not a question of if this is going to happen,
it's when and where and how it's going to happen.
And it's going to do so for two reasons.
The first is that all these technologies
are just a spin-off of mainstream medical research
that everybody wants to see happen.
It is being funded very very --
in a big way.
The second is, we're human.
That's what we do.
We try and use our technology to
improve our lives in one way or another.
To imagine that we're not going to use these technologies
when they become available,
is as much a denial of who we are
as to imagine
that we'll use these technologies and not fret
and worry about it a great deal.
The lines are going to blur. And they already are
between therapy and enhancement,
between treatment and prevention,
between need and desire.
That's really the central one, I believe.
They undoubtedly will. They have.
But ultimately all this is going to do
is just shift development elsewhere.
It's going to drive these things from view.
It's going to reserve the technology for the wealthy
because they are in the best position
to circumvent any of these sorts of laws.
And it's going to deny us
the information that we need to make wise decisions
about how to use these technologies.
So, sure, we need to debate these things.
And I think it's wonderful that we do.
But we shouldn't kid ourselves
and think that we're going to reach a consensus about these things.
That is simply not going to happen.
They touch us too deeply.
And they depend too much upon history, upon philosophy,
upon religion, upon culture, upon politics.
Some people are going to see this
as an abomination,
as the worst thing, as just awful.
Other people are going to say, "This is great.
This is the flowering of human endeavor."
about these sorts of technologies,
is that it's easy to become seduced by them.
And to focus too much on all
the high-technology possibilities that exist.
And to lose touch
with the basic rhythms of our biology and our health.
There are too many people that think that high-technology medicine
is going to keep them, save them,
from overeating,
from eating a lot of fast foods,
from not getting any exercise.
It's not going to happen.
and all these things that are occurring, it's really interesting
because there is sort of a counter-revolution that is going on:
a resurgence of interest in remedies from the past,
in nutraceuticals, in all of these sorts of things
that some people, in the pharmaceutical industry particularly,
like to brand as non-science.
But this whole effort is generated,
is driven, by IT as well
because that is how we're gathering all this information,
and linking it, and integrating it together.
There is a lot in this rich biota that is going to serve us well.
And that's where about half of our drugs come.
So we shouldn't dismiss this
because it's an enormous opportunity to use
these sorts of results,
or these random loose trials from the last thousand years
about what has impacts on our health.
And to use our advanced technologies
to pull out what is beneficial from this
sea of noise, basically.
I just formed a biotechnology company
that is using
this sort of an approach to develop
therapeutics for Alzheimer's and other diseases of aging,
and we're making some real progress.
So here we are.
It's the beginning of a new millennium.
If you look forward,
I mean future humans,
far before the end of this millennium,
in a few hundred years, they are going to look back at this moment.
And from the beginning of today's sessions
you'd think that they're going to see this as this horrible
difficult, painful period
that we struggled through.
And I don't think that's what's going to happen.
They're going to do like everybody does. They are going to forget about all that stuff.
And they are actually going to romanticize this moment in time.
They are going to think about it
as this glorious instant
when we laid down
the very foundations of their lives,
of their society, of their future.
You know it's a little bit like a birth.
Where there is this bloody, awful mess happens.
And then what comes out of it? New life.
Actually as was pointed out earlier,
we forget about all the struggle there was in getting there.
it's clear that one of the foundations of that future
is going to be the reworking of our biology.
It's going to come gradually at first. It's going to pick up speed.
We're going to make lots of errors.
That's the way these things work.
To me it's an incredible privilege
to be alive now
and to be able to witness this thing.
It is something that is a unique instant
in the history of all of life.
It will always be remembered.
And what's extraordinary is that
we're not just observing this,
we are the architects of this.
I think that we should be proud of it.
What is so difficult and challenging
is that we are also the objects of these changes.
It's our health, it's our lives, it's our future, it's our children.
And that is why they are so very troubling to so many people
who would pull back in fear.
I think that our choice
in the choice of life,
is not whether we're going to go down this path.
We are, definitely.
It's how we hold it in our hearts.
It's how we look at it.
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly
in 430 B.C. He put it nicely.
Again, I'll use the words in the same order he did.
"The bravest are surely those
who have the clearest vision of what is before them,
both glory and danger alike.
And yet notwithstanding, they go out and they meet it."
(Applause)
in the middle of a Davos afternoon about four years ago.
It never left my brain.
And I started playing with it more like a puzzle.
The original thought I had: this must be ethanol.
So I went out and researched ethanol,
and found out you need the Amazon in your backyard in every country.
About six months later I figured out it must be hydrogen,
until some scientist told me the unfortunate truth,
which is, you actually use more
clean electrons than the ones you get
inside a car, if you use hydrogen.
So that is not going to be the path to go.
wandering around, I got to the thought
that actually if you could convert an entire country to electric cars,
in a way that is convenient and affordable,
you could get to a solution.
Now I started this from a point of view that
it has to be something that scales en masse.
Not how do you build one car,
but how do you scale this so that it can become
something that is used by 99 percent of the population?
The thought that came to mind is that it needs to be as good
as any car that you would have today.
So one, it has to be more convenient than a car.
And two, it has be more affordable than today's cars.
Affordable is not a 40,000 dollar sedan, right?
Alright? That's not something that we can finance or buy today.
And convenient is not something that you drive for an hour and charge for eight.
and the laws of economics.
And so the thought that I started with was
how do you do this, still within the boundary
of the science we know today --
no time for science fair, no time for playing around with things
or waiting for the magic battery to show up.
How do you do it within the economics that we have today?
How do you do it from the power of the consumer up?
And not from the power of an edict down.
I actually found out that the answer comes
from separating between the car ownership
and the battery ownership.
In a sense if you want to think about it this is the classic
"batteries not included."
Now if you separate between the two,
you could actually answer the need for a convenient car
by creating a network,
by creating a network before the cars show up.
The network has two components in them.
First component is you charge the car whenever you stop --
ends up that cars are these strange beasts that drive
for about two hours and park for about 22 hours.
If you drive a car in the morning and drive it back in the afternoon
the ratio of charge to drive is about a minute for a minute.
And so the first thought that came to mind is,
everywhere we park we have electric power.
Now it sounds crazy. But in some places around the world,
like Scandinavia, you already have that.
If you park your car and didn't plug in the heater,
when you come back you don't have a car. It just doesn't work.
last foot, in a sense,
is the first step of the infrastructure.
The second step of the infrastructure needs to take care
of the range extension.
See we're bound by today's technology on batteries,
which is about 120 miles if you want to stay within
reasonable space and weight limitations.
120 miles is a good enough range for a lot of people.
But you never want to get stuck.
So what we added is a second element to our network,
which is a battery swap system.
You drive. You take your depleted battery out.
A full battery comes on. And you drive on.
You don't do it as a human being. You do it as a machine.
It looks like a car wash. You come into your car wash.
And a plate comes up, holds your battery, takes it out, puts it back in, and
within two minutes you're back on the road
and you can go again.
If you had charge spots everywhere,
and you had battery swap stations everywhere,
how often would you do it? And it ends up
that you'd do swapping less times than you stop at a gas station.
As a matter of fact, we added to the contract.
We said that if you stop to swap your battery more than 50 times a year
we start paying you money
because it's an inconvenience.
We looked at the question, what happens when the battery is
disconnected from the car.
What is the cost of that battery?
Everybody tells us batteries are so expensive.
What we found out, when you move from molecules to electrons,
something interesting happens.
We can go back to the original economics of the car and look at it again.
The battery is not the gas tank, in a sense.
Remember in your car you have a gas tank.
You have the crude oil.
And you have refining and delivery of that crude oil
as what we call petrol or gasoline.
The battery in this sense, is the crude oil.
We have a battery bay. It costs the same hundred dollars
as the gas tank.
But the crude oil is replaced with a battery.
Just it doesn't burn. It consumes itself
step after step after step.
It has 2,000 life cycles these days.
And so it's sort of a mini well.
We were asked in the past when we bought an electric car
to pay for the entire well, for the life of the car.
Nobody wants to buy a mini well when they buy a car.
In a sense what we've done is
we've created a new consumable.
And we created electric miles.
And the price of electric miles ends up being a very interesting number.
Today 2010, in volume,
when we come to market, it is eight cents a mile.
Those of you who have a hard time calculating what that means --
in the average consumer
environment we're in in the U.S.
20 miles per gallon that's a buck 50, a buck 60 a gallon.
That's cheaper than today's gasoline, even in the U.S.
In Europe where taxes are in place,
that's the equivalent to a minus 60 dollar barrel.
But e-miles follow Moore's Law.
They go from eight cents a mile in 2010,
to four cents a mile in 2015,
to two cents a mile by 2020.
Why? Because batteries life cycle improve --
a bit of improvement on energy density, which reduces the price.
And these prices are actually with clean electrons.
We do not use any electrons that come from coal.
So in a sense this is
an absolute zero-carbon, zero-fossil fuel
electric mile at two cents a mile by 2020.
Now even if we get to 40 miles per gallon
by 2020, which is our desire.
Imagine only 40 miles per gallon cars would be on the road.
That is an 80 cent gallon.
An 80 cent gallon means, if the entire Pacific
would convert to crude oil,
and we'd let any oil company bring it out and refine it,
they still can't compete with two cents a mile.
That's a new economic factor,
which is fascinating to most people.
That's how I solved it in my head. It was a white paper I handed out to governments.
And some governments told me that it's fascinating
that the younger generation actually thinks about these things.
(Laughter)
Until I got to the
true young global leader, Shimon Peres, President of Israel,
and he ran a beautiful manipulation on me.
First he let me go to the prime minister of the country,
who told me, if you can find the money you need for this network,
200 million dollars,
and if you can find a car company
that will build that car in mass volume,
in two million cars -- that's what we needed in Israel --
I'll give you country to invest the 200 million into.
Peres thought that was a great idea.
We sent letters to all the car companies.
Three of them never showed up. One of them asked us
if we would stay with hybrids and they would give us a discount.
But one of them Carlos Ghosn, CEO of Renault and Nissan,
when asked about hybrids said something very fascinating.
He said hybrids are like mermaids.
When you want a fish you get a woman and
when you need a woman you get a fish.
(Laughter)
And Ghosn came up and said,
"I have the car, Mr. Peres; I will build you the cars."
And actually true to form, Renault has put a billion and a half dollars
in building nine different types of cars that fit this kind of model
that will come into the market in mass volume --
mass volume being the first year, 100 thousand cars.
It's the first mass-volume electric car,
zero-emission electric car in the market.
I was running, as Chris said,
to be the CEO of a large software company called SAP
And then Peres said, "Well won't you run this project?"
And I said, "I'm ready for CEO" And he said,
"Oh no no no no no. You've got to explain to me,
what is more important than saving your country and saving the world,
that you would go and do?"
We then decided to scale it up.
We went to other countries. As I said we went to Denmark.
And Denmark set this beautiful policy;
it's called the IQ test.
It's inversely proportional to taxes.
They put 180 percent tax on gasoline cars
and zero tax on zero-emission cars.
So if you want to buy a gasoline car in Denmark, it costs you about 60,000 Euros.
If you buy our car it's about 20,000 Euros.
If you fail the IQ test they ask you to leave the country.
(Laughter)
who run only in small islands.
I know most people don't think of Israel as a small island,
but Israel is an island -- it's a transportation island.
If your car is driving outside Israel it's been stolen.
(Laughter)
If you're thinking about it in terms of islands,
we decided to go to the biggest island that we could find,
and that was Australia. The third country we announced was Australia.
It's got three centers --
in Brisbane, in Melbourne, in Sydney --
and one freeway, one electric freeway that connects them.
The next island
was not too hard to find, and that was Hawaii.
We decided to come into the U.S.
and pick the two best places --
the one where you didn't need any range extension.
Hawaii you can drive around the island on one battery.
And if you really have a long day you can switch,
and keep on driving around the island.
where Gavin Newsom created a beautiful policy across all the mayors.
He decided that he's going to take over
the state, unofficially, and then officially,
and then created this beautiful Region One policy.
In the San Francisco Bay Area not only do you have
the highest concentration of Priuses,
but you also have the perfect range extender.
It's called the other car.
As we stared scaling it up
we looked at what is the problem to come up to the U.S.?
Why is this a big issue?
And the most fascinating thing we've learned is that,
when you have small problems on the individual level,
like the price of gasoline to drive every morning.
You don't notice it, but when the aggregate comes up
you're dead. Alright?
lots of other curves that we've seen,
goes along a depletion curve.
The foundation of this curve is that we keep losing the wells that are close to the ground.
And we keep getting wells that are farther away from the ground.
It becomes more and more and more expensive to dig them out.
You think, well it's been up, it's been down,
its been up, it's going to keep on going up and down.
Here is the problem:
at 147 dollars a barrel, which we were in six months ago,
the U.S. spent a ton of money to get oil.
Then we lost our economy and we went back down to 47 --
sometimes it's 40, sometimes it's 50.
Now we're running a stimulus package.
It's called the trillion-dollar stimulus package.
We're going to revive the economy. Hopefully it happens between now and 2015,
somewhere in that space.
What happens when the economy recovers?
By 2015 we would have had at least 250 million new cars
even at the pace we're going at right now.
That's another 30 percent demand on oil.
That is another 25 million barrels a day.
That's all the U.S. usage today.
In other words at some point when we've recovered we go up to the peak.
And then we do the OPEC stimulus package
also known as 200 dollars a barrel.
We take our money and we give it away.
You know what happens at that point?
We go back down. It's going to go up and down.
And the downs are going to be much longer
and the ups are going to be much shorter.
like CO2, which we go slowly up and then we tip,
and problems that are depletive,
in which we lose what we have,
which oscillate, and they oscillate until
we lose everything we've got.
Now we actually looked at what the answer would be.
Right? Remember in the campaign: one million
hybrid cars by 2015.
That is 0.5 percent of the U.S. oil consumption.
That is oh point oh well percent of the rest of the world.
That won't do much difference.
ten million electric cars on the global roads.
Ten million out of 500 million we will add between now and then.
That is the most pessimistic number you can have.
It's also the most optimistic number
because it means we will scale this industry
from 100 thousand cars is 2011,
to 10 million cars by 2016 --
100 x growth in less than five years.
You have to remember that the world today is bringing in so many cars.
We have 10 million cars by region.
That's an enormous amount of cars.
India, Russia, Brazil.
We have all these regions.
Europe has solved it. They just put a tax on gasoline.
They'll be the first in line to get off
because their prices are high.
China solves it by an edict. At some point they'll just declare
that no gasoline car will come into a city, and that will be it.
The Indians don't even understand why we think of it as a problem
because most people in India fill two or three gallons every time.
For them to get a battery that goes 120 miles
is an extension on range, not a reduction in range.
We're the only ones who don't have the price set right.
We don't have the industry set right.
We don't have any incentive to go and resolve it
across the U.S.
Very interesting. The car industry has been focused just on themselves.
They basically looked at it and said, "Car 1.0
we'll solve everything within the car itself."
No infrastructure, no problem.
We forgot about the entire chain around us.
All this stuff that happens around.
We are looking at the emergence of a car 2.0 --
a whole new market, a whole new business model.
The business model in which the money that is actually coming in,
to drive the car --
the minutes, the miles if you want,
that you are all familiar with --
subsidize the price of the car,
just like cellphones. You'll pay for the miles.
And some of it will go back to the car maker.
Some of it will go back to your own pocket.
But our cars are actually going to be cheaper than gasoline cars.
In Denmark, we will drive all the cars in Denmark
from windmills, not from oil.
In Israel, we've asked to put a solar farm
in the south of Israel.
And people said, "Oh that's a very very large space that you're asking for."
And we said, "What if we had proven that in the same space
we found oil for the country for the next hundred years?"
And they said, "We tried. There isn't any."
We said, "No no, but what if we prove it?"
And they said, "Well you can dig." And we decided to dig up,
instead of digging down.
These are perfect matches to one another.
of the electricity generated.
Think of it as a project that spans over about 10 years.
That's one percent a year.
Now when we're looking at solving big problems,
we need to start thinking in two numbers.
And those are not 20 percent by 2020.
The two numbers are zero -- as in zero footprint or zero oil --
and scale it infinity.
And when we go to COP15 at the end of this year
we can't stop thinking of padding CO2.
We have to start thinking about giving kickers to countries
that are willing to go to this kind of scale.
And actually 700 and change million cars today
emit 2.8 billion tons of CO2.
That's, in the additive, about 25 percent of our problem.
Cars and trucks add up to about 25 percent of the world's CO2 emissions.
We have to come and attack this problem
with a focus, with an effort that actually says,
we're going to go to zero before the world ends.
I actually shared that with some legislators here in the U.S.
I shared it with a gentleman called Bobby Kennedy Jr., who is one of my idols.
I told him one of the reasons that
his uncle was remembered
is because he said we're going to send a man to the moon,
and we'll do it by the end of the decade.
We didn't say we're going to send a man 20 percent to the moon.
And there will be about a 20 percent chance we'll recover him.
(Laughter)
200 years ago, in Parliament, in Great Britain,
there was a long argument
over economy versus morality.
25 percent -- just like 25 percent emissions today comes from cars --
25 percent of their energy
for the entire industrial world in the U.K.
came from a source of energy that was immoral:
human slaves.
And there was an argument. Should we stop using slaves?
And what would it do to our economy?
And people said, "Well we need to take time to do it.
Let's not do it immediately. Maybe we free the kids
and keep the slaves.
And after a month of arguments they decided to stop slavery,
and the industrial revolution started within less than one year.
And the U.K. had 100 years of economic growth.
We have to make the right moral decision.
We have to make it immediately.
We need to have presidential leadership
just like we had in Israel that said we will end oil.
And we need to do it not within 20 years or 50 years,
but within this presidential term
because if we don't, we will lose our economy,
right after we'd lost our morality.
(Applause)
I am going to talk about myself,
And secondly, I'm a recovering narcissist.
So it's actually drearier than self-love;
it's unrequited self-love.
(Laughter)
I don't feel I can afford a relapse.
in a particular form of improvisation called theater games,
And the rule was, you couldn't deny the other person's reality,
you could only build on it.
contradicting other peoples' reality.
It's all about contradiction,
which I think is why I'm so sensitive to contradiction in general.
I see it everywhere.
Like polls. You know, it's always curious to me
that in public opinion polls
the percentage of Americans who don't know the answer to any given question
is always two percent.
75 percent of Americans
think Alaska is part of Canada.
But only two percent don't know the effect
that the debacle in Argentina will have on the IMF's monetary policy --
(Laughter)
seems a contradiction.
Or this ad that I read in the New York Times:
"Wearing a fine watch speaks loudly of your rank in society.
Buying it from us screams good taste."
(Laughter)
Or this that I found in a magazine called California Lawyer,
(Laughter)
"Don't use big words."
(Laughter)
"Learn the lingua franca."
talk about science when I don't know math.
You know, because -- and by the way to I was so grateful to Dean Kamen
for pointing out that one of the reasons,
that there are cultural reasons
that women and minorities don't enter the fields of science and technology --
because for instance, the reason I don't do math is,
I was taught to do math and read at the same time.
So you're six years old, you're reading Snow White and the Seven Dwarves,
and it becomes rapidly obvious
that there are only two kinds of men in the world:
dwarves and Prince Charmings.
And the odds are seven to one against your finding the prince.
(Laughter)
That's why little girls don't do math. It's too depressing.
who were very upset with me.
I used the word postmodern as if it were OK.
in a serious argument.
But I don't engage in serious arguments.
I don't approve of them
because arguments, of course, are all about contradiction,
like rationality. You're supposed to be rational in an argument.
Well rationality is constructed
by what Christie Hefner was talking about today,
that mind-body split, you know?
The head is good, body bad.
Head is ego, body id.
we mean the head.
And as David Lee Roth sang in "Just a Gigolo,"
"I ain't got no body."
is the body asserting itself against the head.
That's why you have toilet humor and sexual humor.
That's why you have the Raspyni Brothers
whacking Richard in the genital area.
And we're laughing doubly then
because he's the body, but it's also --
(Laughter)
like Art Buchwald takes shots at the heads of state.
It doesn't make quite as much money as body humor I'm sure --
(Laughter)
but nevertheless, what makes us treasure you and adore you.
which is, as much as we revere the head,
we are very anti-intellectual.
I know this because I read in the New York Times,
the Ayn Rand foundation took out a full-page ad
after September 11,
in which they said, "The problem is not Iraq or Iran,
the problem in this country, facing this country
is the university professors and their spawn."
(Laughter)
I don't know how many of you have read it.
And I'm not an expert on sadomasochism.
(Laughter)
taking painful contemptuous possession of her,
was the kind of rapture she wanted.
When they lay together in bed it was,
as it had to be, as the nature of the act demanded,
an act of violence.
It was an act of clenched teeth and hatred. It was the unendurable.
Not a caress, but a wave of pain.
The agony as an act of passion."
that Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve,
claims Ayn Rand as his intellectual mentor.
(Laughter)
It's like finding out your nanny is a dominatrix.
(Laughter)
Bad enough we had to see J. Edgar Hoover in a dress.
Now we have to picture Alan Greenspan
is famous for a philosophy called Objectivism,
which reflects another value of Newtonian physics,
which is objectivity.
Objectivity basically is constructed
in that same S&M way.
It's the subject subjugating the object.
That's how you assert yourself.
You make yourself the active voice.
And the object is the passive no-voice.
I don't know if you know this but --
maybe it's different now, or maybe you were making a statement --
but in many hospital nurseries across the country,
until very recently anyway, according to a book by Jessica Benjamin,
the signs over the little boys cribs read,
"I'm a boy,"
and the signs over the little girls cribs read,
"It's a girl." Yeah.
So the passivity was culturally
projected onto the little girls.
There's a poll that proves --
there was a poll that was given by Time magazine,
in which only men were asked, "Have you ever had sex
with a woman you actively disliked?"
And well, yeah.
Well, 58 percent said yes,
which I think is overinflated though
because so many men if you just say,
"Have you ever had sex ... " "Yes!"
They don't even wait for the rest of it.
(Laughter)
And of course two percent did not know whether they'd had --
(Laughter)
That's the first callback,
of my attempted quadruple.
is part of something I'm very interested in
because this is why, frankly, I believe in political correctness.
I do. I think it can go too far.
I think Ringling Brothers may have gone too far
with an ad they took out in the New York Times Magazine.
"We have a lifelong emotional and financial
commitment to our Asian Elephant partners."
(Laughter)
Maybe too far. But you know --
is the same thing as a white person making fun of people of color.
Kenneth Lay and his charming wife.
(Laughter)
What's funny about being down to four houses?
(Laughter)
And I really learned this lesson
during the sex scandals of the Clinton administration or,
When people I knew, you know, people who considered themselves liberal,
and everything else,
were making fun of Jennifer Flowers and Paula Jones.
Basically, they were making fun of them for being
trailer trash or white trash.
It seems, I suppose, a harmless prejudice
and that you're not really hurting anybody.
Until you read, as I did, an ad in the Los Angeles Times.
"For sale: White trash compactor."
(Laughter)
has relevance to humor in this way.
I read a book by a woman named Amy Richlin,
who is the chair of the Classics department at USC.
And the book is called "The Garden of Priapus."
And she says that Roman humor
mirrors the construction of Roman society.
So that Roman society was very top/bottom,
as ours is to some degree.
And so was humor.
There always had to be the butt of a joke.
So it was always the satirist,
like Juvenal or Martial,
represented the audience,
and he was going to make fun of the outsider,
the person who didn't share that subject status.
the stand-up comedian is supposed to dominate the audience.
A lot of heckling is the tension
of trying to make sure that the
comedian is going to be able to dominate,
But I always hated it because they were
dictating the terms of the interaction,
in the same way that engaging in a serious argument
determines the content, to some degree,
of what you're talking about.
And I was looking for a form
that didn't have that.
And so I wanted something that was more interactive.
I know that word is so debased now
by the use of it by Internet marketers.
(Laughter)
He hung up on me!
to shape what you're going to do as much as
you shape their experience of the world.
And that's really what I'm looking for.
And I was sort of, as I was starting to analyze
what exactly it is that I do,
I mean he had laid it all out.
And then coming to this conference,
I realized that most everybody here
shared those same qualities
because really what trickster is
is an agent of change.
Trickster is a change agent.
And the qualities that I'm about to describe
are the qualities that make it possible
to make change happen.
And one of these is boundary crossing.
I think this is what so, in fact, infuriated the scientists.
But I like to cross boundaries.
that you may not be able to see.
Like for instance a mime once --
And he said that I had to show more respect
because it took up to 18 years
to learn how to do mime properly.
And I said, "Well, that's how you know only stupid people go into it."
(Laughter)
It only takes two years to learn how to talk.
quote, objectivity, unquote.
When you're only surrounded by people
who speak the same vocabulary as you,
or share the same set of assumptions as you,
you start to think that that's reality.
Well, look at Michael Hawley,
or look at Dean Kamen,
or look at my grandmother.
whether they wanted her to or not.
(Laughter)
If they had had an Olympics in martyrdom,
my grandmother would have lost on purpose.
(Laughter)
"No, you take the prize.
this go-between which --
Fritz Lanting, is that his name,
actually said that he was a go-between.
And this is instead of contradiction.
Where you deny the other person's reality,
you have paradox
where you allow more than one reality to coexist,
I'm not sure what it's called.
But my example of it is a sign that I saw in a jewelry store.
It said, "Ears pierced while you wait."
(Laughter)
There the alternative just boggles the imagination.
(Laughter)
"Oh no. Thanks though, I'll leave them here. Thanks very much.
I have some errands to run. So I'll be back to pick them up
around five, if that's OK with you.
is smart luck.
That accidents, that Louis Kahn, who talked about accidents,
this is another quality of the trickster.
The trickster has a mind that is prepared for the unprepared.
That, and I will say this to the scientists,
that the trickster has the ability to hold
his ideas lightly
so that he can let room in for new ideas
or to see the contradictions or the hidden problems
with his ideas.
I had no joke for that.
I just wanted to put the scientists in their place.
(Laughter)
and that is in making connections.
This is what I tend to see
almost more than contradictions.
Like the, what do you call those toes of the gecko?
You know, the toes of the gecko,
curling and uncurling like the fingers of Michael Moschen.
I love connections.
of matter in the Newtonian universe --
there are two attributes of matter in the Newtonian universe --
one is space occupancy. Matter takes up space.
I guess the more you matter the more space you take up,
which explains the whole SUV phenomenon.
(Laughter)
And the other one though is impenetrability.
was the criterion of masculinity.
Masculinity depended on you
being the active penetrator.
And then, in economics, there's an active producer
and a passive consumer,
Well yeah, I mean why we forced China
to open her markets.
And didn't that feel good?
(Laughter)
And now we're being penetrated.
You know the biotech companies are actually going inside us
and planting their little flags on our genes.
You know we're being penetrated.
And I suspect, by someone who actively dislikes us.
(Laughter)
That's the second of the quadruple.
Yes of course you got that. Thank you very much.
I still have a way to go.
is short circuit people's thinking.
You know, make you not follow your usual
train of association,
but make you rewire.
It literally -- when people say about the shock of recognition,
it's literally re-cognition, rewiring how you think --
I had a joke to go with this and I forgot it.
I'm so sorry. I'm getting like
the woman in that joke about --
And the mother is elderly.
And the mother goes right through a red light.
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything.
She doesn't want to be like, "You're too old to drive."
And the mother goes through a second red light.
And the daughter says, as tactfully as possible,
"Mom, are you aware that you just went through two red lights?"
And the mother says, "Oh! Am I driving?"
at the shock of recognition.
That completes the quadruple.
One is, another characteristic of trickster
is that the trickster has to
walk this fine line.
He has to have poise.
And you know the biggest hurdle for me,
in doing what I do,
is constructing my performance
so that it's prepared and unprepared.
Finding the balance between those things
is always dangerous
because you might tip off too much in the direction of unprepared.
But being too prepared doesn't leave room
for the accidents to happen.
said yesterday about beauty
because in his book, Hyde says that
sometimes trickster can tip over into beauty.
But to do that you have to
lose all the other qualities
because once you're into beauty
you're into a finished thing.
You're into something that
occupies space and inhabits time.
It's an actual thing.
And it is always extraordinary to see a thing of beauty.
But if you don't do that,
if you allow for the accident to keep on happening,
you have the possibility of getting on a wavelength.
I like to think of what I do as a probability wave.
When you go into beauty the probability wave
collapses into one possibility.
And I like to explore all the possibilities
in the hope that you'll be on the wavelength of your audience.
that he doesn't have a home.
He's always on the road.
I want to say to you Richard, in closing,
that in TED you've created a home.
And thank you for inviting me into it.
Thank you very much.
They just grow and divide and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life,
and all of the circles in that man are all the cells that make up your body.
And, of course, it's the DNA that counts,
These are incredibly important; they keep us alive.
They cover us in an invisible body armor
They digest our food, they make our vitamins,
and they never get any press for that.
And so it seemed to us that they're just too small
to have an impact on the environment
if they simply act as individuals.
like fireflies make light.
We're not doing anything to the cells here,
but when the bacteria made light.
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone,
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules
that you can think of like hormones,
increases in proportion to cell number.
they recognize that molecule
and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony.
They live in there, at high cell number.
And it opens and closes the shutter
so the amount of light coming out of the bottom,
which is made by the bacterium,
and they turn on group behaviors
that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison.
that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions.
is they get in you, they wait, they start growing,
they count themselves with these little molecules,
they're going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host.
These were the red triangles on my slides before.
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule.
This is the word that it talks with.
And then we started to look at other bacteria,
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical
in every single species of bacteria.
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin.
And so we started to think, if this really is about communication in bacteria,
and it's about counting your neighbors,
that we've discovered, that's generic.
And they take that information inside,
of any given population.
that was the pink ovals on my last slide, this is it.
is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme
and makes exactly the same molecule.
This is the bacterial Esperanto.
and that's because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria.
and that selects for resistant mutants.
And so now, of course, we have this global problem
in infectious diseases.
So we thought, what if we could sort of do behavior modifications,
We've also done the same thing with the pink system.
We've taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit
that work against all bacteria.
In this one, I'm just using the interspecies molecule,
it doesn't initiate virulence right away.
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria
and it's going to get us around, at least initially,
this big problem of resistance.
they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon
Bacteria have been on the earth for billions of years;
humans, couple hundred thousand.
we're going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body.
So we know that the principles and the rules,
is that bacteria can distinguish self from other.
but I think about the molecular stuff.
and so we've made these anti-quorum-sensing molecules
that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics.
in you or on you, keeping you healthy.
so bacteria can do things that we want them to do
better than they would be on their own.
What I wanted to talk to you about today is two things:
one, the rise of a culture of availability;
and two, a request.
So we're seeing a rise of this availability
being driven by mobile device proliferation,
globally, across all social strata.
We're seeing, along with that proliferation of mobile devices,
an expectation of availability.
And, with that, comes the third point,
which is obligation -- and an obligation to that availability.
from a societal standpoint,
how we allow people to be available.
There's a significant delta, in fact,
between what we're willing to accept.
Apologies to Hans Rosling --
he said anything that's not using real stats is a lie --
but the big delta there
is how we deal with this from a public standpoint.
So we've developed certain tactics and strategies
to cover up.
And if you've ever been in a meeting where you play sort of meeting "chicken,"
you're sitting there, looking at the person, waiting for them to look away,
and then quickly checking the device.
Although you can see the gentleman up on the right is busting him.
OK, the gentleman on the left is saying, "Screw you,
I'm going to check my device."
But the guy, here, on the right,
he's doing the stretch.
It's that reeeee-e-e-each out, the physical contortion
to get that device just below the tabletop.
(Laughter)
Nothing says "I love you"
like "Let me find somebody else I give a damn about."
You can find this on YouTube,
the gentleman who's recumbent on a motorcycle
while text messaging.
Or what we call the "sweet gravy, stop me before I kill again!"
That is actually the device.
(Laughter)
a direct collision --
we find a direct collision between availability --
and what's possible through availability --
and a fundamental human need -- which we've been hearing about a lot, actually --
the need to create shared narratives.
We're very good at creating personal narratives,
but it's the shared narratives that make us a culture.
And when you're standing with someone,
and you're on your mobile device,
effectively what you're saying to them is,
"You are not as important as, literally,
almost anything that could come to me through this device."
There might be somebody on one right now,
participating in multi-dimensional engagement.
than the story we're going to tell about it later.
This poor kid, clearly a prop --
don't get me wrong, a willing prop --
but the kiss that's being documented kind of looks like it sucks.
it becomes incredibly important
that what you share becomes the context of shared narrative,
becomes the context in which we live.
The stories that we tell -- what we push out --
becomes who we are.
People aren't simply projecting identity,
they're creating it.
We are creating the technology
that is going to create the new shared experience,
which will create the new world.
And so my request is,
please, let's make technologies
that make people more human,
and not less.
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --
those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,
whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,
especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.
the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,
as they were sort of like really told
that they must do everything in Afrikaans --
biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?
And the students wanted to speak to the government,
and police answered with bullets.
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate
all those comrades or students who died.
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,
and I started asking questions,
and that’s when my political education started.
And I joined, later on, the youth organization
under the African National Congress.
So as part of organizing this and whatever,
this commemoration, the police will round us up
as they call us leaders.
And I used to run away from home,
when I know that maybe the police might be coming
around the ninth or 10th of June or so.
And my grandmother one time said,
"No, look, you’re not going to run away.
This is your place, you stay here."
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us
and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.
and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,
and opened the kitchen door.
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.
I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,
while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.
He is here, and you're not going to take him.
I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."
And they left.
(Applause) (Music)

Okay.
Well, I count my iPod, cellphone and computer as technology,
Well, this is what I found.
And, you know what?
The best of all is that if I don't want to practice,
(Whispering) I can hide it.
Some people relate it as the shape of a lady.
unlike modern stuff [that] easily looks dated.
But I think it's very personal and unique that,
although each violin looks pretty similar,
I mean, when I first got my violin and tried to play around on it,
Yuk! Yuk! Yuk!
about the greatest violinist, Jascha Heifetz.
After Mr. Heifetz's concert,
a lady came over and complimented him:
And Mr. Heifetz was a very cool person,
so he picked up his violin and said,
"Funny -- I don't hear anything."
to a wonderful entertainment.
But ... although some of the talks were quite up there for me.
if I could actually get my two dimensions correct in school.
well, actually, I would also like to say this for all children
and to make our future world much better.
(Bass guitar and accordion)
Good morning everybody.
We are They Might Be Giants.
But I guess that's in keeping,
so now we'll just move to the PowerPoint presentation,
ladies and gentlemen.
In the spirit of TED, we're bringing you something
that has not been released.
John, do you want to introduce the song?
This is a song about a creature called a hummingbird moth
which imitates another creature
and can only be explained in song.
Thank you very much.
Probably somewhere around 1,500.
It's hard to know.
We've only done two shows in 2007 so far,
but our first show
was actually the coldest performance we've ever had.
It was 19 degrees in St. Louis about a month ago
and I'm happy to report
that this performance you are seeing today
is the earliest we have ever performed.
So thank you.
We are cultural test pilots, ladies and gentlemen.
How early can a rock performance begin?
Not all the facts are in about performing
at 8.30 in the morning.
I can tell you the 19 degree thing
was fantastic.
All right.
about the history of violinists
but we do know that when we entered
the state of New Jersey
there is an uptick in violence.
This song is called "Asbury Park."
It's based on a real life experience.
Marty Beller on the drums over there.
during our brief time here
so this is the one to play.
This song is called "Fingertips."
as a special TED presentation.
We're taking calls live on stage
here at TED in Monterey.
And I think we have a caller coming in here.
Hello there.
You're live.
Hello. Who's there, please?
Am I on the air?
Hi there.
You're on with They Might Be Giants.
This is Eleanor Roosevelt.
Hello, Eleanor, please ...
I want to talk to ...
Please turn off your radio, Eleanor.
I wanna talk to Randi.
I've got a question for Randi.
What's your question, please?
I want to talk to the Amazing Randi.
Do you have a laminated badge, Eleanor?
I want my million dollars.
Eleanor, I'm sorry,
do you have a laminated badge?
No, I don't have a badge.
Well, I think we're going to stop
that part of the show.
as the future anthem of TED.
It's actually a children's song
but like so many projects for children
it's really just a Trojan horse
for adult work.
This song is called
"The Alphabet ...
Of Nations!"
You've been a wonderful 8:30 audience.
Have a great session.
Thank you all.
It's not a joke yet;
Is this thing off?
elegantly.
I’d like to dedicate this next song to Carmelo,
who was put to sleep a couple of days ago, because he got too old.

and he always let the cat sleep in the dog bed.

Thank you.

Thank you.
And she said, "Oh no! Just dis everybody, except Ralph Nader."
But anyway, this is about the evils of science, so I think it’s perfect.
by the way parents of the youngsters in my English classes
But they weren't satisfied when their own --
it would make the teacher feel that they had failed, or the youngster had failed.
And that's not right.
The good Lord in his infinite wisdom didn't create us all equal
If you won them all, you were considered to be reasonably successful --
we had a number of years at UCLA where we didn't lose a game.
as the accumulation of material possessions
or the attainment of a position of power or prestige, or something of that sort,
worthy accomplishments perhaps,
but in my opinion, not necessarily indicative of success.
So I wanted to come up with something of my own.
well, somewhere, I guess in the hidden recesses of the mind,
Never try to be better than someone else,
Then I ran across this simple verse that said,
but they won't necessarily be the same.
Well, that was my idea that I was going to try to get across to the youngsters.
can teach our youth what they should be;
nor all the books on all the shelves --
Maybe it's because Dad used to read to us at night,
And Dad would read poetry to us. So I always liked it.
And about the same time I ran across this one verse,
I ran across another one.
There sits a statesman, strong, unbiased, wise;
or stem the life-blood's flow.
And there a builder; upward rise the arch of a church he builds,
And all about, a gathering of teachers,
farmers, merchants, laborers --
And I may say, I may not see the church,
I knew him once, but then he was a boy.
it's true, you have so many youngsters,
So that was the idea that I tried to get across
to the youngsters under my supervision.
There was a time when I made them wear jackets and shirts and ties.
I believe in time; very important.
they'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession.
and that's not good, for a young married man to go home in a bad mood.
And another one I had was, not one word of profanity.
One word of profanity, and you are out of here for the day.
If I see it in a game, you're going to come out and sit on the bench.
And the third one was, never criticize a teammate.
I didn't want that. I used to tell them I was paid to do that.
That's my job. I'm paid to do it. Pitifully poor, but I am paid to do it.
Not like the coaches today, for gracious sakes, no.
It's a little different than it was in my day.
working hard and enjoying what you're doing,
coming up to the apex,
according to my definition of success.
And right at the top, faith and patience.
believe that things will work out as they should,
providing we do what we should.
I worked on this for some 14 years,
and I think it helped me become a better teacher.
But it all revolved around that original definition of success.
they're very perceptive about those things,
and they noticed he had only one 'i' in his name.
at various times.
what I tried to do in this pyramid.
He called it "The Road Ahead, or the Road Behind."
the only reason we can't win, is the Fates themselves have missed.
Yet there lives on the ancient claim:
You and I know deeper down, there's always a chance to win the crown.
But when we fail to give our best,
of playing through, not letting up.
It's bearing down that wins the cup.
And so the Fates are seldom wrong, no matter how they twist and wind.
It's you and I who make our fates --
we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind."
I tried to get across, too, that --
my opponents will tell you -- you never heard me mention winning.
Never mention winning.
My idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game,
and you can win when you're outscored.
I used to say that when a game is over,
and you see somebody that didn't know the outcome,
I hope they couldn't tell by your actions
whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you.
if you make an effort to do the best you can regularly,
the results will be about what they should be.
only you will know whether you can do that.
and not the end itself.
But it's the getting there that's the fun.
As a basketball coach at UCLA, I liked our practices to be the journey,
and the game would be the end, the end result.
I liked to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play,
I can never answer that.
As far as the individuals are concerned --
I was asked one time about that,
And I said, "Well, I'd want one that knew why he was at UCLA:
to get an education, he was a good student,
I'd want him to be unselfish,
and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time.
Why not just take someone like Keith Wilkes and let it go at that.
He had the qualifications.
two players that gave me great satisfaction,
freshmen couldn't play varsity when I taught.
I thought, "Oh gracious, if these two players, either one of them" --
But they had outstanding shooting percentages,
because they didn't force it.
And neither one could jump very well,
as any players I ever had.
I was told that when he makes his appearance, I was supposed to shut up.
I'm the weekly tech critic for the New York Times.
I review gadgets and stuff.
And mostly what good dads should be doing this time of year
is nestling with their kids and decorating the Christmas tree.
What I'm mostly doing this year
is going on cable TV and answering the same question:
"What are the tech trends for next year?"
And I'm like, "Didn't we just go through this last year?"
completed marriage of the cell phone and the Internet.
You know, I found that volcano on Google Images,
not realizing how much it makes me look like the cover of Dianetics.
when they started carrying your voice over the Internet rather than over a phone line,
and we've come a long way since that.
But that was interesting in itself. This is companies like Vonage.
Basically you take an ordinary telephone, you plug it into this little box
that they give you and the box plugs into your cable modem.
Now, it works just like a regular phone.
So you can pick up the phone, you hear a dial tone,
but its just a fake-out. It's a WAV file of a dial tone,
just to reassure you that the world hasn't ended.
It could be anything. It could be salsa music
or a comedy routine -- it doesn't matter.
The little box has your phone number.
So that's really cool -- you can take it to London or Siberia,
and your next door neighbor can dial your home number and your phone will ring,
because it's got everything in the box.
They've got every feature known to man in there,
because adding a new feature is just software.
I hate that term -- Voice Over Internet --
land-line home-phone service has gone down 30 percent in the last three years.
I mean, no self-respecting college kid has home phone service anymore.
This is what college kids are more likely to have. It's the most popular
VOIP service in the world: It's Skype.
It's a free program you download for your Mac or PC,
and you make free phone calls anywhere in the world
The downside is that you have to wear a headset like a nerd.
It's not your phone -- it's your computer.
But nonetheless, if you're a college kid and you have no money,
believe me, this is better than trying to use your cell phone.
like me, try out Skype for the first time,
which is usually when their kid goes away for a semester abroad.
They don't want to pay the international fees,
so they're like, "Timmy! Is that you?"
But I -- at least it was when I did it --
is when they start putting it on cell phones.
Imagine if you had an ordinary cell phone,
and any time you were in a wireless hotspot --
free calls anywhere in the world,
never pay the cellular company a nickel.
It'd be really, really cool -- and yet,
even though the technology for this has been available
for five years, incredibly,
the number of standard cell phones
offered by US carriers with free VOIP
is zero!
I can't figure out why!
And it's so interesting that I thought I would tell you about it.
It comes from T-Mobile.
And I am not paid by T-Mobile.
I'm not plugging T-Mobile.
The New York Times has very rigid policies about that.
Ever since that Jayson Blair jerk ruined it for all of us.
is because it was introduced last year
on June 29.
Does anyone remember what else happened on June 29 last year?
It was the iPhone. The iPhone came out that day.
I'm like, can you imagine being the
T-Mobile PR lady? You know?
and we're not talking smartphones --
ordinary phones, including a Blackberry, that have Wi-Fi.
The deal is, any time you're in a Wi-Fi hotspot,
all your calls are free.
And when you're out of the hotspot, you're on the regular cellular network.
You're thinking, "Well, how often am I in a hotspot?"
The answer is, "All the time!"
Because they give you
a regular wireless router that works with the phone,
for your house.
Which is really ingenious, because we all know that
T-Mobile is the most pathetic carrier.
They have coverage like the size of my thumbnail.
(Laughter)
But it's a hundred million dollars to put up one of those towers. Right?
They don't have that kind of money. Instead they give each of us
a seven-dollar-and-95-cent box. They're like a stealth tower installation program.
We're putting it in our homes for them!
But the thing that T-Mobile did that nobody's done before
is, when you're on a call an you move from Wi-Fi into cellular range,
the call is handed off in mid-syllable,
seamlessly. I'll show you the advanced technologies
we use at the New York Times to test this gear.
This is me with a camcorder on a phone
going like this.
into the cellular network on a call with my wife --
look at the upper left. That's the Wi-Fi signal.
It just changed to the cellular tower in mid-call.
I don't know why my wife says I never listen to her. I don't get that.
because of the Internet plus cell phone, are melting.
The cool thing about the T-Mobile phones
is that although switching technologies is very advanced,
the billing technology has not caught up.
So what I mean is that you can start a call
in your house in the Wi-Fi hotspot,
you can get in your car and talk until the battery's dead --
which would be like 10 minutes --
Because they don't, they haven't --
well, no, wait! Not so fast.
It also works the other way.
So if you start a call on your cellular network
and you come home, you keep being billed.
Which is why most people with this service
get into the habit of saying,
"Hey, I just got home. Can I call you right back?"
Now you get it.
It's also true that if you use one of these phones overseas,
it doesn't know what Internet hotspot you're in.
On the Internet nobody knows you're a dog,
right? Nobody knows you're in Pakistan.
You can make free unlimited calls
home to the US with these phones. So, very, very interesting.
Does anyone here have a working cell phone
that's on, with coverage, who can make a call right now without a lot of fussing?
OK. Would you call me please right now? [Phone number given.]
And don't you all call me at three a.m. asking me to fix your printer.
I should know not to do technology demos
in front of an audience. It's just, like, absurd.
This one is going off. And -- oh, I have the ringer off. Tsh! Great.
Anyway, this one is also going off. So they're both ringing at the same time.
Excuse me one second.
Hello?
Oh. Where are you calling from?
No, no just kidding. There he is. Thank you very much for doing that.
I didn't even know it was you -- I was looking at this guy.
Oh great! Yeah. Yeah you can all stop calling now!
All right. Ringer off. Everyone wants in on the action.
oh, for gods sake!
where they give you a new phone number,
and then at that point one phone number rings all your phones at once.
Your home phone, your work phone, your cell phone, your yacht phone
(this is the EG crowd).
I know a lot of you are like,
"Ooh, I don't want to be reached at any hour."
But the beauty is it's all going through the internet,
so you get all of these really cool features --
And I want these people to hear this greeting,
"Hi boss, I'm out making us both some money. Leave a message."
And then your wife calls, and, "Hi honey, leave me a message."
Very, very customizable.
Google bought it, and they've been working on it for a year.
They're supposed to come out with it very shortly in a public method.
I don't know if you realize this. When you call 411 on your cell phone,
they charge you two bucks.
Did you know that? It's an outrage.
I actually got a photograph of the Verizon employee right there.
I'm going to tell you how to avoid that now.
What you're going to use is Google Cellular.
It's totally free -- there's not even ads.
If you know how to send a text message, you can get the same information for free.
I'm about to change your life. So here's me doing it.
You send a text message to the word "Google,"
which turns out to be 46645.
Leave off the last "e" for savings.
You type "pharmacy Chicago," or the zip code.
You hit send, and in five seconds,
they will send you back the two closest drugstores,
complete with name address and phone number.
Here it comes.
And it's already written down -- so, like, if you're driving,
you don't have to do one of these things, "Uh huh, uh huh, uh huh."
You can say "Weather," and the name of the city you're going to travel to.
And then in five seconds, they send you back
the complete weather forecast for that town.
Shortly I'll tell you why I was in Milan.
Here we go. And those are just the beginning.
These are all the different things that you can text to Google and they will --
yeah! You're all trying to write this down.
That's cute. I do have an email address. You can just ask me.
It's absolutely phenomenal. The only downside
is that it requires you to know how to text --
send a text message. Nobody over 40 knows how to do that.
This is called Google Info.
They've just launched this voice-activated version of the same thing.
It's speech recognition like you've never heard before.
So lets say I'm in Monterey,
and I want what?
I want to find what? Bagels. OK.
I got the Chinese line.
Top eight results: Number one,
Bagel Bakery on El Dorado Street.
To select number one, you can press one or say "number one."
Number two: Bagel Bakery, commissary department.
Well anyway -- oh! Here we go!
I'll connect you, or say "details," or "go back."
He's just connecting me directly. It's like having a personal valet.
No, no, no -- just kidding, no no.
So anyway, you never even find out the number.
It's just so amazing.
And it has incredible, incredible accuracy.
This is even more amazing. Put this in your speed dial.
This you can ask by voice any question.
Who won the 1958 World Series?
What's the recipe for a certain cocktail?
It's absolutely amazing -- and they text you back the answer.
I tried this this morning just to make sure it's still alive.
"Which actors have played James Bond?"
They text me back this: "Sean Connery,
George Lazenby, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, Daniel Craig."
Right! And then I was trying to pretend I was like a Valley girl.
I'm like, "What's the word that means you know, like,
when the sun, the moon and the earth are, like, all in a line?"
Just to see how the recognition was.
They texted me back, "It's called a syzygy."
Which I knew, because it's the word that won me the Ohio spelling bee in 1976.
make money doing this?" And the answer is: look at the last line.
They put this teeny-weeny little ad, about 10 characters long.
And a lot of people also want to know, "How does it work?
How can it be so good? It's as though there is a human being
on the other end of the line."
Because there is one!
They have 10,000 people
who are being paid 20 cents per answer.
As you can imagine, it's college kids and old people.
That's who can afford to do that.
But it's a human being on the line. And it's gotten me out of so many
tough positions like, "When's the last flight out of Chicago?"
You know. It's just absolutely amazing.
this is probably my biggest pet peeve in all of technology.
When I call to leave you a message,
I get 15 seconds of instructions
from a third-grade teacher on Ambien!
Page? What is this, 1975?
Nobody has pagers anymore.
"You may begin speaking at the tone.
When you have finished recording,
you may hang up." No!
when I call to retrieve my messages,
first of all: "You have 87 messages.
To listen to your messages ... "
Why else am I calling?
So last year I went to Milan, Italy,
and I got to speak to an audience
of cellular executives from 200 countries around the world.
And I said as a joke -- as a joke, I said,
"I did the math. Verizon has 70 million customers.
If you check your voicemail twice a day,
that's 100 million dollars a year.
I bet you guys are doing this just to run up our airtime, aren't you?"
No chuckle. They're like this --
There are these services that transcribe
your voicemail into text.
And they send it either to your email
or as text messages to your phone.
It is a life-changer.
And by the way, they don't always get the words right,
because it's over the phone and all that.
So they attach the audio file at the bottom of the email
so you can listen to double-check.
The services are called things like Spinvox,
Phonetag -- this is the one I use --
Callwave. A lot of people say, "How are they doing this?
I don't really want people listening in to my calls."
The executives at these companies told me,
"Well we use a proprietary B-to-B, best-of-breed, peer-to-peer soluti -- " you know.
I think basically it's like these guys in India with headsets, you know, listening in.
on the first day I tried one of these services,
I got two voicemail messages. One was from a guy named Michael Stevenson,
which shouldn't be that hard to transcribe, and it was misspelled.
The other was from my video producer at the Times, whose name is Vijaiy Singh,
with the silent 'h'. Nailed that one.
that it's all software -- nobody is listening to your messages.
And they also promise that they're going to transcribe only the gist
of your messages.
This is me testing it out.
Hope you're doing well. I'm fine here. Everything's good.
Hey, I was walking along the street and the sky was blue.
And your daughter broke her leg at soccer practice.
I'm going to have a sandwich for lunch.
She's in room -- emergency room 53W.
OK, talk to you later -- bye.
It's a very good transcription. But a couple minutes after that,
I got the text message version. Now remember,
a text message can only be 160 characters long.
So it had better be the gist of the gist, right?
I'm not kidding you. The message said,
This is my favorite of all time. It's called Popularitydialer.com.
Basically, you're going to go on some
iffy date, or a potentially bad meeting.
So you go and you type in your phone number,
and at the exact minute where you want to be called --
And you're like, "I'm sorry. I've got to take this."
The really beautiful thing is,
you know how when somebody's sitting next to you, sometimes they can sort of
hear a little bit of the caller.
So they give you a choice
of what you want to hear on the other end.
Here's the girlfriend.
This is the -- I love this -- the boss call.
was with the iPhone.
Not my finest moment in New York Times journalism.
It was when in the fall of 2006,
I explained why Apple would never do a cell phone.
because -- I don't know if you realize this, but -- until the iPhone came along,
the carriers -- Verizon, AT&T, Cingular --
held veto power over every aspect
of every design of every phone.
I know the people who worked on the Treo.
They went around to these carriers and said,
I don't think so."
It was not very conducive to innovation.
What I didn't anticipate was that Steve Jobs
went around and said, "Tell you what -- I'll give you a five-year exclusive
if you'll let me design this phone in peace --
and you won't even see it till it's done."
Actually, even so, he was turned down by Verizon and others.
Finally Cingular said OK.
Please don't corner me at the party tonight
and go, "What are you? An Apple fan boy?"
- you know. I'm not.
You can see what I said about it. It's a flawed masterpiece.
It's got bad things and good things. Lets all acknowledge that right now.
was that all those carriers saw
that they sold 10 million of these things in a year.
And they said, "Oh my gosh, maybe we've been doing it wrong.
Maybe we should let phone designers design the phones."
for the first time, experience being online all the time.

I don't understand why we're not there yet.
When I'm an old man, I'm going to tell my grandchildren,
"When I was your age, if I wanted to check my email,
I used to drive around town looking for a coffee shop. I did!"
broadcast -- yay, about 150 feet across."
in every room of every building. We have running water.
What's the problem?
Anyway -- but this teaches people what it's like.
You have to go to YouTube
and type in "iPhone Shuffle."
This guy did a mock video of one
that's one inch square, like the real iPod Shuffle.
It's like, "It only has one button.
Touch it and it dials a number at random."
is it opened up this idea of an app store.
It downloads right to the phone.
And you can use the tilt sensor
to steer this car using this game.
These programs can use all the components
of the iPhone -- the touch screen.
This is the Etch-A-Sketch program -- the theme of EG 2008.
You know how you erase it?
Of course. You shake it.
Right, of course. We shake it to erase, like this.
This is the translator program. They have every language in the world.
You type in what you want, and it gives you the translation.
This is amazing. This is Midomi.
A song is running through your head --
you sing it into the thing:
do do do do do, da da da da da da, da dum ...
OK, you tap, "Done" and it will find out the song and play it for you.
I know. It's insane, right?
you type in a band or a song name.
It will immediately play you that song or that band.
It has a thumbs-up and a thumbs-down.
You say if you like this song or not.
If you like it, it tries another song on you
from a different band, with the same instrumentation, vocals,
theme and tempo.
If you like that one, or don't like it,
you do thumbs-up and thumbs-down. Over time it tailors the songs
so that it completely stops playing bad songs.
It eventually only plays songs you like.
You want to find a place to eat. You shake it.
It proposes a restaurant.
It gives you the price, and the location and ratings.
Video: I'm not going all the way to Flushing.
Anyway, just amazing, amazing things.
Of course, its not just about the iPhone.
But now it's everybody else. So Google has done their own Android operating system
that will soon be on handsets -- phones from 34 companies.
Touch screen -- very, very nice.
Also with its own app store, where you can download programs.
Verizon, the most calcified, corporate,
conservative carrier of all,
said, "You can use any phone you want on our network."
I love the Wired headline:
Pigs Fly, Hell Freezes Over
and Verizon Opens Up Its Network -- No. Really.
a new world of innovation, where the cell phone becomes your laptop,
customized the way you want it.
Every cell phone is unique. There is software that you can add on.
Can I do one more one-minute song? Thank you.
It's only three pounds,
or 12 if you install Microsoft Office.
This is a song I did for the New York Times website as a music video.
Ladies and gentlemen, for seven blissful hours
it was the number one video on YouTube.
(To the tune of "My Way")
I'm sick to death
of this old cell phone.
Bad sound, the signal's weak,
the software stinks.
A made-in-Hell phone.
I've heard there's something new --
a million times more rad than my phone.
I too will join the cult.
I want an iPhone.
Concerns -- I have a few. It's got some flaws;
we may just face it.
No keys, no memory card,
the battery's sealed --
you can't replace it.
But God, this thing is sweet.
A multitouch, iPod, Wi-Fi phone.
You had me from, "Hello."
I want an iPhone.
I want to touch its precious screen.
I want to wipe the smudges clean.
I want my friends to look and drool.
I want to say, "Look -- now I'm cool"
I stood in line and I'll get mine.
I want an iPhone.
For what is a man?
What has he got? If not iPhone,
then he's got squat.
It's all the things a phone should be.
Who cares if it's AT&T?
I took a stand, paid half a grand!
And I got an iPhone!
I’m going around the world giving talks about Darwin,
and usually what I’m talking about
is Darwin’s strange inversion of reasoning.
Now that title, that phrase, comes from a critic, an early critic,
and this is a passage that I just love, and would like to read for you.
so that we may enunciate as the fundamental principle of the whole system,
that, in order to make a perfect and beautiful machine,
it is not requisite to know how to make it.
This proposition will be found on careful examination to express,
in condensed form, the essential purport of the Theory,
and to express in a few words all Mr. Darwin’s meaning;
who, by a strange inversion of reasoning,
seems to think Absolute Ignorance fully qualified
to take the place of Absolute Wisdom in the achievements of creative skill."
A creationist pamphlet has this wonderful page in it:
"Test Two:
Do you know of any building that didn’t have a builder? Yes/No.
Do you know of any painting that didn’t have a painter? Yes/No.
Do you know of any car that didn’t have a maker? Yes/No.
If you answered 'Yes' for any of the above, give details."
You would have thought it stands to reason
that design requires an intelligent designer.
But Darwin shows that it’s just false.
which is equally puzzling at first, but in some ways just as important.
It stands to reason that we love chocolate cake because it is sweet.
Guys go for girls like this because they are sexy.
We adore babies because they’re so cute.
And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny.
Let’s start with sweet. Our sweet tooth is basically an evolved sugar detector,
because sugar is high energy, and it’s just been wired up to the preferer,
to put it very crudely, and that’s why we like sugar.
Honey is sweet because we like it, not "we like it because honey is sweet."
There’s nothing intrinsically sweet about honey.
If you looked at glucose molecules till you were blind,
you wouldn’t see why they tasted sweet.
You have to look in our brains to understand why they’re sweet.
So if you think first there was sweetness,
and then we evolved to like sweetness,
you’ve got it backwards; that’s just wrong. It’s the other way round.
Sweetness was born with the wiring which evolved.
And it’s a good thing that there isn’t, because if there were,
then Mother Nature would have a problem:
How on earth do you get chimps to mate?
Now you might think, ah, there’s a solution: hallucinations.
That would be one way of doing it, but there’s a quicker way.
Just wire the chimps up to love that look,
and apparently they do.
That’s all there is to it.
Over six million years, we and the chimps evolved our different ways.
We became bald-bodied, oddly enough;
for one reason or another, they didn’t.
If we hadn’t, then probably this would be the height of sexiness.
It wasn’t designed for chocolate cake.
Chocolate cake is a supernormal stimulus.
The term is owed to Niko Tinbergen,
who did his famous experiments with gulls,
where he found that that orange spot on the gull’s beak --
if he made a bigger, oranger spot
the gull chicks would peck at it even harder.
It was a hyperstimulus for them, and they loved it.
What we see with, say, chocolate cake
is it’s a supernormal stimulus to tweak our design wiring.
And there are lots of supernormal stimuli; chocolate cake is one.
There's lots of supernormal stimuli for sexiness.
It’s important that we love babies, and that we not be put off by, say, messy diapers.
So babies have to attract our affection and our nurturing, and they do.
And, by the way, a recent study shows that mothers
prefer the smell of the dirty diapers of their own baby.
So nature works on many levels here.
But now, if babies didn’t look the way they do -- if babies looked like this,
that’s what we would find adorable, that’s what we would find --
we would think, oh my goodness, do I ever want to hug that.
This is the strange inversion.
This is the hard one, the one that isn’t obvious. That’s why I leave it to the end.
And I won’t be able to say too much about it.
But you have to think evolutionarily, you have to think, what hard job that has to be done --
it’s dirty work, somebody’s got to do it --
is so important to give us such a powerful, inbuilt reward for it when we succeed.
Now, I think we've found the answer -- I and a few of my colleagues.
It’s a neural system that’s wired up to reward the brain
for doing a grubby clerical job.
Our bumper sticker for this view is
that this is the joy of debugging.
Now I’m not going to have time to spell it all out,
but I’ll just say that only some kinds of debugging get the reward.
And what we’re doing is we’re using humor as a sort of neuroscientific probe
by switching humor on and off, by turning the knob on a joke --
now it’s not funny ... oh, now it’s funnier ...
now we’ll turn a little bit more ... now it’s not funny --
in this way, we can actually learn something
about the architecture of the brain,
the functional architecture of the brain.
He’s a computer scientist, Reginald Adams a psychologist, and there I am,
and we’re putting this together into a book.
Thank you very much.
Like the speaker before me -- I am a TED virgin, I guess.
I'm really grateful that I get a chance to play for everyone.
And the song that I just played was by Josef Hofmann.
It's called "Kaleidoscope."
And Hofmann is a Polish pianist and composer of the late 19th century,
and he's widely considered one of the greatest pianists of all time.
It's called "Abegg Variations," by Robert Schumann,
a German 19th-century composer.
The name "Abegg" is actually A-B-E-G-G,
and that's the main theme in the melody.
(Plays the notes A, B, E, G and G)
That comes from the last name of one of Schumann's female friends.
there are supposed to be five variations on this Abegg theme.
It's written around 1834,
so even though it's old, I hope you'll like it.
Well, because Mr. Anderson told me
that this session is called "Sync and Flow,"
I was wondering, "What do I know that these geniuses don't?"
even though I don't know where to start.
I think Yamaha does a really good job of teaching us how to compose.
What I do first is, I make a lot of little musical ideas
you can just improvise here at the piano --
and I choose one of those to become my main theme, my main melody,
like the Abegg that you just heard.
And once I choose my main theme, I have to decide:
Out of all the styles in music, what kind of style do I want?
And this year, I composed a Romantic style.
So for inspiration, I listened to Liszt and Tchaikovsky
and all the great Romantic composers.
They help me plan out the whole piece.
And then the hard part is filling it in with musical ideas,
because then you have to think.
solidified, excuse me -- solidified form,
you're supposed to actually polish the piece, polish the details,
and then polish the overall performance of the composition.
Drawing, because I like to draw, you know, Japanese anime art.
I think that's a craze among teens right now.
And once I realized it,
there's a parallel between creating music and creating art,
because for your motive, or your little initial idea for your drawing,
it's your character -- you want to decide who you want to draw,
or if you want to draw an original character.
And then you want to decide: How are you going to draw the character?
Like, am I going to use one page? Am I going to draw it on the computer?
Am I going to use a two-page spread like a comic book?
For a more grandiose effect, I guess.
And then you have to do the initial sketch of the character,
which is like your structure of a piece,
and then you add pen and pencil, and whatever details that you need --
that's polishing the drawing.
because I know I'm one of those teenagers that are really easily distracted.
So if I'm trying to do homework and I don't feel like it,
I'll try to draw or, you know, waste my time.
And then what happens is, sometimes I absolutely can't draw
or I can't compose at all,
and then it's like there's too much on your mind.
You can't focus on what you're supposed to do.
And sometimes, if you manage to use your time wisely and work on it,
you'll get something out of it, but it doesn't come naturally.
if something natural happens to you,
you're able to produce all this beautiful stuff instantly,
and then that's what I consider "flow,"
because that's when everything clicks and you're able to do anything.
although I did finish it, it's way too long.
Instead, I'd like to try something called "improvisation."
I have here seven note cards,
one with each note of the musical alphabet.
And I'd like someone to come up here and choose five --
anyone to come up here and choose five --
and then I can make it into some sort of melody,
and I'll improvise it.
I'm going to try to put that in some sort of order.
So, I'm going to have a moment to think,
and I'll try to make something out of it.
is called "Bumble Boogie," by Jack Fina.
I’m working a lot with motion and animation,
and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,
but they always seem to be so reactive.
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators
and try to make the music be the voice
and have the animation following it?
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --
many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,
and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --
and we did this little animation.
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,
that it deals with two problematic issues,
which are rising waters and religion.
he warned Noah to build an Ark.
And after Noah built his Ark,
I believe he told Noah to warn the people
that they must change all their wicked ways
before he come upon them and destroy them.
And when Noah had done built his Ark,
I understand that somebody began to rend a song.
And the song began to move on I understand like this.
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.
and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in
is trying to find a way of
making the computer into a personal mode of expression.
And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,
and in a way those are my bane:
I think there's a great homogenizing force
that software imposes on people and limits the way they think
about what's possible on the computer.
Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,
you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more
than what most people think, and my art has just been about
trying to find a personal way of using the computer,
and so I end up writing software to do that.
and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --
to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment
to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.
I did a performance with two singers
who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;
we repeated it in England.
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them
with a large screen.
We used a computer vision tracking system
in order to know where they were.
And since we know where their heads are,
and we have a wireless mic on them
that we're processing the sound from,
we're able to create visualizations
which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.
This will take about 30 seconds or so.
He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.
I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,
you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,
and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.
And with that, I think I should give up the stage,
so, thank you so much.
I want to talk to you today a little bit
about predictable irrationality.
And my interest in irrational behavior
started many years ago in the hospital.
I was burned very badly.
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital,
you'll see a lot of types of irrationalities.
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department
was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me.
Now, you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point,
and you must have wondered what's the right approach.
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity --
or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly --
you take a long time, but each second is not as painful --
which one of those is the right approach?
was the ripping one, so they would grab hold and they would rip,
and they would grab hold and they would rip.
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned, it would take about an hour.
And as you can imagine,
I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity.
And I would try to reason with them and say,
"Why don't we try something else?
Why don't we take it a little longer --
maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity?"
And the nurses told me two things.
They told me that they had the right model of the patient --
that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain --
and they also told me that the word patient doesn't mean
to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
This is not just in Hebrew, by the way.
It's in every language I've had experience with so far.
and they kept on doing what they were doing.
And about three years later, when I left the hospital,
I started studying at the university.
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned
was that there is an experimental method
that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question
in some abstract way, and you can try to examine this question,
maybe learn something about the world.
I was still interested
in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients.
So originally I didn't have much money,
so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter's vice.
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it,
and I would crunch it a little bit.
and pain that went up and pain that went down,
and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain.
And when I finished hurting people a little bit, I would ask them,
so, how painful was this? Or, how painful was this?
Or, if you had to choose between the last two,
which one would you choose?
I moved to sounds, electrical shocks --
I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain.
what I learned was that the nurses were wrong.
Here were wonderful people with good intentions
and plenty of experience, and nevertheless
they were getting things wrong predictably all the time.
It turns out that because we don't encode duration
in the way that we encode intensity,
I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer
and the intensity was lower.
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face,
which was much more painful, and move toward my legs,
giving me a trend of improvement over time --
that would have been also less painful.
And it also turns out that it would have been good
to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain.
All of these would have been great things to do,
and my nurses had no idea.
are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong
in this particular decision, or is it a more general case?
And it turns out it's a more general case --
there's a lot of mistakes we do.
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities,
and I want to talk to you about cheating.
And the reason I picked cheating is because it's interesting,
but also it tells us something, I think,
about the stock market situation we're in.
So, my interest in cheating started
when Enron came on the scene, exploded all of a sudden,
and I started thinking about what is happening here.
Is it the case that there was kind of
a few apples who are capable of doing these things,
or are we talking a more endemic situation,
that many people are actually capable of behaving this way?
And here's how it went.
If you were in the experiment, I would pass you a sheet of paper
with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve,
but I wouldn't give you enough time.
When the five minutes were over, I would say,
"Pass me the sheets of paper, and I'll pay you a dollar per question."
People did this. I would pay people four dollars for their task --
on average people would solve four problems.
Other people I would tempt to cheat.
I would pass their sheet of paper.
When the five minutes were over, I would say,
"Please shred the piece of paper.
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack,
and tell me how many questions you got correctly."
People now solved seven questions on average.
Now, it wasn't as if there was a few bad apples --
a few people cheated a lot.
Instead, what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit.
cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis.
You say, what's the probability of being caught?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught?
And you weigh these options out --
you do the simple cost-benefit analysis,
and you decide whether it's worthwhile to commit the crime or not.
So, we try to test this.
For some people, we varied how much money they could get away with --
how much money they could steal.
We paid them 10 cents per correct question, 50 cents,
a dollar, five dollars, 10 dollars per correct question.
people would cheat more, but in fact it wasn't the case.
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit.
What about the probability of being caught?
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper,
so there was some evidence left.
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper.
Some people shredded everything, went out of the room,
and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars.
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down,
people would cheat more, but again, this was not the case.
Again, a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit,
and they were insensitive to these economic incentives.
to the economic rational theory explanations, to these forces,
what could be going on?"
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces.
At one hand, we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror
and feel good about ourselves, so we don't want to cheat.
On the other hand, we can cheat a little bit,
and still feel good about ourselves.
So, maybe what is happening is that
there's a level of cheating we can't go over,
but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree,
as long as it doesn't change our impressions about ourselves.
We call this like a personal fudge factor.
Initially we said, what can we do to shrink the fudge factor?
So, we got people to the lab, and we said,
"We have two tasks for you today."
First, we asked half the people
to recall either 10 books they read in high school,
or to recall The Ten Commandments,
and then we tempted them with cheating.
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments --
and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments --
but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments,
given the opportunity to cheat, did not cheat at all.
It wasn't that the more religious people --
the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less,
and the less religious people --
the people who couldn't remember almost any Commandments --
cheated more.
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments,
they stopped cheating.
In fact, even when we gave self-declared atheists
the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat,
they don't cheat at all.
Now, Ten Commandments is something that is hard
to bring into the education system, so we said,
"Why don't we get people to sign the honor code?"
So, we got people to sign,
"I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code."
Then they shredded it. No cheating whatsoever.
And this is particularly interesting,
because MIT doesn't have an honor code.
(Laughter)
What about increasing the fudge factor?
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT
and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators --
these were common refrigerators for the undergrads.
And I came back to measure what we technically call
the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators?
As you can expect it doesn't last very long; people take it.
In contrast, I took a plate with six one-dollar bills,
and I left those plates in the same refrigerators.
No bill ever disappeared.
so to do it better I did the same experiment
as I described to you before.
A third of the people we passed the sheet, they gave it back to us.
A third of the people we passed it to, they shredded it,
they came to us and said,
"Mr. Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X dollars."
A third of the people, when they finished shredding the piece of paper,
they came to us and said,
"Mr Experimenter, I solved X problems. Give me X tokens."
We did not pay them with dollars; we paid them with something else.
And then they took the something else, they walked 12 feet to the side,
and exchanged it for dollars.
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home,
compared to how bad would you feel
about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box?
These things feel very differently.
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds
by being paid by token make a difference?
Our subjects doubled their cheating.
I'll tell you what I think
about this and the stock market in a minute.
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet,
because in Enron, there's also a social element.
People see each other behaving.
In fact, every day when we open the news
we see examples of people cheating.
What does this cause us?
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment,
and we prepaid them.
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment,
and we told them that at the end, we asked them
to pay us back the money they didn't make. OK?
The same thing happens.
When we give people the opportunity to cheat, they cheat.
They cheat just by a little bit, all the same.
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student.
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds, and said,
"I solved everything. What do I do now?"
And the experimenter said, "If you've finished everything, go home.
That's it. The task is finished."
So, now we had a student -- an acting student --
that was a part of the group.
Nobody knew it was an actor.
And they clearly cheated in a very, very serious way.
What would happen to the other people in the group?
Will they cheat more, or will they cheat less?
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they're wearing.
Here is the thing.
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh.
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities,
Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh.
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment
were Carnegie Mellon students.
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student --
he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student --
but he was a part of their group, cheating went up.
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt,
cheating went down.
when the moment the student stood up,
it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating,
because the experimenter said,
"You've finished everything. Go home," and they went with the money.
So it wasn't so much about the probability of being caught again.
It was about the norms for cheating.
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating,
we feel it's more appropriate, as a group, to behave this way.
But if it's somebody from another group, these terrible people --
I mean, not terrible in this --
but somebody we don't want to associate ourselves with,
from another university, another group,
all of a sudden people's awareness of honesty goes up --
a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment --
and people cheat even less.
We've learned that a lot of people can cheat.
They cheat just by a little bit.
When we remind people about their morality, they cheat less.
When we get bigger distance from cheating,
from the object of money, for example, people cheat more.
And when we see cheating around us,
particularly if it's a part of our in-group, cheating goes up.
Now, if we think about this in terms of the stock market,
think about what happens.
What happens in a situation when you create something
where you pay people a lot of money
to see reality in a slightly distorted way?
Would they not be able to see it this way?
Of course they would.
What happens when you do other things,
like you remove things from money?
You call them stock, or stock options, derivatives,
mortgage-backed securities.
Could it be that with those more distant things,
it's not a token for one second,
it's something that is many steps removed from money
for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more?
And what happens to the social environment
when people see other people behave around them?
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way
in the stock market.
about behavioral economics.
We have many intuitions in our life,
and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong.
The question is, are we going to test those intuitions?
We can think about how we're going to test this intuition
in our private life, in our business life,
and most particularly when it goes to policy,
when we think about things like No Child Left Behind,
when you create new stock markets, when you create other policies --
taxation, health care and so on.
And the difficulty of testing our intuition
was the big lesson I learned
when I went back to the nurses to talk to them.
and tell them what I found out about removing bandages.
And I learned two interesting things.
One was that my favorite nurse, Ettie,
told me that I did not take her pain into consideration.
She said, "Of course, you know, it was very painful for you.
But think about me as a nurse,
taking, removing the bandages of somebody I liked,
and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time.
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me, too."
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her.
But it was actually more interesting than that, because she said,
"I did not think that your intuition was right.
I felt my intuition was correct."
So, if you think about all of your intuitions,
it's very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong.
And she said, "Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ..." --
she thought her intuition was right --
it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment
to try and check whether she was wrong.
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things --
our own ability, how the economy works,
how we should pay school teachers.
But unless we start testing those intuitions,
we're not going to do better.
And just think about how better my life would have been
if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition,
and how everything would have been better
if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions.
and I titled it "Serious Nonsense."
So I think I'm actually the first one here -- I lead.
I called it "Serious Nonsense" because on the serious side,
I use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration
which you can't see there.
This was one of a series called "Zany Afternoons," which became a book.
And the peak time for that was the 30s,
because the Depression was so dismal
that anything to get away from the present into the future ...
and technology was going to carry us along.
I had a huge collection of them from the '30s --
all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses
playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour --
dining on the wing of a plane. You can't see it very well here,
but that's Hemingway reading some pages from his new novel
I think it adds a huge amount.
Those, for example, are Mark IV British tanks from 1916.
They had two machine guns and a cannon,
for an issue of the Lampoon, and I did that,
I try to make life in New York look even weirder than it is with those covers.
"This is too serious and solemn to make fun of. You should be ashamed,
please apologize on our website."
Haven't got around to it yet but -- I may.
This is the audition for "King Kong."
Truth about that one is I had a horrible red wine hangover,
and I don't think it will ever be done again --
successive pages in the front of the magazine.
It's the ascent of man using an escalator, and it's in three parts.
You can't see it all together, unfortunately, but if you look at it enough,
you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move.
I have a kids' book coming out in the fall called "Marvel Sandwiches,"
a compendium of all the serious play that ever was,
I've been working on issues of poverty for more than 20 years,
and so it's ironic that the problem that and question that I most grapple with
is how you actually define poverty. What does it mean?
So often, we look at dollar terms --
people making less than a dollar or two or three a day.
And yet the complexity of poverty really has to look at
income as only one variable.
Because really, it's a condition about choice,
and the lack of freedom.
the understanding that I have.
It was in Kenya, and I want to share it with you.
I was with my friend Susan Meiselas, the photographer,
in the Mathare Valley slums.
Now, Mathare Valley is one of the oldest slums in Africa.
It's about three miles out of Nairobi,
and it's a mile long and about two-tenths of a mile wide,
where over half a million people
live crammed in these little tin shacks,
generation after generation, renting them,
often eight or 10 people to a room.
And it's known for prostitution, violence, drugs:
a hard place to grow up.
And when we were walking through the narrow alleys,
it was literally impossible not to step in the
raw sewage and the garbage alongside the little homes.
But at the same time it was also
impossible not to see the human vitality,
the aspiration and the ambition of the people who live there:
women washing their babies, washing their clothes, hanging them out to dry.
I met this woman, Mama Rose,
who has rented that little tin shack for 32 years,
where she lives with her seven children.
Four sleep in one twin bed,
and three sleep on the mud and linoleum floor.
And she keeps them all in school by selling water from that kiosk,
and from selling soap and bread from the little store inside.
and I was reminded how Mathare is still connected to the globe.
And I would see kids on the street corners,
and they'd say "Obama, he's our brother!"
And I'd say "Well, Obama's my brother, so that makes you my brother too."
And they would look quizzically, and then be like, "High five!"
I was struck immediately by the kindness and the gentleness in her face,
and I asked her to tell me her story.
She started off by telling me her dream. She said, "I had two.
My first dream was to be a doctor,
and the second was to marry a good man
who would stay with me and my family,
because my mother was a single mom,
and couldn't afford to pay for school fees.
So I had to give up the first dream, and I focused on the second."
She got married when she was 18, had a baby right away.
And when she turned 20, found herself pregnant with a second child,
her mom died and her husband left her -- married another woman.
So she was again in Mathare, with no income, no skill set, no money.
And so she ultimately turned to prostitution.
It wasn't organized in the way we often think of it.
She would go into the city at night with about 20 girls,
look for work, and sometimes come back with a few shillings,
or sometimes with nothing.
And she said, "You know, the poverty wasn't so bad. It was the humiliation
and the embarrassment of it all."
She had a girlfriend who had heard about this organization, Jamii Bora,
that would lend money to people no matter how poor you were,
as long as you provided a commensurate amount in savings.
And so she spent a year to save 50 dollars,
and started borrowing, and over time she was able to buy a sewing machine.
She started tailoring.
And that turned into what she does now,
which is to go into the secondhand clothing markets,
and for about three dollars and 25 cents she buys an old ball gown.
Some of them might be ones you gave.
And she repurposes them with frills and ribbons,
and makes these frothy confections that she sells to women
for their daughter's Sweet 16 or first Holy Communion --
those milestones in a life that people want to celebrate
all along the economic spectrum.
And she does really good business. In fact, I watched her
walk through the streets hawking. And before you knew it,
there was a crowd of women around her, buying these dresses.
and also the jewelry that she makes,
that now Jane makes more than four dollars a day.
And by many definitions she is no longer poor.
But she still lives in Mathare Valley.
And so she can't move out.
She lives with all of that insecurity,
and in fact, in January, during the ethnic riots,
she was chased from her home and had to find a new shack
in which she would live.
that when we're talking about poverty,
we've got to look at people all along the economic spectrum.
And so with patient capital from Acumen and other organizations,
loans and investments that will go the long term with them,
they built a low-cost housing development,
about an hour outside Nairobi central.
And they designed it from the perspective of
customers like Jane herself,
insisting on responsibility and accountability.
So she has to give 10 percent of the mortgage --
of the total value, or about 400 dollars in savings.
And then they match her mortgage to what she paid in rent for her little shanty.
And in the next couple of weeks, she's going to be
among the first 200 families to move into this development.
or whether she would miss anything from Mathare,
she said, "What would I fear
that I haven't confronted already?
I'm HIV positive. I've dealt with it all."
And she said, "What would I miss?
You think I will miss the violence or the drugs? The lack of privacy?
Do you think I'll miss not knowing if my children are going to come home
at the end of the day?" She said "If you gave me 10 minutes
my bags would be packed."
I said, "Well what about your dreams?"
And she said, "Well, you know,
my dreams don't look exactly like I thought they would when I was a little girl.
But if I think about it, I thought I wanted a husband,
but what I really wanted was a family
that was loving. And I fiercely love my children, and they love me back."
She said, "I thought that I wanted to be a doctor,
but what I really wanted to be was somebody
who served and healed and cured.
And so I feel so blessed with everything that I have,
that two days a week I go and I counsel HIV patients.
And I say, 'Look at me. You are not dead.
You are still alive. And if you are still alive you have to serve.'"
And she said, "I'm not a doctor who gives out pills.
But maybe me, I give out something better
because I give them hope."
where so many of us are inclined to pull in
with fear, I think we're well suited to
take a cue from Jane and reach out,
recognizing that being poor doesn't mean being ordinary.
Because when systems are broken,
like the ones that we're seeing around the world,
it's an opportunity for invention and for innovation.
It's an opportunity to truly build a world
where we can extend services and products
to all human beings, so that they can
make decisions and choices for themselves.
I truly believe it's where dignity starts.
We owe it to the Janes of the world.
And just as important, we owe it to ourselves.
If you're at all like me,
this is what you do with the sunny summer weekends in San Francisco:
you build experimental kite-powered hydrofoils
capable of more than 30 knots.
And you realize that there is incredible power in the wind,
and it can do amazing things.
And one day, a vessel not unlike this
will probably break the world speed record.
Kites: I'm going to give you a brief history,
and tell you about the magnificent future
of every child's favorite plaything.
So, kites are more than a thousand years old,
and the Chinese used them for military applications,
and even for lifting men.
So they knew at that stage they could carry large weights.
I'm not sure why there is a hole in this particular man.
actually pioneered the use of kites for towing buggies
in races against horse carriages across the English countryside.
Then of course, at the dawn of aviation,
all of the great inventors of the time --
like Hargreaves, like Langley,
even Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, who was flying this kite --
were doing so in the pursuit of aviation.
and they were flying kites to develop the control systems
that would ultimately enable powered human flight.
So this is of course Orville and Wilbur Wright,
and the Wright Flyer.
And their experiments with kites led to this
momentous occasion, where we powered up and took off for the
first-ever 12-second human flight.
And that was fantastic for the future of commercial aviation.
That was until the 1970s, where we had the last energy crisis.
And a fabulous man called Miles Loyd
who lives on the outskirts of San Francisco,
wrote this seminal paper that was completely ignored
in the Journal of Energy
about how to use basically an airplane on a piece of string
to generate enormous amounts of electricity.
The real key observation he made is that
a free-flying wing can sweep through more sky and generate more power
in a unit of time than a fixed-wing turbine.
but they can't really go a lot higher,
and more height is where the more wind is, and more power --
as much as twice as much.
and now we have a climate crisis as well. You know,
so humans generate about 12 trillion watts,
or 12 terawatts, from fossil fuels.
And Al Gore has spoken to why we need to hit one of these targets,
and in reality what that means is in the next 30 to 40 years,
we have to make 10 trillion watts or more of new clean energy somehow.
Wind is the second-largest renewable resource after solar:
3600 terawatts, more than enough to supply humanity 200 times over.
The majority of it is in the higher altitudes, above 300 feet,
where we don't have a technology as yet to get there.
This is our test site on Maui, flying across the sky.
I'm now going to show you
the first autonomous generation of power
by every child's favorite plaything.
As you can tell, you need to be a robot to fly this thing for thousands of hours.
It makes you a little nauseous.
And here we're actually generating about 10 kilowatts --
so, enough to power probably five United States households --
with a kite not much larger than this piano.
And the real significant thing here
is we're developing the control systems,
as did the Wright brothers, that would enable sustained, long-duration flight.
And it doesn't hurt to do it in a location like this either.
that's tracing your name in the sky.
So we're beyond the 12-second steps.
And we're working towards megawatt-scale machines
that fly at 2000 feet and generate tons of clean electricity.
Well, this paper plane would be maybe a -- oop!
That would be enough to power your cell phone.
Your Cessna would be 230 killowatts.
If you'd loan me your Gulfstream, I'll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt.
If you give me a 747, I'll make six megawatts,
which is more than the largest wind turbines today.
And the Spruce Goose would be a 15-megawatt wing.
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history.
This is a refrigerator factory,
churning out airplanes for World War II.
Prior to World War II, they were making 1000 planes a year.
By 1945, they were making 100,000.
With this factory and 100,000 planes a year,
we could make all of America's electricity in about 10 years.
with these dreams. There are many of us.
I am lucky enough to work with 30 of them.
And I think we need to support all of the dreams
of the kids out there doing these crazy things.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Time flies.
It's actually almost 20 years ago
when I wanted to reframe the way we use information,
the way we work together: I invented the World Wide Web.
Now, 20 years on, at TED,
I want to ask your help in a new reframing.
I wrote a memo suggesting the global hypertext system.
Nobody really did anything with it, pretty much.
But 18 months later -- this is how innovation happens --
18 months later, my boss said I could do it on the side,
as a sort of a play project,
kick the tires of a new computer we'd got.
And so he gave me the time to code it up.
So I basically roughed out what HTML should look like:
hypertext protocol, HTTP;
the idea of URLs, these names for things
which started with HTTP.
I wrote the code and put it out there.
Well, it was basically frustration.
I was frustrated -- I was working as a software engineer
in this huge, very exciting lab,
lots of people coming from all over the world.
They brought all sorts of different computers with them.
They had all sorts of different data formats,
all sorts, all kinds of documentation systems.
So that, in all that diversity,
if I wanted to figure out how to build something
out of a bit of this and a bit of this,
everything I looked into, I had to connect to some new machine,
I had to learn to run some new program,
I would find the information I wanted in some new data format.
And these were all incompatible.
It was just very frustrating.
The frustration was all this unlocked potential.
So if you just imagined them all
being part of some big, virtual documentation system in the sky,
say on the Internet,
then life would be so much easier.
Well, once you've had an idea like that it kind of gets under your skin
and even if people don't read your memo --
actually he did, it was found after he died, his copy.
He had written, "Vague, but exciting," in pencil, in the corner.
what the web was like.
It's difficult to explain to people now that it was difficult then.
But then -- OK, when TED started, there was no web
so things like "click" didn't have the same meaning.
I can show somebody a piece of hypertext,
a page which has got links,
and we click on the link and bing -- there'll be another hypertext page.
Not impressive.
You know, we've seen that -- we've got things on hypertext on CD-ROMs.
What was difficult was to get them to imagine:
to virtually any document you could imagine.
Alright, that is the leap that was very difficult for people to make.
Well, some people did.
So yeah, it was difficult to explain, but there was a grassroots movement.
And that is what has made it most fun.
That has been the most exciting thing,
not the technology, not the things people have done with it,
but actually the community, the spirit of all these people
getting together, sending the emails.
That's what it was like then.
I asked everybody, more or less, to put their documents --
I said, "Could you put your documents on this web thing?"
And you did.
Thanks.
It's been a blast, hasn't it?
I mean, it has been quite interesting
because we've found out that the things that happen with the web
really sort of blow us away.
They're much more than we'd originally imagined
when we put together the little, initial website
that we started off with.
Now, I want you to put your data on the web.
Turns out that there is still huge unlocked potential.
There is still a huge frustration
that people have because we haven't got data on the web as data.
Well, documents you read, OK?
More or less, you read them, you can follow links from them, and that's it.
Data -- you can do all kinds of stuff with a computer.
Who was here or has otherwise seen Hans Rosling's talk?
One of the great -- yes a lot of people have seen it --
one of the great TED Talks.
Hans put up this presentation
in which he showed, for various different countries, in various different colors --
he showed income levels on one axis
and he showed infant mortality, and he shot this thing animated through time.
So, he'd taken this data and made a presentation
which just shattered a lot of myths that people had
about the economics in the developing world.
It had underground all the data
OK, data is brown and boxy and boring,
and that's how we think of it, isn't it?
Because data you can't naturally use by itself
But in fact, data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives
and it happens because somebody takes that data and does something with it.
In this case, Hans had put the data together
he had found from all kinds of United Nations websites and things.
He had put it together,
combined it into something more interesting than the original pieces
and then he'd put it into this software,
which I think his son developed, originally,
and produces this wonderful presentation.
And Hans made a point
of saying, "Look, it's really important to have a lot of data."
And I was happy to see that at the party last night
that he was still saying, very forcibly, "It's really important to have a lot of data."
not just two pieces of data being connected, or six like he did,
but I want to think about a world where everybody has put data on the web
and so virtually everything you can imagine is on the web
and then calling that linked data.
The technology is linked data, and it's extremely simple.
If you want to put something on the web there are three rules:
first thing is that those HTTP names --
those things that start with "http:" --
we're using them not just for documents now,
we're using them for things that the documents are about.
We're using them for people, we're using them for places,
we're using them for your products, we're using them for events.
All kinds of conceptual things, they have names now that start with HTTP.
and I do the web thing with it and I fetch the data
using the HTTP protocol from the web,
I will get back some data in a standard format
which is kind of useful data that somebody might like to know
about that thing, about that event.
Who's at the event? Whatever it is about that person,
where they were born, things like that.
So the second rule is I get important information back.
it's not just got somebody's height and weight and when they were born,
it's got relationships.
Data is relationships.
Interestingly, data is relationships.
This person was born in Berlin; Berlin is in Germany.
And when it has relationships, whenever it expresses a relationship
then the other thing that it's related to
is given one of those names that starts HTTP.
So, I can go ahead and look that thing up.
So I look up a person -- I can look up then the city where they were born; then
I can look up the region it's in, and the town it's in,
and the population of it, and so on.
So I can browse this stuff.
That is linked data.
I wrote an article entitled "Linked Data" a couple of years ago
and soon after that, things started to happen.
The idea of linked data is that we get lots and lots and lots
of these boxes that Hans had,
and we get lots and lots and lots of things sprouting.
It's not just a whole lot of other plants.
It's not just a root supplying a plant,
but for each of those plants, whatever it is --
a presentation, an analysis, somebody's looking for patterns in the data --
they get to look at all the data
and they get it connected together,
and the really important thing about data
is the more things you have to connect together, the more powerful it is.
The meme went out there.
And, pretty soon Chris Bizer at the Freie Universitat in Berlin
who was one of the first people to put interesting things up,
he noticed that Wikipedia --
you know Wikipedia, the online encyclopedia
with lots and lots of interesting documents in it.
And in most information boxes, there's data.
So he wrote a program to take the data, extract it from Wikipedia,
and put it into a blob of linked data
on the web, which he called dbpedia.
Dbpedia is represented by the blue blob in the middle of this slide
and if you actually go and look up Berlin,
you'll find that there are other blobs of data
which also have stuff about Berlin, and they're linked together.
So if you pull the data from dbpedia about Berlin,
you'll end up pulling up these other things as well.
And the exciting thing is it's starting to grow.
This is just the grassroots stuff again, OK?
Data comes in fact in lots and lots of different forms.
Think of the diversity of the web. It's a really important thing
that the web allows you to put all kinds of data up there.
So it is with data. I could talk about all kinds of data.
We could talk about government data, enterprise data is really important,
there's scientific data, there's personal data,
there's weather data, there's data about events,
there's data about talks, and there's news and there's all kinds of stuff.
I'm just going to mention a few of them
so that you get the idea of the diversity of it,
so that you also see how much unlocked potential.
Barack Obama said in a speech,
that he -- American government data would be available on the Internet
in accessible formats.
And I hope that they will put it up as linked data.
That's important. Why is it important?
Not just for transparency, yeah transparency in government is important,
but that data -- this is the data from all the government departments
Think about how much of that data is about how life is lived in America.
It's actual useful. It's got value.
I can use it in my company.
I could use it as a kid to do my homework.
So we're talking about making the place, making the world run better
by making this data available.
in a government department, often you find that
these people, they're very tempted to keep it --
Hans calls it database hugging.
You hug your database, you don't want to let it go
until you've made a beautiful website for it.
Well, I'd like to suggest that rather --
yes, make a beautiful website,
who am I to say don't make a beautiful website?
Make a beautiful website, but first
give us the unadulterated data,
we want the data.
We want unadulterated data.
OK, we have to ask for raw data now.
And I'm going to ask you to practice that, OK?
Can you say "raw"?
people come up with to hang onto their data
and not give it to you, even though you've paid for it as a taxpayer.
And it's not just America. It's all over the world.
And it's not just governments, of course -- it's enterprises as well.
Here we are at TED, and all the time we are very conscious
of the huge challenges that human society has right now --
curing cancer, understanding the brain for Alzheimer's,
understanding the economy to make it a little bit more stable,
understanding how the world works.
The people who are going to solve those -- the scientists --
they have half-formed ideas in their head,
they try to communicate those over the web.
But a lot of the state of knowledge of the human race at the moment
is on databases, often sitting in their computers,
and actually, currently not shared.
if you're looking at Alzheimer's, for example,
drug discovery -- there is a whole lot of linked data which is just coming out
because scientists in that field realize
this is a great way of getting out of those silos,
because they had their genomics data in one database
in one building, and they had their protein data in another.
Now, they are sticking it onto -- linked data --
and now they can ask the sort of question, that you probably wouldn't ask,
I wouldn't ask -- they would.
What proteins are involved in signal transduction
and also related to pyramidal neurons?
Well, you take that mouthful and you put it into Google.
Of course, there's no page on the web which has answered that question
because nobody has asked that question before.
You get 223,000 hits --
no results you can use.
You ask the linked data -- which they've now put together --
32 hits, each of which is a protein which has those properties
and you can look at.
The power of being able to ask those questions, as a scientist --
questions which actually bridge across different disciplines --
is really a complete sea change.
It's very very important.
Scientists are totally stymied at the moment --
the power of the data that other scientists have collected is locked up
and we need to get it unlocked so we can tackle those huge problems.
and has nothing to do with you.
But, that's not true.
In fact, data is about our lives.
You just -- you log on to your social networking site,
your favorite one, you say, "This is my friend."
Bing! Relationship. Data.
You say, "This photograph, it's about -- it depicts this person. "
Bing! That's data. Data, data, data.
Every time you do things on the social networking site,
the social networking site is taking data and using it -- re-purposing it --
and using it to make other people's lives more interesting on the site.
But, when you go to another linked data site --
and let's say this is one about travel,
and you say, "I want to send this photo to all the people in that group,"
you can't get over the walls.
The Economist wrote an article about it, and lots of people have blogged about it --
tremendous frustration.
The way to break down the silos is to get inter-operability
between social networking sites.
We need to do that with linked data.
Before I came down here, I looked it up on OpenStreetMap
The OpenStreetMap's a map, but it's also a Wiki.
Zoom in and that square thing is a theater -- which we're in right now --
The Terrace Theater. It didn't have a name on it.
So I could go into edit mode, I could select the theater,
I could add down at the bottom the name, and I could save it back.
And now if you go back to the OpenStreetMap. org,
and you find this place, you will find that The Terrace Theater has got a name.
I did that. Me!
I did that to the map. I just did that!
I put that up on there. Hey, you know what?
If I -- that street map is all about everybody doing their bit
and it creates an incredible resource
because everybody else does theirs.
And that is what linked data is all about.
It's about people doing their bit
to produce a little bit, and it all connecting.
That's how linked data works.
You do your bit. Everybody else does theirs.
You may not have lots of data which you have yourself to put on there
but you know to demand it.
And we've practiced that.
I've only told you a very small number of things
There are data in every aspect of our lives,
every aspect of work and pleasure,
and it's not just about the number of places where data comes,
it's about connecting it together.
And when you connect data together, you get power
in a way that doesn't happen just with the web, with documents.
You get this really huge power out of it.
So, we're at the stage now
where we have to do this -- the people who think it's a great idea.
And all the people -- and I think there's a lot of people at TED who do things because --
even though there's not an immediate return on the investment
because it will only really pay off when everybody else has done it --
they'll do it because they're the sort of person who just does things
which would be good if everybody else did them.
OK, so it's called linked data.
I want you to make it.
I want you to demand it.
And I think it's an idea worth spreading.
So, here we go: a flyby of play.
puts a cover story of their February 17th Sunday magazine about play.
Seriously, but dangerously fun.
And a sandbox for new ideas about evolution."
Not bad, except if you look at that cover, what's missing?
You see any adults?
This is a courtyard in Europe,
and a mixture of 124 different kinds of play.
All ages, solo play, body play, games, taunting.
And there it is. And I think this is a typical picture
of what it was like in a courtyard then.
I think we may have lost something in our culture.
what I think is a remarkable sequence.
North of Churchill, Manitoba, in October and November,
there's no ice on Hudson Bay.
And this polar bear that you see, this 1200-pound male,
he's wild and fairly hungry.
And Norbert Rosing, a German photographer,
is there on scene, making a series of photos of these huskies, who are tethered.
And from out of stage left comes this wild, male polar bear,
with a predatory gaze.
Any of you who've been to Africa or had a junkyard dog come after you,
there is a fixed kind of predatory gaze
that you know you're in trouble.
But on the other side of that predatory gaze
is a female husky in a play bow, wagging her tail.
And something very unusual happens.
That fixed behavior -- which is rigid and stereotyped
and ends up with a meal -- changes.
And this polar bear
stands over the husky,
no claws extended, no fangs taking a look.
And they begin an incredible ballet.
This is in nature: it overrides a carnivorous nature
and what otherwise would have been a short fight to the death.
And if you'll begin to look closely at the husky that's bearing her throat to the polar bear,
and look a little more closely, they're in an altered state.
They're in a state of play.
And it's that state
that allows these two creatures to explore the possible.
They are beginning to do something that neither would have done
without the play signals.
And it is a marvelous example
of how a differential in power
can be overridden by a process of nature that's within all of us.
John mentioned that I've done some work with murderers, and I have.
The Texas Tower murderer opened my eyes,
in retrospect, when we studied his tragic mass murder,
to the importance of play,
in that that individual, by deep study,
was found to have severe play deprivation.
Charles Whitman was his name.
And our committee, which consisted of a lot of hard scientists,
did feel at the end of that study
that the absence of play and a progressive suppression of developmentally normal play
led him to be more vulnerable to the tragedy that he perpetrated.
And that finding has stood the test of time --
unfortunately even into more recent times, at Virginia Tech.
sensitized me to the importance of play,
but I didn't really understand what it was.
And it was many years in taking play histories of individuals
before I really began to recognize that I didn't really have a full understanding of it.
And I don't think any of us has a full understanding of it, by any means.
But there are ways of looking at it
that I think can give you -- give us all a taxonomy, a way of thinking about it.
When that mother and infant lock eyes,
and the infant's old enough to have a social smile,
what happens -- spontaneously -- is the eruption of joy on the part of the mother.
And she begins to babble and coo and smile, and so does the baby.
If we've got them wired up with an electroencephalogram,
the right brain of each of them becomes attuned,
so that the joyful emergence of this earliest of play scenes
and the physiology of that is something we're beginning to get a handle on.
builds on this base for us humans.
And so now I'm going to take you through sort of a way of looking at play,
but it's never just singularly one thing.
which is a spontaneous desire to get ourselves out of gravity.
This is a mountain goat.
If you're having a bad day, try this:
jump up and down, wiggle around -- you're going to feel better.
And you may feel like this character,
If its purpose is more important
than the act of doing it, it's probably not play.
And this Japanese macaque has made a snowball,
and he or she's going to roll down a hill.
And -- they don't throw it at each other, but this is a fundamental part of being playful.
The human hand, in manipulation of objects,
is the hand in search of a brain;
the brain is in search of a hand;
and play is the medium by which those two are linked in the best way.
They have located two consultants,
Frank Wilson and Nate Johnson,
who are -- Frank Wilson is a neurologist, Nate Johnson is a mechanic.
He taught mechanics in a high school in Long Beach,
and found that his students were no longer able to solve problems.
And he tried to figure out why. And he came to the conclusion, quite on his own,
that the students who could no longer solve problems, such as fixing cars,
hadn't worked with their hands.
Frank Wilson had written a book called "The Hand."
They got together -- JPL hired them.
even if they're summa cum laude from Harvard or Cal Tech --
if they haven't fixed cars, haven't done stuff with their hands early in life,
played with their hands, they can't problem-solve as well.
So play is practical, and it's very important.
But it has to be safe exploration.
This happens to be OK -- he's an anatomically interested little boy
and that's his mom. Other situations wouldn't be quite so good.
But curiosity, exploration, are part of the play scene.
If you want to belong, you need social play.
And social play is part of what we're about here today,
and is a byproduct of the play scene.
These lionesses, seen from a distance, looked like they were fighting.
But if you look closely, they're kind of like the polar bear and husky:
no claws, flat fur, soft eyes,
open mouth with no fangs, balletic movements,
curvilinear movements -- all specific to play.
And rough-and-tumble play is a great learning medium for all of us.
Preschool kids, for example, should be allowed to dive, hit, whistle,
scream, be chaotic, and develop through that a lot of emotional regulation
and a lot of the other social byproducts -- cognitive, emotional and physical --
that come as a part of rough and tumble play.
Those of you who are from Boston know that this was the moment -- rare --
where the Red Sox won the World Series.
But take a look at the face and the body language of everybody
in this fuzzy picture, and you can get a sense that they're all at play.
I love this picture because my daughter, who's now almost 40, is in this picture,
but it reminds me of her storytelling and her imagination,
her ability to spin yarns at this age -- preschool.
A really important part of being a player
is imaginative solo play.
We all have an internal narrative that's our own inner story.
The unit of intelligibility of most of our brains is the story.
I'm telling you a story today about play.
Well, this bushman, I think, is talking about the fish that got away that was that long,
but it's a fundamental part of the play scene.
Well, a lot.
for the study of felony drunken drivers, and I thought I had a pretty good track record,
and by the time I had spent half an hour talking about play,
it was obvious that they were not -- did not feel that play was serious.
I think that -- that's a few years back -- I think that wave is past,
and the play wave is cresting,
because there is some good science.
Three-dimensional play fires up the cerebellum,
puts a lot of impulses into the frontal lobe --
the executive portion -- helps contextual memory be developed,
and -- and, and, and.
to look at the neuroscience that's associated with play, and to bring together people
who in their individual disciplines hadn't really thought of it that way.
And that's part of what the National Institute for Play is all about.
And this is one of the ways you can study play --
is to get a 256-lead electroencephalogram.
I'm sorry I don't have a playful-looking subject, but it allows mobility,
which has limited the actual study of play.
And we've got a mother-infant play scenario
that we're hoping to complete underway at the moment.
my thoughts about objectifying what play does.
The animal world has objectified it.
In the animal world, if you take rats,
who are hardwired to play at a certain period of their juvenile years
and you suppress play -- they squeak, they wrestle,
they pin each other, that's part of their play.
If you stop that behavior on one group that you're experimenting with,
and you allow it in another group that you're experimenting with,
and then you present those rats
with a cat odor-saturated collar,
they're hardwired to flee and hide.
Pretty smart -- they don't want to get killed by a cat.
So what happens?
They both hide out.
The non-players never come out --
they die.
The players slowly explore the environment,
and begin again to test things out.
That says to me, at least in rats --
and I think they have the same neurotransmitters that we do
and a similar cortical architecture --
that play may be pretty important for our survival.
This took a long time --
I had to get Homer down and put him through the fMRI and the SPECT
and multiple EEGs, but as a couch potato, his brain has shrunk.
And we do know that in domestic animals
and others, when they're play deprived,
they don't -- and rats also -- they don't develop a brain that is normal.
it's depression.
And I think if you think about life without play --
no humor, no flirtation, no movies,
no games, no fantasy and, and, and.
Try and imagine a culture or a life, adult or otherwise
without play.
And the thing that's so unique about our species
is that we're really designed to play through our whole lifetime.
Nobody misses that dog I took a picture of on a Carmel beach a couple of weeks ago.
What's going to follow from that behavior
is play.
And you can trust it.
The basis of human trust is established through play signals.
And we begin to lose those signals, culturally and otherwise, as adults.
That's a shame.
I think we've got a lot of learning to do.
So part of the signaling system of play
has to do with vocal, facial, body, gestural.
You know, you can tell -- and I think when we're getting into collective play,
its really important for groups to gain a sense of safety
through their own sharing of play signals.
but it should be your biological first name and last name.
Because neoteny means the retention of immature qualities into adulthood.
And we are, by physical anthropologists,
by many, many studies, the most neotenous,
the most youthful, the most flexible, the most plastic of all creatures.
And therefore, the most playful.
that I also want to emphasize here,
which is the play history.
Your own personal play history is unique,
and often is not something we think about particularly.
by the name of Kevin Carroll.
Kevin Carroll came from extremely deprived circumstances:
alcoholic mother, absent father, inner-city Philadelphia,
black, had to take care of a younger brother.
Found that when he looked at a playground
out of a window into which he had been confined,
he felt something different.
And so he followed up on it.
And his life -- the transformation of his life
from deprivation and what one would expect -- potentially prison or death --
he become a linguist, a trainer for the 76ers and now is a motivational speaker.
And he gives play as a transformative force
over his entire life.
Those of you who remember Al Gore,
during the first term and then during his successful
but unelected run for the presidency,
may remember him as being kind of wooden and not entirely his own person,
at least in public.
And looking at his history, which is common in the press,
it seems to me, at least -- looking at it from a shrink's point of view --
that a lot of his life was programmed.
Summers were hard, hard work, in the heat of Tennessee summers.
He had the expectations of his senatorial father and Washington, D.C.
And although I think he certainly had the capacity for play --
because I do know something about that --
he wasn't as empowered, I think, as he now is
by paying attention to what is his own passion
and his own inner drive,
which I think has its basis in all of us in our play history.
is to explore backwards as far as you can go
to the most clear, joyful, playful image that you have,
whether it's with a toy, on a birthday or on a vacation.
And begin to build to build from the emotion of that
into how that connects with your life now.
And you'll find, you may change jobs --
which has happened to a number people when I've had them do this --
in order to be more empowered through their play.
Or you'll be able to enrich your life by prioritizing it
and paying attention to it.
the d.school, the design school at Stanford,
thanks to David Kelley and a lot of others
who have been visionary about its establishment,
has allowed a group of us to get together
and create a course called "From Play to Innovation."
And you'll see this course is to investigate
the human state of play, which is kind of like the polar bear-husky state
and its importance to creative thinking:
"to explore play behavior, its development and its biological basis;
to apply those principles, through design thinking,
to promote innovation in the corporate world;
and the students will work with real-world partners
on design projects with widespread application."
We're about two and a half, three months into it, and it's really been fun.
There is our star pupil, this labrador,
who taught a lot of us what a state of play is,
and an extremely aged and decrepit professor in charge there.
And Brendan Boyle, Rich Crandall -- and on the far right is, I think, a person who
So we've had Brendan, who's from IDEO,
and the rest of us sitting aside and watching these students
as they put play principles into practice in the classroom.
And one of their projects was to
see what makes meetings boring,
and to try and do something about it.
So what will follow is a student-made film
about just that.
in which the person is fully immersed in what he or she is doing.
Characterized by a feeling of energized focus,
is that people pack them in one after another,
that they left at their desk.
But it doesn't have to be that way.
at this place called the d.school
designed a meeting that you can literally step out of when it's over.
Take the meeting off, and have peace of mind that you can come back to me.
Because when you need it again,
the meeting is literally hanging in your closet.
Because when you put it on, you immediately get everything you need
to have a fun and productive and useful meeting.
But when you take it off --
that's when the real action happens.
to engage
not in the work-play differential --
where you set aside time to play --
but where your life becomes infused
minute by minute, hour by hour,
with body,
object,
social, fantasy, transformational kinds of play.
And I think you'll have a better and more empowered life.
Thank You.
there may be some temptation on the part of people to look at your work
and go --
I think I've heard this, in my kind of pop psychological understanding of play,
that somehow,
the way animals and humans deal with play,
is that it's some sort of rehearsal for adult activity.
Your work seems to suggest that that is powerfully wrong.
and I think probably because animals have taught us that.
If you stop a cat from playing --
which you can do, and we've all seen how cats bat around stuff --
they're just as good predators as they would be if they hadn't played.
And if you imagine a kid
pretending to be King Kong,
or a race car driver, or a fireman,
they don't all become race car drivers or firemen, you know.
So there's a disconnect between preparation for the future --
which is what most people are comfortable in thinking about play as --
and thinking of it as a separate biological entity.
really changed my perspective from a clinician to what I am now,
which is that play has a biological place,
just like sleep and dreams do.
And if you look at sleep and dreams biologically,
animals sleep and dream,
and they rehearse and they do some other things that help memory
and that are a very important part of sleep and dreams.
creatures with divinely superfluous neurons
will be to play.
And the fact that the polar bear and husky or magpie and a bear
or you and I and our dogs can crossover and have that experience
sets play aside as something separate.
And its hugely important in learning and crafting the brain.
So it's not just something you do in your spare time.
and you have to justify your existence with grants and proposals like everyone else --
how do you prevent --
and some of the data that you've produced, the good science that you're talking about you've produced, is hot to handle.
How do you prevent either the media's interpretation of your work
or the scientific community's interpretation of the implications of your work,
kind of like the Mozart metaphor,
where, "Oh, MRIs show
and make them play for months at a time; they'll all be geniuses and go to Harvard."
How do you prevent people from taking that sort of action
on the data that you're developing?
is to have accumulated the advisers that I have
who go from practitioners --
who can establish through improvisational play or clowning or whatever --
a state of play.
So people know that it's there.
And then you get an fMRI specialist, and you get Frank Wilson,
and you get other kinds of hard scientists, including neuroendocrinologists.
And you get them into a group together focused on play,
and it's pretty hard not to take it seriously.
for the National Science Foundation, National Institute of Mental Health
or anybody else to really look at it in this way seriously.
I mean you don't hear about anything that's like cancer or heart disease
associated with play.
And yet I see it as something that's just as basic for survival -- long term --
as learning some of the basic things about public health.
I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids,
ages six to eight, at a children's museum,
and I brought with me a bag full of legs,
similar to the kinds of things you see up here,
and had them laid out on a table for the kids.
And, from my experience, you know, kids are naturally curious
about what they don't know, or don't understand,
or is foreign to them.
They only learn to be frightened of those differences
when an adult influences them to behave that way,
and maybe censors that natural curiosity,
or you know, reins in the question-asking
in the hopes of them being polite little kids.
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby
with these unruly kids, saying, "Now, whatever you do,
don't stare at her legs."
That's why I was there, I wanted to invite them to look and explore.
So I made a deal with the adults
that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes
on their own.
The doors open, the kids descend on this table of legs,
and they are poking and prodding, and they're wiggling toes,
and they're trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg
to see what happens with that.
And I said, "Kids, really quickly --
I woke up this morning, I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house --
nothing too big, two or three stories --
but, if you could think of any animal, any superhero, any cartoon character,
anything you can dream up right now,
what kind of legs would you build me?"
"No, no, no! Should be a frog!"
"No. It should be Go Go Gadget!"
"No, no, no! It should be the Incredibles."
And other things that I don't -- aren't familiar with.
And then, one eight-year-old said,
"Hey, why wouldn't you want to fly too?"
And the whole room, including me, was like, "Yeah."
(Laughter)
And just like that, I went from being a woman
that these kids would have been trained to see as "disabled"
to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn't have yet.
Somebody that might even be super-abled.
Interesting.
And there's been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is
for both speakers and attendees, and I am no exception.
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life's exploration.
At the time, the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics.
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs
modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah,
which you may have seen on stage yesterday.
And also these very life-like, intrinsically painted silicone legs.
to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community
to come bring their talent to the science and to the art
of building legs.
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form, function and aesthetic,
and assigning them different values.
Well, lucky for me, a lot of people answered that call.
And the journey started, funny enough, with a TED conference attendee --
Chee Pearlman, who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today.
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID,
and she gave me a cover story.
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time;
I'd been accepting numerous invitations to speak
on the design of the cheetah legs around the world.
And people would come up to me after the conference, after my talk,
men and women.
And the conversation would go something like this,
"You know Aimee, you're very attractive.
You don't look disabled."
(Laughter)
I thought, "Well, that's amazing,
because I don't feel disabled."
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation
that could be explored, about beauty.
What does a beautiful woman have to look like?
What is a sexy body?
And interestingly, from an identity standpoint,
what does it mean to have a disability?
I mean, people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do.
Nobody calls her disabled.
(Laughter)
went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen, and photographer Nick Knight,
who were also interested in exploring that conversation.
So, three months after TED I found myself on a plane
to London, doing my first fashion shoot,
which resulted in this cover --
"Fashion-able"?
Three months after that, I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen
on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash.
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots.
Actually, I have them on stage with me:
grapevines, magnolias -- truly stunning.
Poetry matters.
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object
to a realm of art.
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful
into something that invites them to look,
and look a little longer,
and maybe even understand.
The artist Matthew Barney, in his film opus called the "The Cremaster Cycle."
This is where it really hit home for me --
that my legs could be wearable sculpture.
And even at this point, I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness
as the only aesthetic ideal.
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs
even though they're actually optically clear polyurethane,
a.k.a. bowling ball material.
Heavy!
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil
with a potato root system growing in them, and beetroots out the top,
and a very lovely brass toe.
That's a good close-up of that one.
Then another character was a half-woman, half-cheetah --
a little homage to my life as an athlete.
14 hours of prosthetic make-up
to get into a creature that had articulated paws,
claws and a tail that whipped around,
like a gecko.
(Laughter)
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these --
look like jellyfish legs,
also polyurethane.
And the only purpose that these legs can serve,
outside the context of the film,
is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination.
So whimsy matters.
that various people have made for me,
and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet,
and I can change my height --
I have a variable of five different heights.
(Laughter)
Today, I'm 6'1".
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago
at Dorset Orthopedic in England
and when I brought them home to Manhattan,
my first night out on the town, I went to a very fancy party.
And a girl was there who has known me for years
at my normal 5'8".
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me,
and she went, "But you're so tall!"
And I said, "I know. Isn't it fun?"
I mean, it's a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts,
but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams
that I never expected I would ever have.
And I was having fun with it.
And she looked at me,
and she said, "But, Aimee, that's not fair."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And the incredible thing was she really meant it.
It's not fair that you can change your height,
as you want it.
that's when I knew that the conversation with society
has changed profoundly
in this last decade.
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency.
It's a conversation about augmentation.
It's a conversation about potential.
A prosthetic limb doesn't represent the need to replace loss anymore.
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer
has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create
in that space.
So people that society once considered to be disabled
can now become the architects of their own identities
and indeed continue to change those identities
by designing their bodies
from a place of empowerment.
And what is exciting to me so much right now
is that by combining cutting-edge technology --
robotics, bionics --
with the age-old poetry,
we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity.
I think that if we want to discover the full potential
in our humanity,
we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths
and those glorious disabilities that we all have.
I think of Shakespeare's Shylock:
"If you prick us, do we not bleed,
and if you tickle us, do we not laugh?"
It is our humanity,
and all the potential within it,
that makes us beautiful.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I was raised in Seoul, Korea,
and moved to New York City in 1999 to attend college.
I was pre-med at the time,
and I thought I would become a surgeon
because I was interested in anatomy
and dissecting animals really piqued my curiosity.
At the same time, I fell in love with New York City.
I started to realize that I could look at the whole city
as a living organism.
I wanted to dissect it
and look into its unseen layers.
And the way to it, for me,
was through artistic means.
So, eventually I decided to pursue an MFA instead of an M.D.
and in grad school I became interested
in creatures that dwell in the hidden corners of the city.
Most people ignore them or are frightened of them.
But I took a liking to them
because they dwell on the fringes of society.
And even though they're used in labs to promote human lives,
they're also considered pests.
I also started looking around in the city
and trying to photograph them.
One day, in the subway, I was snapping pictures of the tracks
hoping to catch a rat or two,
and a man came up to me and said,
"You can't take photographs here.
The MTA will confiscate your camera."
I was quite shocked by that,
and thought to myself, "Well, OK then.
I'll follow the rats."
Then I started going into the tunnels,
which made me realize that there's a whole new dimension to the city
that I never saw before and most people don't get to see.
who call themselves urban explorers, adventurers, spelunkers,
guerrilla historians, etc.
I was welcomed into this loose, Internet-based network
of people who regularly explore urban ruins
such as abandoned subway stations,
tunnels, sewers, aqueducts,
factories, hospitals, shipyards and so on.
I felt there was something missing in the pictures.
Simply documenting these soon-to-be-demolished structures
wasn't enough for me.
So I wanted to create a fictional character
or an animal that dwells in these underground spaces,
and the simplest way to do it, at the time,
was to model myself.
I decided against clothing
because I wanted the figure to be without any cultural implications
or time-specific elements.
I wanted a simple way to represent a living body
inhabiting these decaying, derelict spaces.
It's now an empty, six-acre lot
waiting for a shopping mall right across from the new Ikea.
I was very fond of this space
because it's the first massive industrial complex I found on my own
that is abandoned.
When I first went in, I was scared,
because I heard dogs barking and I thought they were guard dogs.
But they happened to be wild dogs living there,
and it was right by the water,
so there were swans and ducks swimming around
and trees growing everywhere
and bees nesting in the sugar barrels.
And, in a way, I wanted the human figure in the picture
to become a part of that nature.
When I got comfortable in the space,
it also felt like a big playground.
I would climb up the tanks and hop across exposed beams
as if I went back in time and became a child again.
which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time.
The construction began in 1837.
It lasted about five years.
It got abandoned when the new Croton Aqueducts opened in 1890.
When you go into spaces like this,
you're directly accessing the past,
because they sit untouched for decades.
I love feeling the aura of a space that has so much history.
Instead of looking at reproductions of it at home,
you're actually feeling the hand-laid bricks
and shimmying up and down narrow cracks
and getting wet and muddy
and walking in a dark tunnel with a flashlight.
It was built in the 1930s by Robert Moses.
The murals were done by a graffiti artist
to commemorate the hundreds of homeless people
that got relocated from the tunnel in 1991
when the tunnel reopened for trains.
Walking in this tunnel is very peaceful.
There's nobody around you,
and you hear the kids playing in the park above you,
completely unaware of what's underneath.
I was feeling a lot of anxiety and isolation
because I was in a solitary phase in my life,
and I decided to title my series "Naked City Spleen,"
which references Charles Baudelaire.
"Naked City" is a nickname for New York,
and "Spleen" embodies the melancholia and inertia
that come from feeling alienated in an urban environment.
You see the sunbeams coming from the ventilation ducts
and the train approaching.
I was there alone, setting up,
and a homeless man approached.
I was basically intruding in his living space.
I was really frightened at first,
but I calmly explained to him that I was working on an art project
and he didn't seem to mind
and so I went ahead and put my camera on self-timer
and ran back and forth.
And when I was done, he actually offered me his shirt
to wipe off my feet
and kindly walked me out.
It must have been a very unusual day for him.
(Laughter)
was that a space like that holds so many deleted memories of the city.
That homeless man, to me, really represented
an element of the unconscious of the city.
He told me that he was abused above ground
and was once in Riker's Island,
and at last he found peace and quiet in that space.
The tunnel was once built for the prosperity of the city,
but is now a sanctuary for outcasts,
who are completely forgotten in the average urban dweller's everyday life.
The tunnels are famous for having been used
during the development of the Manhattan Project.
This particular tunnel is interesting
because it shows the original foundations of Bloomingdale Insane Asylum,
which was demolished in 1890
when Columbia moved in.
which was a poorhouse in Staten Island
from the 1890s to the 1930s.
Most of my photos are set in places
that have been abandoned for decades,
but this is an exception.
it's located in Newark.
When I was there three years ago,
the windows were broken and the walls were peeling,
but everything was left there as it was.
You see the autopsy table, morgue trays, x-ray machines
and even used utensils,
which you see on the autopsy table.
I felt that everything could fall into ruins very fast:
your home, your office, a shopping mall, a church --
any man-made structures around you.
I was reminded of how fragile our sense of security is
and how vulnerable people truly are.
and Berlin has become one of my favorite cities.
It's full of history,
and also full of underground bunkers
and ruins from the war.
built in 1885 to house 1,100 people.
I saw the structure while I was on the train,
and I got off at the next station and met people there
that gave me access to their catacomb-like basement,
which was used for ammunition storage during the war
and also, at some point, to hide groups of Jewish refugees.
This is the actual catacombs in Paris.
I explored there extensively
in the off-limits areas
and fell in love right away.
and only about a mile is open to the public as a museum.
The first tunnels date back to 60 B.C.
They were consistently dug as limestone quarries
and by the 18th century,
the caving-in of some of these quarries posed safety threats,
so the government ordered reinforcing of the existing quarries
and dug new observation tunnels
in order to monitor and map the whole place.
It's very dangerous to get lost in there.
And at the same time,
there was a problem in the city with overflowing cemeteries.
So the bones were moved from the cemeteries into the quarries,
making them into the catacombs.
The remains of over six million people are housed in there,
some over 1,300 years old.
This was taken under the Montparnasse Cemetery
where most of the ossuaries are located.
There are also phone cables that were used in the '50s
and many bunkers from the World War II era.
Nearby there's a French bunker,
and the whole tunnel system is so complex
that the two parties never met.
The tunnels are famous for having been used by the Resistance,
which Victor Hugo wrote about in "Les Miserables."
And I saw a lot of graffiti from the 1800s, like this one.
I decided to climb up,
and I climbed a Gothic monument
that's right in the middle of Paris.
This is the Tower of Saint Jacques.
It was built in the early 1500s.
I don't recommend sitting on a gargoyle in the middle of January, naked.
It was not very comfortable. (Laughter)
I never saw a single rat in any of these places,
until recently, when I was in the London sewers.
This was probably the toughest place to explore.
I had to wear a gas mask because of the toxic fumes --
I guess, except for in this picture.
And when the tides of waste matter come in
it sounds as if a whole storm is approaching you.
I've become more interested in capturing movement and texture.
And the 16mm black-and-white film gave a different feel to it.
I adapted and produced "A Dream Play" by August Strindberg.
It was performed last September one time only
in the Atlantic Avenue tunnel in Brooklyn,
which is considered to be the oldest underground train tunnel in the world,
built in 1844.
I've been leaning towards more collaborative projects like these, lately.
But whenever I get a chance I still work on my series.
was the Mayan ruins of Copan, Honduras.
This was taken inside an archaeological tunnel in the main temple.
I feel an obligation to animate and humanize these spaces continually
in order to preserve their memories in a creative way --
before they're lost forever.
Thank you.
is it was taken two days before I was completely paralyzed
and how to overcome these limitations.
The first limitation is the oxygen --
You don't want to drive drunk, you don't want to dive drunk.
is the one I found out the hard way in Palau,
So that's the basic concept we use.
I'll admit, it wasn't exactly the smartest of starts,
but you've got to start somewhere.
and we came up with this really sophisticated-looking rig
all that good stuff.
The problem was it didn't allow us much time.
For all its bulk and size, it only gave us about 15 minutes at most
down at those sorts of depths.
We needed more time. There had to be a better way.
And indeed, there is a better way.
In order to really understand how they do that,
There's a mouthpiece that you put in your mouth,
is this oxygen gas supply cylinder we have here.
where it's easy to reach.
It's got the valves and knobs and things you need
to inject the right gases at the right time.
You also have three microprocessors.
And there are multiple displays, to get the information to the diver.
So we drop in the water and go over the edge of this cliff,
You ever see "The Abyss,"
where Ed Harris is sinking down along the side of the wall?
That's what it feels like. Amazing.
And this kind of habitat just goes on and on and on for miles.
This is Papua, New Guinea.
and you want to assess, how much jeopardy am I really in here,
so we just called it the Dr. Seuss fish,
You have to balance those two goals.
So you can't live your life in fear.
in your future endeavors.
Let's talk trash.
to renounce the powerful conservation ethic
we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity
toward creation of products for peacetime.
Life Magazine helped in this effort
by announcing the introduction of throwaways
that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.
throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent
of plastics recovered in our waste stream.
It's diddly-point-squat.
That's the percentage we recycle.
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water
and does not drive off the oily contaminants
for which it is a sponge.
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets
will be made into fast-track trash.
A large, unruly fraction of our trash
will flow downriver to the sea.
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach
and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.
much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,
here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,
who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.
off the coast of Baja California.
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery
off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,
will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories
from a different plastic, polypropylene.
They will float in seawater,
but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.
that make it to sea solo.
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,
while ours get caught in the California current
and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps
are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,
while ours litter the Philippines.
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone
of the North Pacific Gyre.

A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick

Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying

This is Mae West,
still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.
so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005
I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.
I got plenty of takers.
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.
and put them on display the next Earth Day
at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,
they shook my hand. (Laughter)
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl
from the gyre north of Hawaii
with more plastic than plankton.
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile
produces samples like this.
And this.
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii
it looks like this.
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,
the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.
that contain more plastic than plankton?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,
from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants
up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.
at the base of the food chain,

We did hundreds of necropsies,
and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,
had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.
But no fishmonger on Earth
can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.
The throwaway society cannot be contained --
it has gone global.
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.
We have to throw it away.
Now, the market can do a lot for us,
but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.
the amount of packaging is increasing,
the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,
and it's showing up in the ocean.
Straining the ocean for plastic
would be beyond the budget of any country
and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:
stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,
he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,
in Long Beach, California.
There was gas rationing in 1973.
The energy crisis was in full bore.
to try and solve that crisis.
I had just taken trigonometry in high school,
I learned about the parabola
I took metal shop,
and for this dish in the back of "Popular Science" magazine,
and I got addicted to the IBM PC in 1981.
So much more energy can be stored with fuel than with batteries.
It's been 25 years since I was doing this,
to about four or five dollars a watt, but it stabilized.
A lot of new things are happening to do that,
Of course, inexpensive microprocessors
And I'll show you what we came up with.
Those shapes are parabolas.
They take all the parallel incoming rays and focus it to a single spot.
and for extreme off-axis, it might take three.
On an average adjusted day, a solar cell --
You can buy a two-megahertz microprocessor for a dollar now.
So we can control all 12 of these petals for under 50 dollars
and they had tremendous impact on the world --
And the hot air engine also was not invented by Robert Stirling,
but Robert Stirling came along in 1816 and radically improved it.
has led to hundreds of creative designs over the years
that use the Stirling engine principle.
he just refined it.
He showed it in Paris in 1867, and it was a major achievement
so this was the engine that ended up benefiting from mass production
where all the other engines didn't.
emissions were reduced, tremendous production value.
we concluded that the Stirling engine would be the best one to use.
Normally, efficiency is crucial
Put a flame under it, the piston moves up.
That's the most fundamental heat engine you could have.
That allows you to get the efficiency up
So when the air pushes up to go from the hot end to the cold end,
The exact converse is also true.
So it's a complete reversible cycle,
with the petals and the engine in the center.
This is being run out in the sun,
little sensors that detect the heat when the sunlight strikes them.
Each petal adjusts itself separately to keep the highest temperature on it.
When the sun comes out in the morning, the petals will seek the sun,
You don't have to use it, it will cool itself.
But you can use it to optionally heat hot water
they slow down and do a fine search.
usually when you have your air conditioning on,
but even the green or blue areas are good,
it doesn't mean that you couldn't use solar energy;
you could use it anywhere on Earth.
It's just how many watts do you get per dollar,
to make it have all that energy contained in it.
'Theme and variations' is one of those forms that
require a certain kind of intellectual activity,
because you are always comparing the variation
with the theme that you hold in your mind.
You might say that the theme is nature
to do a series of paintings
that in some way would celebrate the birth of Piero della Francesca.
And it was very difficult for me to imagine
how to paint pictures that were based on Piero
that I would have the same attitude towards looking at Piero della Francesca
as I would if I were looking out a window at a tree.
And that was enormously liberating to me.
Perhaps it's not a very insightful observation,
but that really started me on a path to be able to do a kind of theme and variations
in this case that remarkable painting that's in the Uffizi, "The Duke of Montefeltro,"
who faces his consort, Battista.
Once I realized that I could take some liberties with the subject,
That's the real Piero della Francesca --
one of the greatest portraits in human history.
who's a great, great figure in the Renaissance,
and probably the basis for Machiavelli's "The Prince."
so that for the first time in history, they're facing the same direction.
And then a visitor from another painting by Piero,
And now, four large panels:
lower right.
Since all paintings are inherently abstract to begin with
there doesn't seem to be an argument there.
and I saw this sign,
and I said, "That is a fabulous piece of design."
And she said, "What are you talking about?"
I said, "Well, it's so persuasive,
because the purpose of that sign is to get you into the garage,
and since most people are so suspicious of garages,
and know that they're going to be ripped off,
they use the word 'reliable.'
But everybody says they're reliable.
But, reliable Dutchman" --
Because as soon as you hear the word Dutchman --
which is an archaic word, nobody calls Dutch people "Dutchmen" anymore --
but as soon as you hear Dutchman,
you get this picture of the kid with his finger in the dike,
preventing the thing from falling and flooding Holland, and so on.
And so the entire issue is detoxified by the use of "Dutchman."
Now, if you think I'm exaggerating at all in this,
all you have to do is substitute something else, like "Indonesian."
I do a lot of work for the School of Visual Arts, where I teach,
And so he did.
Nor yet the last to lay the old aside."
I could make nothing of that.
And I really struggled with this one.
And the first thing I did, which was sort of in the absence of another idea,
you've got to keep it moving --
I thought that something would come out of it,
like "Words rule fantastic new old first last Pope"
because it's by Alexander Pope,
but I sort of made a mess out of it,
because you can see the word "new" emerging from the "old."
That's what happens.
There's a relationship between the old and the new;
the new emerges from the context of the old.
I had this other version which had something interesting about it
in terms of being able to put it together in your mind from clues.
The W was clearly a W, the N was clearly an N,
even though they were very fragmentary
and there wasn't a lot of information in it.
Then I got the words "new" and "old"
and now I had regressed back to a point where there seemed to be no return.
which is that I took two drawings I had made for another purpose
and I put them together.
It says "dreams" at the top.
Let it say something about dreams, and come to SVA
and you'll sort of fulfill your dreams."
But, to my credit,
I was so embarrassed about doing that
that I never submitted this sketch.
And, finally, I arrived at the following solution.
Now, it doesn't look terribly interesting,
but it does have something
that distinguishes it from a lot of other posters.
For one thing, it transgresses the idea of what a poster's supposed to be,
which is to be understood and seen immediately, and not explained.
I remember hearing all of you in the graphic arts --
"If you have to explain it, it ain't working."
And one day I woke up and I said, "Well, suppose that's not true?"
This one generates no imagery at all."
I am now exposing myself to my audience, right?
Which is something you never want to do professionally.
"Maybe the words can make the image without anything else happening.
What's the heart of this poem?
Don't be trendy if you want to be serious.
Is doing the poster this way trendy in itself?
like this."
And then I show you a little drawing --
you see, you remember that old thing I discarded?
Well, I found a way to use it.
So, there's that little alternative over there,
and I say, "Not bad," -- criticizing myself --
"but more didactic than visual.
Is this the kind of simple that looks obvious, or the kind that looks profound?
There's a significant difference.
This could be embarrassing.
One is the sort of willingness to expose myself to a critical audience,
and not to suggest that I am confident about what I'm doing.
And as you know, you have to have a front.
to introduce the idea of doubt into graphics.
That can be a big contribution.
The other thing is to actually give you two solutions for the price of one;
you get the big one
and if you don't like that, how about the little one?
And here's just a series of experiments
where I ask the question of -- does a poster have to be square?
Now, this is a little illusion.
That poster is not folded.
It's not folded, that's a photograph
and it's cut on the diagonal.
Same cheap trick in the upper left-hand corner.
And here,
a very peculiar poster because,
simply because of using the isometric perspective in the computer,
it won't sit still in the space.
At times, it seems to be wider at the back than the front,
and then it shifts.
And if you sit here long enough, it'll float off the page into the audience.
But, we don't have time.
a little bit about the nature of perspective,
where the outside shape is determined by the peculiarity of perspective,
but the shape of the bottle -- which is identical to the outside shape --
is seen frontally.
And another piece for the art directors' club
is "Anna Rees" casting long shadows.
This is another poster from the School of Visual Arts.
and I didn't want to be embarrassed,
so I worked very hard on this.
The idea was -- and it was a brilliant idea --
was to have 10 posters distributed throughout the city's subway system
so every time you got on the subway you'd be passing a different poster,
all of which had a different idea of what art is.
and trying to determine what art was.
But then I gave up and I said, "Well, art is whatever."
And as soon as I said that,
I discovered that the word "hat" was hidden in the word "whatever,"
and that led me to the inevitable conclusion.
But then again, it's on my list of didactic posters.
in case you don't get it.
I thought I might use a visual cliche of our time -- Magritte's everyman --
a shadow of its former self.
The phrase 'Art is whatever'
expresses the current inclusiveness that surrounds art-making --
a poetic event that occurs as the shadow man isolates the word 'hat,'
hidden in the word 'whatever.'
and the shape of the thing.
Whatever."
which I still like,
I wanted to use the same phrase.
There were wonderful experiments by Bruno Munari
on letterforms some years ago --
And, of course those are the remains, and they're so labeled.
But what really happens is that you read it as:
"Art is whatever remains."
I'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers
that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years.
And along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization.
Hopefully it won't stutter.
And if we did our jobs well, you won't know that we were even involved.
but you seem to have more hair.
but I was getting younger than everybody else?
and they said I was gonna die soon.
But ... maybe not.
some you could see, some you couldn't.
Hair started growing in all sorts of places,
along with other things.
I felt pretty good, considering.
Many of you, maybe you've seen it or you've heard of the story,
but what you might not know
is that for nearly the first hour of the film,
the main character, Benjamin Button, who's played by Brad Pitt,
is completely computer-generated from the neck up.
Now, there's no use of prosthetic makeup
or photography of Brad superimposed over another actor's body.
We've created a completely digital human head.
This is based on an F. Scott Fitzgerald short story.
It's about a man who's born old and lives his life in reverse.
Now, this movie has floated around Hollywood
for well over half a century,
and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s,
with Ron Howard as the director.
We took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it.
But at the time we had to throw in the towel.
It was deemed impossible.
It was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards.
The human form, in particular the human head,
has been considered the Holy Grail of our industry.
and this time with a director named David Fincher.
Now, Fincher is an interesting guy.
David is fearless of technology,
and he is absolutely tenacious.
And David won't take "no."
And David believed, like we do in the visual effects industry,
that anything is possible
as long as you have enough time, resources and, of course, money.
And so David had an interesting take on the film,
and he threw a challenge at us.
He wanted the main character of the film to be played
from the cradle to the grave by one actor.
It happened to be this guy.
with David, and we ruled out, of course, swapping actors.
That was one idea: that we would have different actors,
and we would hand off from actor to actor.
We realized that prosthetic makeup just wouldn't hold up,
particularly in close-up.
And makeup is an additive process. You have to build the face up.
And David wanted to carve deeply into Brad's face
to bring the aging to this character.
He needed to be a very sympathetic character.
So we decided to cast a series of little people
that would play the different bodies of Benjamin
at the different increments of his life
and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of Brad's head,
aged to appear as Benjamin,
and attach that to the body of the real actor.
Sounded great.
and the fact that this guy is a global icon didn't help either,
because I'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store,
you know -- we see his face constantly.
So there really was no tolerable margin of error.
There were two studios involved: Warner Brothers and Paramount.
And they both believed this would make an amazing film, of course,
but it was a very high-risk proposition.
There was lots of money and reputations at stake.
But we believed that we had a very solid methodology
that might work ...
they wanted some proof.
And so, in 2004, they commissioned us to do a screen test of Benjamin.
And we did it in about five weeks.
But we used lots of cheats and shortcuts.
We basically put something together to get through the meeting.
I'll roll that for you now. This was the first test for Benjamin Button.
And in here, you can see, that's a computer-generated head --
pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor.
And it worked. And it gave the studio great relief.
After many years of starts and stops on this project,
and making that tough decision,
they finally decided to greenlight the movie.
And I can remember, actually, when I got the phone call to congratulate us,
to say the movie was a go,
I actually threw up.
(Laughter)
You know, this is some tough stuff.
and we got everybody together,
and it was really more like therapy in the beginning,
convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this.
We had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character.
And it's not a special effects film; it has to be a man.
We really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program.
And of course, the first step is: admit you've got a problem. (Laughter)
So we had a big problem:
we didn't know how we were going to do this.
But we did know one thing.
Being from the visual effects industry,
we, with David, believed that we now had enough time,
enough resources, and, God, we hoped we had enough money.
And we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence.
of course you've got to break it down.
You take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces
and you start to attack that.
So we had three main areas that we had to focus on.
We needed to make Brad look a lot older --
needed to age him 45 years or so.
And we also needed to make sure that we could take Brad's idiosyncrasies,
his little tics, the little subtleties that make him who he is
and have that translate through our process
so that it appears in Benjamin on the screen.
that could hold up under, really, all conditions.
He needed to be able to walk in broad daylight,
at nighttime, under candlelight,
he had to hold an extreme close-up,
he had to deliver dialogue,
he had to be able to run, he had to be able to sweat,
he had to be able to take a bath, to cry,
he even had to throw up.
Not all at the same time --
but he had to, you know, do all of those things.
We did about 325 shots.
So we needed a system that would allow Benjamin
to do everything a human being can do.
And we realized that there was a giant chasm
between the state of the art of technology in 2004
and where we needed it to be.
I'm sure many of you have seen motion capture.
The state of the art at the time
was something called marker-based motion capture.
I'll give you an example here.
It's basically the idea of, you wear a leotard,
and they put some reflective markers on your body,
and instead of using cameras,
there're infrared sensors around a volume,
and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position
of those markers in real time.
And then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers
and apply them to a computer-generated character.
You can see the computer characters on the right
are having the same complex motion as the dancers.
that were using facial marker tracking,
and that's the idea of putting markers on the human face
and doing the same process.
And as you can see, it gives you a pretty crappy performance.
That's not terribly compelling.
And what we realized
was that what we needed
was the information that was going on between the markers.
We needed the subtleties of the skin.
We needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone.
We needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things.
the technology of the day, the status quo, the state of the art.
So we aborted using motion capture.
And we were now well out of our comfort zone,
and in uncharted territory.
So we were left with this idea
that we ended up calling "technology stew."
We started to look out in other fields.
The idea was that we were going to find
nuggets or gems of technology
that come from other industries like medical imaging,
the video game space,
and re-appropriate them.
And we had to create kind of a sauce.
And the sauce was code in software
that we'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology
to come together and work as one.
done by a gentleman named Dr. Paul Ekman in the early '70s.
He believed that he could, in fact,
catalog the human face.
And he came up with this idea of Facial Action Coding System, or FACS.
He believed that there were 70 basic poses
or shapes of the human face,
and that those basic poses or shapes of the face
can be combined to create infinite possibilities
of everything the human face is capable of doing.
And of course, these transcend age, race, culture, gender.
So this became the foundation of our research as we went forward.
called Contour.
And here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup
stippled on her face.
And now what we're looking at is really creating a surface capture
as opposed to a marker capture.
The subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras,
and those cameras can, frame-by-frame,
reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject's doing at the moment.
So, effectively, you get 3D data in real time of the subject.
And if you look in a comparison,
on the left, we see what volumetric data gives us
and on the right you see what markers give us.
So, clearly, we were in a substantially better place for this.
But these were the early days of this technology,
and it wasn't really proven yet.
We measure complexity and fidelity of data
in terms of polygonal count.
And so, on the left, we were seeing 100,000 polygons.
We could go up into the millions of polygons.
It seemed to be infinite.
This was the breakthrough.
This is when we're like, "OK, we're going to be OK,
This is actually going to work."
And the "Aha!" was, what if we could take Brad Pitt,
and we could put Brad in this device,
and use this Contour process,
and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup
and put him under the black lights,
and we could, in fact, scan him in real time
performing Ekman's FACS poses.
Right? So, effectively,
we ended up with a 3D database
of everything Brad Pitt's face is capable of doing.
(Laughter)
into smaller pieces and components of his face.
So we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes,
a complete database of all possibilities
that his face is capable of doing.
We need to put another 40 years on him at this point.
We brought in Rick Baker,
and Rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus
of our industry.
And we also brought in a gentleman named Kazu Tsuji,
and Kazu Tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time.
And we commissioned them to make a maquette,
or a bust, of Benjamin.
So, in the spirit of "The Great Unveiling" -- I had to do this --
I had to unveil something.
So this is Ben 80.
We created three of these:
there's Ben 80, there's Ben 70, there's Ben 60.
And this really became the template for moving forward.
So, in fact, anatomically, it is correct.
The eyes, the jaw, the teeth:
everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has.
We have these maquettes scanned into the computer
at very high resolution --
enormous polygonal count.
And so now we had three age increments of Benjamin
in the computer.
We went through this process, then, called retargeting.
This is Brad doing one of the Ekman FACS poses.
And here's the resulting data that comes from that,
the model that comes from that.
Retargeting is the process of transposing that data
onto another model.
And because the life cast, or the bust -- the maquette -- of Benjamin
was made from Brad,
we could transpose the data of Brad at 44
onto Brad at 87.
So now, we had a 3D database of everything Brad Pitt's face can do
at age 87, in his 70s and in his 60s.
So while all that's going on,
we're down in New Orleans and locations around the world.
And we shot our body actors,
and we shot them wearing blue hoods.
So these are the gentleman who played Benjamin.
And the blue hoods helped us with two things:
one, we could easily erase their heads;
and we also put tracking markers on their heads
so we could recreate the camera motion
and the lens optics from the set.
And so we edited the footage that was shot on location
with the rest of the cast and the body actors
and about six months later
we brought Brad onto a sound stage in Los Angeles
and he watched on the screen.
His job, then, was to become Benjamin.
And so we looped the scenes.
He watched again and again.
We encouraged him to improvise.
And he took Benjamin into interesting and unusual places
that we didn't think he was going to go.
We shot him with four HD cameras
so we'd get multiple views of him
and then David would choose the take of Brad being Benjamin
that he thought best matched the footage
with the rest of the cast.
And so here, you can see again, the chosen take.
And you are seeing, now, that data being transposed on to Ben 87.
And so, what's interesting about this is
we used something called image analysis,
which is taking timings from different components of Benjamin's face.
And so we could choose, say, his left eyebrow.
And the software would tell us that, well,
in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here,
and it concludes moving in frame 32.
And so we could choose numbers of positions on the face
to pull that data from.
that secret sauce was, effectively, software that allowed us to
match the performance footage of Brad
in live action with our database of aged Benjamin,
the FACS shapes that we had.
On a frame-by-frame basis,
we could actually reconstruct a 3D head
that exactly matched the performance of Brad.
And here you can see the body actor.
And then this is what we called the "dead head," no reference to Jerry Garcia.
now with the timings of the performance.
And then, again, the final shot.
It was a long process.
(Applause)
because we could do a whole TEDTalk on the next several slides.
So really, a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment
for every single location that Benjamin had to appear
so that we could put Ben's head into any scene
and it would exactly match the lighting that's on the other actors
in the real world.
We found the old adage, you know,
"The eyes are the window to the soul,"
absolutely true.
So the key here was to keep everybody looking in Ben's eyes.
And if you could feel the warmth, and feel the humanity,
and feel his intent coming through the eyes,
then we would succeed.
So we had one person focused on the eye system
for almost two full years.
We worked from dental molds of Brad.
We had to age the teeth over time.
There was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue.
We had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months.
He was very popular.
The skin had to be absolutely accurate.
He's also in an old age home, he's in a nursing home
around other old people,
so he had to look exactly the same as the others.
So, lots of work on skin deformation,
you can see in some of these cases it works,
in some cases it looks bad.
This is a very, very, very early test in our process.
So, effectively we created a digital puppet
that Brad Pitt could operate with his own face.
There were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior
or enhance his performance.
that we ended up calling "the digital Botox effect."
So, as things went through this process,
Fincher would always say, "It sandblasts the edges off of the performance."
And thing our process and the technology couldn't do,
is they couldn't understand intent,
the intent of the actor.
So it sees a smile as a smile.
It doesn't recognize an ironic smile, or a happy smile,
or a frustrated smile.
So it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another.
and all the technology "emotion capture,"
as opposed to just motion capture.
Take another look.
and they said I was gonna die soon,
but ... maybe not.
(Applause)
it really took 155 people over two years,
and we didn't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut.
But, that is Benjamin. Thank you.
So, my question:
ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,
ideas that have vanished in history,
every book that you've read,
every poem, every laugh, every tear --
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.

imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean
by what we put into it or by what we took out of it.
It seemed, at that time, to be a sea of Eden,
but now we know, and now we are facing paradise lost.
my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us,
and to consider why it matters that in 50 years, we've lost --
actually, we've taken, we've eaten --
more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea;
why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared;
why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific
should concern not only the creatures that are dying,
but it really should concern you.
It does concern you, as well.
asking why we didn't do something on our watch
to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean
while there still was time.
Well, now is that time.
I hope for your help
to explore and protect the wild ocean
in ways that will restore the health and,
in so doing, secure hope for humankind.
Health to the ocean means health for us.
and other sea creatures
in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.
And I hope, Jill, that someday
we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet.
it all began in 1953
when I first tried scuba.
It's when I first got to know fish swimming
in something other than lemon slices and butter.
I actually love diving at night;
you see a lot of fish then that you don't see in the daytime.
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970,
when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time --
at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon.
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor
while using this personal submersible called Jim.
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down.
It's one of my favorite bathing suits.
and I've started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search
to design and build systems
to access the deep sea.
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition,
the Sustainable Seas expeditions,
using these little subs.
They're so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it.
And I'm living proof.
Astronauts and aquanauts alike
really appreciate the importance of air, food, water, temperature --
all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea.
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain
how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system
and then do everything he could
to take care of his life support system;
and then he pointed to this and he said, "Life support system."
We need to learn everything we can about it
and do everything we can to take care of it.
none without water."
Ninety-seven percent of Earth's water is ocean.
No blue, no green.
If you think the ocean isn't important,
imagine Earth without it.
Mars comes to mind.
No ocean, no life support system.
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank
and I showed this amazing image of Earth
and I said, "There it is! The World Bank!"
That's where all the assets are!
And we've been trawling them down
much faster than the natural systems can replenish them.
With every drop of water you drink,
every breath you take,
you're connected to the sea.
No matter where on Earth you live.
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea.
Over time, most of the planet's organic carbon
has been absorbed and stored there,
mostly by microbes.
The ocean drives climate and weather,
stabilizes temperature, shapes Earth's chemistry.
Water from the sea forms clouds
that return to the land and the seas
as rain, sleet and snow,
and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world,
maybe in the universe.
No water, no life;
no blue, no green.
that the Earth -- all of it: the oceans, the skies --
are so vast and so resilient
it doesn't matter what we do to it.
That may have been true 10,000 years ago,
and maybe even 1,000 years ago
but in the last 100, especially in the last 50,
we've drawn down the assets,
the air, the water, the wildlife
that make our lives possible.
New technologies are helping us to understand
the nature of nature;
the nature of what's happening,
showing us our impact on the Earth.
I mean, first you have to know that you've got a problem.
And fortunately, in our time,
we've learned more about the problems than in all preceding history.
And with knowing comes caring.
And with caring, there's hope
that we can find an enduring place for ourselves
within the natural systems that support us.
But first we have to know.
who's the head of Google Earth,
and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands
and go exploring vicariously.
But I asked him: "When are you going to finish it?
You did a great job with the land, the dirt.
What about the water?"
Since then, I've had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers,
with DOER Marine, with National Geographic,
with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world,
ones that we could enlist,
to put the ocean in Google Earth.
And as of just this week, last Monday,
Google Earth is now whole.
we can find the nearby aquarium,
we can look at where we're sitting,
and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium, the ocean,
and California's four national marine sanctuaries,
and the new network of state marine reserves
that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets
We can flit over to Hawaii
and see the real Hawaiian Islands:
not just the little bit that pokes through the surface,
but also what's below.
To see -- wait a minute, we can go kshhplash! --
right there, ha --
under the ocean, see what the whales see.
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands.
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth
and visit with humpback whales.
These are the gentle giants that I've had the pleasure of meeting face to face
many times underwater.
There's nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale.
seven miles down, the Mariana Trench,
where only two people have ever been.
Imagine that. It's only seven miles,
but only two people have been there, 49 years ago.
One-way trips are easy.
We need new deep-diving submarines.
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration?
We need to see deep trenches, the undersea mountains,
and understand life in the deep sea.
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole.
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century.
That's bad news for the polar bears.
That's bad news for us too.
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming,
it's also changing ocean chemistry,
making the sea more acidic.
That's bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton.
Also it's bad news for us.
We're putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic
and other trash into the sea.
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets,
gear that continues to kill.
We're clogging the ocean, poisoning the planet's circulatory system,
and we're taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife,
all carbon-based units.
Barbarically, we're killing sharks for shark fin soup,
undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry
and drive the carbon cycle, the nitrogen cycle,
the oxygen cycle, the water cycle --
our life support system.
We're still killing bluefin tuna; truly endangered
and much more valuable alive than dead.
All of these parts are part of our life support system.
We kill using long lines, with baited hooks every few feet
that may stretch for 50 miles or more.
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor
like bulldozers, taking everything in their path.
in China, the North Sea, the Gulf of Mexico --
shaking the foundation of our life support system,
leaving plumes of death in their path.
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi,
or swordfish steak, or shrimp cocktail,
whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean --
think of the real cost.
For every pound that goes to market,
more than 10 pounds, even 100 pounds,
may be thrown away as bycatch.
This is the consequence of not knowing
that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea.
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife
from 1900 to 2000.
The highest concentrations are in red.
In my lifetime, imagine,
90 percent of the big fish have been killed.
Most of the turtles, sharks, tunas and whales
are way down in numbers.
Ten percent of the big fish still remain.
There are still some blue whales.
There are still some krill in Antarctica.
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay.
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape,
a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet.
There's still time, but not a lot,
to turn things around.
But business as usual means that in 50 years,
there may be no coral reefs --
and no commercial fishing, because the fish will simply be gone.
Imagine the ocean without fish.
Imagine what that means to our life support system.
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too,
but the problems are more obvious,
and some actions are being taken to protect trees, watersheds and wildlife.
the United States began establishing a system of parks
that some say was the best idea America ever had.
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected:
safeguarding biodiversity, providing a carbon sink,
generating oxygen, protecting watersheds.
And, in 1972, this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea,
National Marine Sanctuaries.
That's another great idea.
The good news is
that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea, around the world,
that have some kind of protection.
And you can find them on Google Earth.
The bad news is
that you have to look hard to find them.
In the last three years, for example,
the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments.
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent
to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected, globally.
Protected areas do rebound,
but it takes a long time to restore
50-year-old rockfish or monkfish, sharks or sea bass,
or 200-year-old orange roughy.
We don't consume 200-year-old cows or chickens.
Protected areas provide hope
that the creatures of Ed Wilson's dream
of an encyclopedia of life, or the census of marine life,
will live not just as a list,
a photograph, or a paragraph.
that is open to fishing -- and mining, and drilling, and dumping, and whatever --
to search out hope spots,
and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future.
Such as the Arctic --
we have one chance, right now, to get it right.
Or the Antarctic, where the continent is protected,
but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill, whales and fish.
Sargasso Sea's three million square miles of floating forest
is being gathered up to feed cows.
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected,
but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing.
It's true too in Argentina
on the Patagonian shelf, which is now in serious trouble.
The high seas, where whales, tuna and dolphins travel --
the largest, least protected, ecosystem on Earth,
filled with luminous creatures,
living in dark waters that average two miles deep.
They flash, and sparkle, and glow
with their own living light.
The next 10 years may be the most important,
and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have
to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life.
To cope with climate change, we need new ways to generate power.
We need new ways, better ways, to cope with poverty, wars and disease.
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place.
But, nothing else will matter
if we fail to protect the ocean.
Our fate and the ocean's are one.
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above.
with a world conservation union, the IUCN,
is underway to protect biodiversity,
to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change,
on the high seas and in coastal areas,
wherever we can identify critical places.
New technologies are needed to map, photograph and explore
the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see.
The goal is to protect biodiversity,
to provide stability and resilience.
We need deep-diving subs,
new technologies to explore the ocean.
We need, maybe, an expedition --
a TED at sea --
that could help figure out the next steps.
I wish you would use all means at your disposal --
films, expeditions, the web, new submarines --
and campaign to ignite public support
for a global network of marine protected areas --
hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean,
the blue heart of the planet.
How much?
Some say 10 percent, some say 30 percent.
You decide: how much of your heart do you want to protect?
Whatever it is,
a fraction of one percent is not enough.
My wish is a big wish,
but if we can make it happen, it can truly change the world,
and help ensure the survival
of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species;
that would be us.
For the children of today,
for tomorrow's child:
as never again, now is the time.
Chris Anderson: And now we go live to Caracas
(Music)
(Applause)
We can speak only with music.
We are very happy
because we have the opportunity
to have this angel in the world --
not only in our country, Venezuela,
but in our world.
He has given us the possibility
We hope to have, our Maestro,
to have orchestras in all the countries
in all Americas.
And we want to play a little piece for you
by one of the most important composers
(Music)
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: Let's now see the extraordinary speech
that we captured a couple weeks ago.
I am overjoyed today
at being awarded the TED Prize
on behalf of all
the distinguished music teachers,
artists and educators from Venezuela
who have selflessly and loyally accompanied me for 35 years
in founding, growing and developing in Venezuela
the National System of Youth and Children's Orchestras and Choirs.
in my early childhood,
I always wanted to be a musician,
and, thank God, I made it.
From my teachers, my family and my community,
I had all the necessary support to become a musician.
All my life I've dreamed
that all Venezuelan children
have the same opportunity that I had.
From that desire and from my heart
stemmed the idea to make music
a deep and global reality for my country.
Because the rehearsal meant a great challenge to me.
I had received a donation of 50 music stands
to be used by 100 boys in that rehearsal.
and I said to myself,
"Do I close the program or multiply these kids?"
into one of the leading orchestras in the world.
Two months ago, I remembered that promise I made,
when a distinguished English critic
published an article in the London Times,
asking who could be the winner of the Orchestra World Cup.
He mentioned four great world orchestras,
and the fifth one was Venezuela's Youth Symphony Orchestra.
Today we can say
that art in Latin America
is no longer a monopoly of elites
and that it has become a social right,
a right for all the people.
nor white or black, nor if you have money or not.
Simply, if you are talented,
of U.S. and Europe,
we saw how our music moved young audiences
to the bottom of their souls,
how children and adolescents rushed up to the stage
to receive the jackets from our musicians,
how the standing ovations, sometimes 30 minutes long,
seemed to last forever,
and how the public, after the concert was over,
went out into the street to greet our young people in triumph.
This meant not only an artistic triumph,
but also a profound emotional sympathy
between the public of the most advanced nations of the world
and the musical youth of Latin America,
as seen in Venezuela,
giving these audiences a message of music, vitality, energy,
enthusiasm and strength.
are much more than artistic structures.
They are examples and schools of social life,
because to sing and to play together
means to intimately coexist
toward perfection and excellence,
following a strict discipline of organization and coordination
in order to seek the harmonic interdependence
of voices and instruments.
That's how they build a spirit of solidarity
and fraternity among them,
develop their self-esteem
and foster the ethical and aesthetical values
related to the music in all its senses.
This is why music is immensely important
in the awakening of sensibility, in the forging of values
and in the training of youngsters
to teach other kids.
music is life.
Nothing else.
Music is life.
and they are all important and of great significance to me.
Let me mention the case of Edicson Ruiz.
He is a boy from a parish in Caracas
who passionately attended to his double bass lessons
at the San Agustin's Junior Orchestra.
With his effort,
and the support of his mother, his family and his community,
he became a principal member
in the double bass segment of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra.
We have another well-known case -- Gustavo Dudamel.
He started as a boy member of the children's orchestra
in his hometown, Barquisimeto.
There, he grew as a violinist and as a conductor.
He became the conductor of Venezuela's junior orchestras,
and today conducts the world's greatest orchestras.
He is the musical director of Los Angeles Philharmonic,
and is still the overall leader of Venezuela's junior orchestras.
He was the conductor of the Gothenburg Symphony Orchestra,
and he's an unbeatable example
for young musicians in Latin America and the world.
is based on a new and flexible managing style
adapted to the features of each community and region,
and today attends to 300,000 children of the lower and middle class
all over Venezuela.
It's a program of social rescue
and deep cultural transformation
designed for the whole Venezuelan society
with absolutely no distinctions whatsoever,
but emphasizing the vulnerable and endangered social groups.
in the personal/social circle,
in the family circle and in the community.
In the personal/social circle,
the children in the orchestras and choirs
develop their intellectual and emotional side.
The music becomes a source
for developing the dimensions of the human being,
thus elevating the spirit
and leading man to a full development of his personality.
So, the emotional and intellectual profits are huge --
the acquisition of leadership, teaching and training principles,
the sense of commitment, responsibility,
generosity and dedication to others,
and the individual contribution to achieve great collective goals.
All this leads to the development of self-esteem and confidence.
insisted on something that always impressed me:
the most miserable and tragic thing about poverty
is not the lack of bread or roof,
but the feeling of being no-one --
the feeling of not being anyone,
the lack of identification,
the lack of public esteem.
That's why the child's development
in the orchestra and the choir
provides him with a noble identity
and makes him a role model for his family and community.
It makes him a better student at school
because it inspires in him a sense of responsibility,
perseverance and punctuality that will greatly help him at school.
The child becomes a role model for both his parents,
and this is very important for a poor child.
Once the child discovers he is important to his family,
he begins to seek new ways of improving himself
and hopes better for himself and his community.
Also, he hopes for social and economic improvements for his own family.
All this makes up a constructive and ascending social dynamic.
The large majority of our children belong, as I already mentioned,
to the most vulnerable strata of the Venezuelan population.
That encourages them to embrace new dreams, new goals,
and progress in the various opportunities
that music has to offer.
The spontaneity music has
excludes it as a luxury item and makes it a patrimony of society.
It's what makes a child play a violin at home,
while his father works in his carpentry.
It's what makes a little girl play the clarinet at home,
while her mother does the housework.
The idea is that the families join with pride and joy
in the activities of the orchestras and the choirs
that their children belong to.
The huge spiritual world that music produces in itself,
which also lies within itself,
ends up overcoming material poverty.
From the minute a child's taught how to play an instrument,
he's no longer poor.
He becomes a child in progress heading for a professional level,
who'll later become a full citizen.
Needless to say that music is the number one prevention
against prostitution, violence, bad habits,
and everything degrading in the life of a child.
said that the world was suffering a huge spiritual crisis.
Not an economic or social crisis, but a spiritual one.
I believe that to confront such a crisis,
only art and religion can give proper answers to humanity,
to mankind's deepest aspirations,
and to the historic demands of our times.
Education -- the synthesis of wisdom and knowledge --
is the means to strive for a more perfect, more aware,
more noble and more just society.
for its open and generous promotion of young values.
We hope that TED can contribute in a full and fundamental way
to the building of this new era in the teaching of music,
in which the social, communal, spiritual and vindicatory aims
of the child and the adolescent
become a beacon and a goal for a vast social mission.
No longer putting society at the service of art,
and much less at the services of monopolies of the elite,
but instead art at the service of society,
at the service of the weakest, at the service of the children,
at the service of the sick, at the service of the vulnerable,
and at the service of all those who cry for vindication
through the spirit of their human condition
and the raising up of their dignity.
We are going live to Caracas
to hear Maestro Abreu's TED Prize wish.
I wish that you'll help to create and document
a special training program
for 50 gifted young musicians,
passionate about their art and social justice,
and dedicated to bringing El Sistema to the United States
and other countries.
Thank you very much.
There's a great big elephant in the room called the economy.
So let's start talking about that.
I wanted to give you a current picture of the economy.
That's what I have behind myself.
And what you have to think about is,
when you're dancing in the flames, what's next?
So what I'm going to try to do in the next 17 and a half minutes
is I'm going to talk first about the flames --
where we are in the economy --
and then I'm going to take three trends
that have taken place at TED over the last 25 years
and that will take place in this conference
and I will try and bring them together.
And I will try and give you a sense of what the ultimate reboot looks like.
Those three trends are
the ability to engineer cells,
the ability to engineer tissues,
and robots.
And somehow it will all make sense.
There's a couple of really big problems that are still sitting there.
One is leverage.
And the problem with leverage is
it makes the U.S. financial system look like this.
That means for every dollar you deposit, it loans out about nine or 10.
A normal investment bank is not a deposit bank,
it's an investment bank;
it has 15 to 20 times.
It turns out that B of A in September had 32 times.
And your friendly Citibank had 47 times.
Oops.
That means every bad loan goes bad 47 times over.
And that, of course, is the reason why all of you
are making such generous and wonderful donations
to these nice folks.
And as you think about that,
you've got to wonder: so what do banks have in store for you now?
It ain't pretty.
We all love Santa Claus, right?
But the problem with Santa Clause is,
if you look at the mandatory spending of what these folks have been doing
and promising folks,
it turned out that in 1967, 38 percent was mandatory spending
on what we call "entitlements."
And then by 2007 it was 68 percent.
And we weren't supposed to run into 100 percent until about 2030.
Except we've been so busy giving away a trillion here, a trillion there,
that we've brought that date of reckoning forward
to about 2017.
And we thought we were going to be able to lay these debts off on our kids,
but, guess what?
We're going to start to pay them.
And the problem with this stuff is, now that the bill's come due,
it turns out Santa isn't quite as cute when it's summertime.
Right?
This guy runs the China Investment Corporation.
He is the main buyer of U.S. Treasury bonds.
And he gave an interview in December.
Here's his first bit of advice.
And here's his second bit of advice.
And, by the way,
the Chinese Prime Minister reiterated this at Davos last Sunday.
This stuff is getting serious enough
that if we don't start paying attention to the deficit,
we're going to end up losing the dollar.
And then all bets are off.
I think I can safely say
that I'm the only trillionaire in this room.
This is an actual bill.
And it's 10 triliion dollars.
The only problem with this bill is it's not really worth very much.
That was eight bucks last week, four bucks this week,
a buck next week.
And that's what happens to currencies when you don't stand behind them.
So the next time somebody as cute as this shows up on your doorstep,
and sometimes this creature's called Chrysler and sometimes Ford and sometimes ... whatever you want --
you've just got to say no.
And you've got to start banishing a word that's called "entitlement."
And the reason we have to do that in the short term
is because we have just run out of cash.
The orange slice is what's discretionary.
Everything else is mandated.
It makes no difference if we cut out the bridges to Alaska in the overall scheme of things.
So what we have to start thinking about doing
is capping our medical spending
because that's a monster that's simply going to eat the entire budget.
We've got to start thinking about asking people
to retire a little bit later.
If you're 60 to 65 you retire on time.
Your 401(k) just got nailed.
If you're 50 to 60 we want you to work two years more.
If you're under 50 we want you to work four more years.
The reason why that's reasonable is,
when your grandparents were given Social Security,
they got it at 65 and were expected to check out at 68.
Sixty-eight is young today.
We've also got to cut the military about three percent a year.
We've got to quit borrowing as much,
because otherwise the interest is going to eat that whole pie.
And we've got to end up with a smaller government.
And if we don't start changing this trend line,
we are going to lose the dollar
and start to look like Iceland.
I got what you're thinking.
This is going to happen when hell freezes over.
But let me remind you this December it did snow in Vegas.
So, Japan had a fiscal real estate crisis
back in the late '80s.
And its 225 largest companies today
are worth one quarter of what they were 18 years ago.
We don't fix this now,
how would you like to see a Dow 3,500 in 2026?
Because that's the consequence of not dealing with this stuff.
And unless you want this person
to not just become the CFO of Florida, but the United States,
we'd better deal with this stuff.
That's the short term. That's the flame part.
That's the financial crisis.
that we need to talk about.
That wave is much larger, much more powerful,
and that's of course the wave of technology.
And what's really important in this stuff is,
as we cut, we also have to grow.
Among other things, because startup companies
are .02 percent of U.S. GDP investmentm
and they're about 17.8 percent of output.
It's groups like that in this room that generate the future of the U.S. economy.
And that's what we've got to keep growing.
We don't have to keep growing these bridges to nowhere.
So let's bring a romance novelist into this conversation.
And that's where these three trends come together.
That's where the ability to engineer microbes,
the ability to engineer tissues,
and the ability to engineer robots
begin to lead to a reboot.
And let me recap some of the stuff you've seen.
and showed you the first fully programmable cell that acts like hardware
where you can insert DNA and have it boot up as a different species.
In parallel, the folks at MIT
have been building a standard registry of biological parts.
So think of it as a Radio Shack for biology.
You can go out and get your proteins, your RNA, your DNA, whatever.
And start building stuff.
In 2006 they brought together high school students and college students
and started to build these little odd creatures.
They just happened to be alive instead of circuit boards.
So, cells have this cycle.
First they don't grow.
Then they grow exponentially.
Then they stop growing.
Graduate students wanted a way of telling which stage they were in.
So they engineered these cells
so that when they're growing in the exponential phase,
they would smell like wintergreen.
And when they stopped growing they would smell like bananas.
And you could tell very easily when your experiment was working
and wasn't, and where it was in the phase.
Twenty-one countries came together. Dozens of teams.
They started competing.
The team from Rice University started to engineer the substance in red wine
that makes red wine good for you
into beer.
So you take resveratrol and you put it into beer.
Of course, one of the judges is wandering by, and he goes,
"Wow! Cancer-fighting beer! There is a God."
They tried to engineer bacterias in such a way
that they would act as your kidneys.
Four years ago, I showed you this picture.
And people oohed and ahhed,
because Cliff Tabin had been able to grow an extra wing on a chicken.
And that was very cool stuff back then.
But now moving from bacterial engineering to tissue engineering,
let me show you what's happened in that period of time.
An almost-extinct animal from Xochimilco, Mexico
called an axolotl
that can re-generate its limbs.
You can freeze half its heart. It regrows.
You can freeze half the brain. It regrows.
It's almost like leaving Congress.
(Laughter)
But now, you don't have to have the animal itself to regenerate,
because you can build cloned mice molars in Petri dishes.
And, of course if you can build mice molars in Petri dishes,
you can grow human molars in Petri dishes.
This should not surprise you, right?
I mean, you're born with no teeth.
You give away all your teeth to the tooth fairy.
You re-grow a set of teeth.
But then if you lose one of those second set of teeth, they don't regrow,
unless, if you're a lawyer.
we know how to grow teeth, and therefore we can take adult stem teeth,
put them on a biodegradable mold, re-grow a tooth,
and simply implant it.
And we can do it with other things.
So, a Spanish woman who was dying of T.B. had a donor trachea,
they took all the cells off the trachea,
they spraypainted her stem cells onto that cartilage.
She regrew her own trachea,
and 72 hours later it was implanted.
She's now running around with her kids.
This is going on in Tony Atala's lab in Wake Forest
where he is re-growing ears for injured soldiers,
and he's also re-growing bladders.
So there are now nine women walking around Boston
with re-grown bladders,
which is much more pleasant than walking around with a whole bunch of plastic bags
for the rest of your life.
I mean, you understand where this story's going.
But, I mean it gets more interesting.
Last year, this group was able to take all the cells off a heart,
leaving just the cartilage.
Then, they sprayed stem cells onto that heart, from a mouse.
Those stem cells self-organized, and that heart started to beat.
Life happens.
This was done in Japan and in the U.S., published at the same time,
and it rebooted skin cells into stem cells, last year.
That meant that you can take the stuff right here,
and turn it into almost anything in your body.
And this is becoming common, it's moving very quickly,
it's moving in a whole series of places.
Those of us of a certain age grew up expecting that by now
we would have Rosie the Robot from "The Jetsons" in our house.
And all we've got is a Roomba.
(Laughter)
We also thought we'd have this robot to warn us of danger.
Didn't happen.
And these were robots engineered for a flat world, right?
So, Rosie runs around on skates
and the other one ran on flat threads.
If you don't have a flat world, that's not good,
which is why the robot's we're designing today are a little different.
And this is about as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
O.K., so let me remind you, a Turing test is where you've got a wall,
you're talking to somebody on the other side of the wall,
and when you don't know if that thing is human or animal --
that's when computers have reached human intelligence.
This is not an intelligence Turing rest,
but this is as close as you can get to a physical Turing test.
And this stuff is moving very quickly,
and by the way, that thing can carry about 350 pounds of weight.
These are not the only interesting robots.
You've also got flies, the size of flies,
that are being made by Robert Wood at Harvard.
You've got Stickybots that are being made at Stanford.
And as you bring these things together,
as you bring cells, biological tissue engineering and mechanics together,
you begin to get some really odd questions.
who had several world records in the Special Olympics,
tried to run in the normal Olympics.
The only issue with Oscar Pistorius
is he was born without bones in the lower part of his legs.
He came within about a second of qualifying.
He sued to be allowed to run,
and he won the suit,
but didn't qualify by time.
Next Olympics, you can bet that Oscar, or one of Oscar's successors,
is going to make the time.
And two or three Olympics after that, they are going to be unbeatable.
to take people who are profoundly deaf, who can now begin to hear --
I mean, remember the evolution of hearing aids, right?
I mean, your grandparents had these great big cones,
and then your parents had these odd boxes
that would squawk at odd times during dinner,
and now we have these little buds that nobody sees.
And now you have cochlear implants
that go into people's heads and allow the deaf to begin to hear.
Now, they can't hear as well as you and I can.
But, in 10 or 15 machine generations they will,
and these are machine generations, not human generations.
And about two or three years after they can hear as well as you and I can,
they'll be able to hear maybe how bats sing, or how whales talk,
or how dogs talk, and other types of tonal scales.
They'll be able to focus their hearing,
they'll be able to increase the sensitivity, decrease the sensitivity,
do a series of things that we can't do.
This is a group in Germany that's beginning to engineer eyes
so that people who are blind can begin to see light and dark.
Very primitive.
And then they'll be able to see shape.
And then they'll be able to see color, and then they'll be able to see in definition,
and one day, they'll see as well as you and I can.
And a couple of years after that, they'll be able to see in ultraviolet,
they'll be able to see in infrared, they'll be able to focus their eyes,
they'll be able to come into a microfocus.
They'll do stuff you and I can't do.
All of these things are coming together,
as we worry about the flames of the present,
because next week is the 200th anniversary of Darwin's birth.
And it's the 150th anniversary of the publication of "The Origin of Species."
And Darwin, of course, argued that evolution is a natural state.
It is a natural state in everything that is alive, including hominids.
There have actually been 22 species of hominids
that have been around, have evolved, have wandered in different places,
have gone extinct.
It is common for hominids to evolve.
And that's the reason why, as you look at the hominid fossil record,
erectus, and heidelbergensis, and floresiensis, and Neanderthals,
not one.
here's a brief history of the universe.
The universe was created 13.7 billion years ago,
and then you created all the stars, and all the planets,
and all the galaxies, and all the Milky Ways.
And then you created Earth about 4.5 billion years ago,
and then you got life about four billion years ago,
and then you got hominids about 0.006 billion years ago,
and then you got our version of hominids about 0.0015 billion years ago.
Ta-dah!
Maybe the reason for thr creation of the universe,
and all the galaxies, and all the planets, and all the energy,
and all the dark energy, and all the rest of stuff
is to create what's in this room.
Maybe not.
That would be a mildly arrogant viewpoint.
(Laughter)
So, if that's not the purpose of the universe, then what's next?
I think we're going to move from a Homo sapiens into a Homo evolutis.
And I think this isn't 1,000 years out.
I think most of us are going to glance at it,
and our grandchildren are going to begin to live it.
And a Homo evolutis brings together these three trends
into a hominid that takes direct and deliberate control
over the evolution of his species, her species and other species.
And that, of course, would be the ultimate reboot.
(Applause)
In his inaugural address,
Barack Obama appealed to each of us to give our best
as we try to extricate ourselves from this current financial crisis.
But what did he appeal to?
He did not, happily, follow in the footsteps of his predecessor,
and tell us to just go shopping.
Nor did he tell us, "Trust us. Trust your country.
Invest, invest, invest."
Instead, what he told us was to put aside childish things.
And he appealed to virtue.
Virtue is an old-fashioned word.
It seems a little out of place in a cutting-edge environment like this one.
And besides, some of you might be wondering,
what the hell does it mean?
This is the job description of a hospital janitor
that is scrolling up on the screen.
And all of the items on it are unremarkable.
They're the things you would expect:
mop the floors, sweep them, empty the trash, restock the cabinets.
It may be a little surprising how many things there are,
but it's not surprising what they are.
But the one thing I want you to notice about them is this:
even though this is a very long list,
there isn't a single thing on it that involves other human beings.
Not one.
The janitor's job could just as well be done in a mortuary as in a hospital.
to get a sense of what they thought their jobs were like,
they encountered Mike,
who told them about how he stopped mopping the floor
because Mr. Jones was out of his bed getting a little exercise,
trying to build up his strength, walking slowly up and down the hall.
And Charlene told them about how she ignored her supervisor's admonition
and didn't vacuum the visitor's lounge
because there were some family members who were there all day, every day
who, at this moment, happened to be taking a nap.
And then there was Luke,
who washed the floor in a comatose young man's room twice
because the man's father, who had been keeping a vigil for six months,
didn't see Luke do it the first time,
and his father was angry.
And behavior like this from janitors, from technicians, from nurses
and, if we're lucky now and then, from doctors,
doesn't just make people feel a little better,
it actually improves the quality of patient care
and enables hospitals to run well.
But the ones who are think that these sorts of human interactions
involving kindness, care and empathy
are an essential part of the job.
And yet their job description contains not one word about other human beings.
These janitors have the moral will to do right by other people.
And beyond this, they have the moral skill to figure out what "doing right" means.
"is the combination of moral will and moral skill."
A wise person knows when and how to make the exception to every rule,
as the janitors knew when to ignore the job duties in the service of other objectives.
A wise person knows how to improvise,
as Luke did when he re-washed the floor.
Real-world problems are often ambiguous and ill-defined
and the context is always changing.
A wise person is like a jazz musician --
using the notes on the page, but dancing around them,
inventing combinations that are appropriate for the situation and the people at hand.
A wise person knows how to use these moral skills
in the service of the right aims.
To serve other people, not to manipulate other people.
And finally, perhaps most important,
a wise person is made, not born.
Wisdom depends on experience,
and not just any experience.
You need the time to get to know the people that you're serving.
You need permission to be allowed to improvise,
try new things, occasionally to fail and to learn from your failures.
And you need to be mentored by wise teachers.
how hard it is to learn to do their job,
they tell you that it takes lots of experience.
And they don't mean it takes lots of experience to learn how to mop floors and empty trash cans.
It takes lots of experience to learn how to care for people.
At TED, brilliance is rampant.
It's scary.
The good news is you don't need to be brilliant to be wise.
The bad news is that without wisdom,
brilliance isn't enough.
It's as likely to get you and other people into trouble as anything else.
(Applause)
There's a sense in which it's obvious,
and yet, let me tell you a little story.
It's a story about lemonade.
A dad and his seven-year-old son were watching a Detroit Tigers game at the ballpark.
His son asked him for some lemonade
and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it.
All they had was Mike's Hard Lemonade,
which was five percent alcohol.
Dad, being an academic, had no idea that Mike's Hard Lemonade contained alcohol.
So he brought it back.
And the kid was drinking it, and a security guard spotted it,
and called the police, who called an ambulance
that rushed to the ballpark, whisked the kid to the hospital.
The emergency room ascertained that the kid had no alcohol in his blood.
And they were ready to let the kid go.
The Wayne County Child Welfare Protection Agency said no.
And the child was sent to a foster home for three days.
At that point, can the child go home?
Well, a judge said yes, but only if the dad leaves the house and checks into a motel.
After two weeks, I'm happy to report,
the family was reunited.
But the welfare workers and the ambulance people
and the judge all said the same thing:
"We hate to do it but we have to follow procedure."
Scott Simon, who told this story on NPR,
said, "Rules and procedures may be dumb,
but they spare you from thinking."
And, to be fair, rules are often imposed
because previous officials have been lax
and they let a child go back to an abusive household.
Fair enough.
When things go wrong, as of course they do,
we reach for two tools to try to fix them.
Better ones, more of them.
The second tool we reach for is incentives.
Better ones, more of them.
What else, after all, is there?
We can certainly see this in response to the current financial crisis.
Regulate, regulate, regulate.
Fix the incentives, fix the incentives, fix the incentives ...
The truth is that neither rules nor incentives
are enough to do the job.
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did?
And would you pay them a bonus for being empathic?
It's preposterous on its face.
And what happens is that as we turn increasingly to rules,
rules and incentives may make things better in the short run,
but they create a downward spiral
that makes them worse in the long run.
Moral skill is chipped away by an over-reliance on rules
that deprives us of the opportunity
to improvise and learn from our improvisations.
And moral will is undermined
by an incessant appeal to incentives
that destroy our desire to do the right thing.
And without intending it,
by appealing to rules and incentives,
we are engaging in a war on wisdom.
first of rules and the war on moral skill.
The lemonade story is one.
Second, no doubt more familiar to you,
is the nature of modern American education:
scripted, lock-step curricula.
Here's an example from Chicago kindergarten.
Reading and enjoying literature
and words that begin with 'B.'
"The Bath:" Assemble students on a rug
and give students a warning about the dangers of hot water.
Say 75 items in this script to teach a 25-page picture book.
All over Chicago in every kindergarten class in the city,
every teacher is saying the same words in the same way on the same day.
We know why these scripts are there.
We don't trust the judgment of teachers enough
to let them loose on their own.
Scripts like these are insurance policies against disaster.
And they prevent disaster.
But what they assure in its place is mediocrity.
(Applause)
Jazz musicians need some notes --
most of them need some notes on the page.
We need more rules for the bankers, God knows.
But too many rules prevent accomplished jazz musicians
from improvising.
And as a result, they lose their gifts,
or worse, they stop playing altogether.
They seem cleverer.
If you have one reason for doing something
and I give you a second reason for doing the same thing,
it seems only logical that two reasons are better than one
and you're more likely to do it.
Right?
Well, not always.
Sometimes two reasons to do the same thing seem to compete with one another
instead of complimenting,
and they make people less likely to do it.
In Switzerland, back about 15 years ago,
they were trying to decide where to site nuclear waste dumps.
There was going to be a national referendum.
Some psychologists went around and polled citizens who were very well informed.
And they said, "Would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
Astonishingly, 50 percent of the citizens said yes.
They knew it was dangerous.
They thought it would reduce their property values.
But it had to go somewhere
and they had responsibilities as citizens.
The psychologists asked other people a slightly different question.
They said, "If we paid you six weeks' salary every year
would you be willing to have a nuclear waste dump in your community?"
Two reasons. It's my responsibility and I'm getting paid.
Instead of 50 percent saying yes,
25 percent said yes.
What happens is that
the second this introduction of incentive gets us
so that instead of asking, "What is my responsibility?"
all we ask is, "What serves my interests?"
When incentives don't work,
when CEOs ignore the long-term health of their companies
in pursuit of short-term gains that will lead to massive bonuses,
the response is always the same.
Get smarter incentives.
that are ever going to be smart enough.
Any incentive system can be subverted by bad will.
We need incentives. People have to make a living.
But excessive reliance on incentives
demoralizes professional activity
in two senses of that word.
It causes people who engage in that activity to lose morale
and it causes the activity itself to lose morality.
"We must ask not just 'Is it profitable?' but 'Is it right?'"
And when professions are demoralized,
everyone in them becomes dependent on -- addicted to -- incentives
and they stop asking "Is it right?"
We see this in medicine.
("Although it's nothing serious, let's keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't turn into a major lawsuit.")
And we certainly see it in the world of business.
("In order to remain competitive in today's marketplace, I'm afraid we're going to have to replace you with a sleezeball.")
("I sold my soul for about a tenth of what the damn things are going for now.")
It is obvious that this is not the way people want to do their work.
A few sources of hope:
we ought to try to re-moralize work.
One way not to do it: teach more ethics courses.
(Applause)
There is no better way to show people that you're not serious
than to tie up everything you have to say about ethics
into a little package with a bow and consign it to the margins as an ethics course.
One: Celebrate moral exemplars.
Acknowledge, when you go to law school,
that a little voice is whispering in your ear
about Atticus Finch.
No 10-year-old goes to law school to do mergers and acquisitions.
People are inspired by moral heroes.
But we learn that with sophistication
comes the understanding that you can't acknowledge that you have moral heroes.
Well, acknowledge them.
Be proud that you have them.
Celebrate them.
And demand that the people who teach you acknowledge them and celebrate them too.
That's one thing we can do.
another moral hero, 15 years ago, Aaron Feuerstein,
who was the head of Malden Mills in Massachusetts --
they made Polartec --
The factory burned down.
3,000 employees. He kept every one of them on the payroll.
Why? Because it would have been a disaster for them
and for the community if he had let them go.
"Maybe on paper our company is worth less to Wall Street,
but I can tell you it's worth more. We're doing fine."
Two were particularly inspiring to me.
One was Ray Anderson, who turned --
(Applause)
-- turned, you know, a part of the evil empire
into a zero-footprint, or almost zero-footprint business.
Why? Because it was the right thing to do.
And a bonus he's discovering is
he's actually going to make even more money.
His employees are inspired by the effort.
Why? Because there happy to be doing something that's the right thing to do.
Yesterday we heard Willie Smits talk about re-foresting in Indonesia.
(Applause)
Because it took the will to do the right thing.
God knows it took a huge amount of technical skill.
I'm boggled at how much he and his associates needed to know
in order to plot this out.
But most important to make it work --
and he emphasized this --
is that it took knowing the people in the communities.
Unless the people you're working with are behind you,
this will fail.
And there isn't a formula to tell you how to get the people behind you,
because different people in different communities
organize their lives in different ways.
And you don't have to be a mega-hero.
There are ordinary heroes.
Ordinary heroes like the janitors who are worth celebrating too.
As practitioners each and every one of us should strive
to be ordinary, if not extraordinary heroes.
As heads of organizations,
we should strive to create environments
that encourage and nurture both moral skill and moral will.
Even the wisest and most well-meaning people
will give up if they have to swim against the current
in the organizations in which they work.
that none of the jobs -- none of the jobs --
have job descriptions like the job descriptions of the janitors.
Because the truth is that
any work that you do that involves interaction with other people
is moral work.
And any moral work depends upon practical wisdom.
as teachers, we should strive to be the ordinary heroes,
the moral exemplars, to the people we mentor.
And there are a few things that we have to remember as teachers.
One is that we are always teaching.
Someone is always watching.
The camera is always on.
Bill Gates talked about the importance of education
and, in particular, the model that KIPP was providing:
"Knowledge is power."
And he talked about a lot of the wonderful things
that KIPP is doing
to take inner-city kids and turn them in the direction of college.
that Bill didn't mention.
That is that they have come to the realization
that the single most important thing kids need to learn
is character.
They need to learn to respect themselves.
They need to learn to respect their schoolmates.
They need to learn to respect their teachers.
And, most important, they need to learn to respect learning.
That's the principle objective.
If you do that, the rest is just pretty much a coast downhill.
And the teachers: the way you teach these things to the kids
is by having the teachers and all the other staff embody it every minute of every day.
And I think he was right.
And the virtue I think we need above all others is practical wisdom,
because it's what allows other virtues -- honesty, kindness, courage and so on --
to be displayed at the right time and in the right way.
He also appealed to hope.
Right again.
I think there is reason for hope.
I think people want to be allowed to be virtuous.
Wanting to do the right thing
in the right way
for the right reasons.
This kind of wisdom is within the grasp of each and every one of us
if only we start paying attention.
Paying attention to what we do,
to how we do it,
and, perhaps most importantly,
to the structure of the organizations within which we work,
so as to make sure that it enables us and other people to develop wisdom
rather than having it suppressed.
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,
playing with blocks.
As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,
pick them up and move them around,
you were actually learning how to think and solve problems
by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.
Spatial reasoning is deeply connected
to how we understand a lot of the world around us.
inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --
along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --
I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,
instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip
moving around a flat desktop,
what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,
arranging it the way we wanted?
This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,
by building Siftables.
the size of a cookie.
They're able to be moved around by hand,
they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,
and they have a screen and a wireless radio.
Most importantly, they're physical,
so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.
And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem
of tools for manipulating digital information.
And as these tools become more physical,
more aware of their motion, aware of each other,
and aware of the nuance of how we move them,
we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.
So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.
and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;
if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.
And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.
So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.
If they get surrounded, they notice that too,
they might get a little flustered.
And they can also sense their motion and tilt.
was that we could use everyday gestures on data,
like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.
So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets
and I can use them to pour color into that central one,
where they get mixed.
If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.
like language, math and logic games
where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,
and view the results immediately.
So here I'm --
(Applause)
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.
Basically, in every round
you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,
and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.
Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,
and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.
Thank you.
(Applause)
and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.
They really loved it.
And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application
is that you don't have to give people many instructions.
All you have to say is, "Make words,"
and they know exactly what to do.
That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.
Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.
So to him, they were just blocks.
Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.
And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.
And this is Felix, actually.
And he can bring new characters into the scene,
just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.
Here, he's bringing the sun out.
Good job! Yeah!
he can make the characters interact --
and he gets to decide how it unfolds.
is a music sequencing and live performance tool
that we've built recently,
in which Siftables act as sounds
like lead, bass and drums.
Each of these has four different variations,
you get to choose which one you want to use.
And you can inject these sounds into a sequence
that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.
And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.
There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.
You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.
And then, overall effects like tempo and volume
that apply to the entire sequence.
So let's have a look.
into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,
extend it, add a little more lead.
Now I put a bass line in.
DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.
Video: (Music)
by tilting the tempo one way or the other.
So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,
making it longer or shorter as I go.
And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out
using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.
Thank you.
my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces
that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.
And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,
and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.
So the thought I want to leave you with
is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools
for interacting with digital media
that are going to bring information into our world
on our terms.
Thank you very much.
I look forward to talking with all of you.
I am a writer.
Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.
It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.
And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.
But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently
in my life and in my career,
which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.
And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,
this memoir called "Eat, Pray, Love"
which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,
went out in the world for some reason, and became this big,
mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.
The result of which is that everywhere I go now,
people treat me like I'm doomed.
Seriously -- doomed, doomed!
Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,
"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?
Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life
and you're never again going to create a book
that anybody in the world cares about at all,
ever again?"
But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember
Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.
And I always have been.
And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides
that people can't even guess at,
like seaweed and other things that are scary.
But, when it comes to writing,
the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately,
is why?
to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.
And what is it specifically about creative ventures
that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health
in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?
Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer
and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering
anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?
"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?"
It just didn't come up like that, you know?
But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group
haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries
for being alcoholic manic-depressives.
and not just writers, but creative people across all genres,
it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.
And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count
in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds
who died young and often at their own hands, you know?
And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide
seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.
Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,
"Every one of my books has killed me a little more."
An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.
But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,
because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long
and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively
this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked
and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.
Are you comfortable with that?
Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --
I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.
I think it's odious.
And I also think it's dangerous,
and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.
I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.
it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path
Which is -- you know, like check it out,
And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward
is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after
the freakish success of my last book, right?
I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --
it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.
So Jesus, what a thought!
That's the kind of thought that could lead a person
to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,
and I don't want to go there.
And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,
that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,
is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?
I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance
between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety
about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.
I've been sort of looking across time,
and I've been trying to find other societies
to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have
people did not happen to believe that creativity
came from human beings back then, OK?
People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit
that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,
for distant and unknowable reasons.
The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity "daemons."
Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon
who spoke wisdom to him from afar.
but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.
Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think
that a genius was a particularly clever individual.
They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,
and would shape the outcome of that work.
that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.
And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?
So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,
like, for example, too much narcissism, right?
If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,
everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you.
If your work bombed, not entirely your fault, you know?
Everyone knew your genius was kind of lame.
above all gods and mysteries,
And for the first time in history,
you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius,
rather than having a genius.
You know, I think that allowing somebody, one mere person
to believe that he or she is like, the vessel,
you know, like the font and the essence and the source
of all divine, creative, unknowable, eternal mystery
is just a smidge too much responsibility to put on one fragile, human psyche.
It's like asking somebody to swallow the sun.
It just completely warps and distorts egos,
and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance.
And I think the pressure of that
has been killing off our artists for the last 500 years.
and I think it is true,
the question becomes, what now?
Can we do this differently?
Maybe go back to some more ancient understanding
about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery.
Maybe not.
Maybe we can't just erase 500 years of rational humanistic thought
in one 18 minute speech.
And there's probably people in this audience
who would raise really legitimate scientific suspicions
about the notion of, basically, fairies
who follow people around rubbing fairy juice on their projects and stuff.
I'm not, probably, going to bring you all along with me on this.
you know, why not?
Why not think about it this way?
Because it makes as much sense as anything else I have ever heard
in terms of explaining the utter maddening capriciousness
of the creative process.
A process which, as anybody who has ever tried to make something --
which is to say basically everyone here ---
knows does not always behave rationally.
And, in fact, can sometimes feel downright paranormal.
who's now in her 90s, but she's been a poet her entire life
and she told me that when she was growing up in rural Virginia,
she would be out working in the fields,
and she said she would feel and hear a poem
coming at her from over the landscape.
And she said it was like a thunderous train of air.
And it would come barreling down at her over the landscape.
and grab it on the page.
she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it, right?
She would catch the poem by its tail,
and she would pull it backwards into her body
as she was transcribing on the page.
And in these instances, the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact
but backwards, from the last word to the first.
that's exactly what my creative process is like.
even I have brushed up against that thing, at times.
that I honestly cannot identify.
And what is that thing?
And how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds,
but, in fact, might actually keep us sane?
is the musician Tom Waits,
who I got to interview several years ago on a magazine assignment.
And we were talking about this,
and you know, Tom, for most of his life, he was pretty much the embodiment
of the tormented contemporary modern artist,
trying to control and manage and dominate
these sort of uncontrollable creative impulses
that were totally internalized.
and one day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,
and this is when it all changed for him.
that comes into his head as inspiration often comes, elusive and tantalizing,
and he wants it, it's gorgeous,
like, "I'm going to lose this thing,
and I'll be be haunted by this song forever.
He just looked up at the sky, and he said,
"Excuse me, can you not see that I'm driving?"
If you really want to exist, come back at a more opportune moment
when I can take care of you.
Otherwise, go bother somebody else today.
Go bother Leonard Cohen."
Not the work, the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever.
But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it
was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him
where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,
kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing
the way that I worked too, and this idea already saved me once.
It saved me when I was in the middle of writing "Eat, Pray, Love,"
and I fell into one of those sort of pits of despair
that we all fall into when we're working on something and it's not coming
But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air
and I tried it.
So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript
and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.
And I said aloud, "Listen you, thing,
you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant
that is not entirely my fault, right?
Because you can see that I am putting everything I have into this,
I don't have any more than this.
centuries ago in the deserts of North Africa,
people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music
that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.
and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.
And I know you know what I'm talking about,
It was like time would stop,
and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal
but everything would align.
And all of a sudden, he would no longer appear to be merely human.
He would be lit from within, and lit from below
and all lit up on fire with divinity.
people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.
That's God, you know.
Curious historical footnote:
when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them
and the pronunciation changed over the centuries
from "Allah, Allah, Allah," to "Olé, olé, olé,"
which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.
In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,
"Allah, olé, olé, Allah, magnificent, bravo,"
He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,
and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.
And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,
and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?
This is hard.
This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make
in a creative life.
But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish
if you never happened to believe, in the first place,
that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.
But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you
from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life
And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.
and this is certainly how I've been thinking in the last few months
as I've been working on the book that will soon be published,
as the dangerously, frighteningly over-anticipated follow up
to my freakish success.
If the divine, cockeyed genius assigned to your case
decides to let some sort of wonderment be glimpsed, for just one moment
And "Olé!" to you, nonetheless.
I believe this and I feel that we must teach it.
"Olé!" to you, nonetheless,
just for having the sheer human love and stubbornness
to keep showing up.
I became an inventor by accident.
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:
I went in in 1956, came out in 1959,
was working at the University of Washington,
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,
for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --
any of the cool stuff we've got now.
And it was an arm that,
instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,
went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,
and I got really lucky after that.
I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:
my 44th invention. No, that's not true either.
Golly, I'm just totally losing it.
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.
I call this hypersonic sound.
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,
but I want to make an analogy before I do
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,
That's really cool, but what's it good for?
And I say, What is the light bulb good for?
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.
Hasn't changed that much.
Light came out of it in every direction.
Before the light bulb was invented,
people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,
focus it a little bit;
put lenses in front of it,
focus it a little bit better.
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers
that were totally focused.
if we had the light bulb,
but you couldn't focus light;
if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.
You turn on the loudspeaker,
and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,
the sound just kind of goes where it wants.
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,
it's pretty much every direction.
A little bit of differential, but not much.
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,
and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,
we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,
or computers, or T.V. sets,
or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list
of what the importance is
of being able to focus light.
I thought it was about time that we figure out
a way to put sound where you want to.
I have a couple of units.
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day
for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --
small version, over your head --
so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.
(Applause)
The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?
(Applause)
Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,
and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.
to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,
or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.
They tried this back in the '60s
and were too smart, and so they gave up.
But they want to use it -- seriously.
There's a mix an inventor has to have.
You have to be kind of smart,
and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,
because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.
Too many other smart people out there. So.
I just happened to get my education in a little different way.
I'm not at all against education.
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,
when they get educated, lose it:
they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.
And we're living in a great time right now,
because almost everything's being explored anew.
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:
virtually nothing --
and I mean this honestly --
has been invented yet.
We're just starting.
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.
that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,
you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.
They know that when you watch T.V. at home,
because there are so many choices
you can change channels, miss their commercials.
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,
because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message
every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,
you get to watch it for free;
when you want to hear the sound, you pay.
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing
where when you step in the line in the supermarket --
initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;
they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --
you'll be watching TV.
that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,
if you don't want to hear it,
you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;
your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;
doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.
all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.
They have literally beat a path to our door.
We've been selling it since about last September, October,
and it's been immensely gratifying.
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --
if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.
We expect by this time next year,
it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --
that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.
And the sound that you're hearing,
unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,
is made out in front of it, in the air.
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.
You turn up the volume just a little bit --
I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --
and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.
I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,
I'm having an effect on the pressure,
which means during the making of that sine wave,
the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.
is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.
Linearity means higher quality sound.
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:
it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --
the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,
but it's so predictable
that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.
Instead of being made on the face of the cone,
it's made at literally billions of little independent points
along this narrow column in the air,
and so when I aim it towards you,
what you hear is made right next to your ears.
I said we can shorten the column,
we can spread it out to cover the couch.
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,
the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.
When you listen to stereo on your home system,
your both ears hear both speakers.
Turn on the left speaker sometime
and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.
the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.
Because the sound is made in the air along this column,
it does not follow the inverse square law,
which says it drops off about two thirds
every time you double the distance:
6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,
and the guy in the front row gets the same level
as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.
Isn't that terrific?
in having companies catch the vision of this,
from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,
and a separate system in the back --
oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.
(Laughter)
I was seeing if you were listening.
Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,
and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,
and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,
or their rap music or whatever.
So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to
is really starting to catch on.
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.
It also works five times better underwater.
where you can put fake troop movements
quarter of a mile away on a hillside.
(Laughter)
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.
(Laughter)
and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift
from 100 yards away when they play this thing.
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.
Pain is 120.
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,
and there can be a public beach just off to the side,
and they don't even know it's turned on.
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,
and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.
We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --
I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --
and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.
We're using very short wavelengths.
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.
When you run very short wavelengths,
like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,
and there's more energy coming out of the antenna
than there is the backscatter from the ground
that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."
I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?
Turn it on; turn it off.
That's a fluorescent tube refined."
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,
when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,
and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.
(Laughter)
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer
in my attic at my house,
and one of the many designs which they have now
is still the same design I drew way back when.
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.
one more quick demo of this guy,
for those of you that haven't heard it.
Can never tell if it's on.
If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.
Getting it over there?
Get the cameraman.
Yeah, there you go.
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.
Thank you once again.
Appreciate it very much.
You know, I am so bad at tech
that my daughter -- who is now 41 --
when she was five, was overheard by me
to say to a friend of hers,
If it doesn't bleed when you cut it,
my daddy doesn't understand it.
(Laughter)
So, the assignment I've been given
may be an insuperable obstacle for me,
but I'm certainly going to try.
during these last four days?
This is my third visit to TED.
One was to TEDMED, and one, as you've heard,
was a regular TED two years ago.
I've heard what I consider an extraordinary thing
that I've only heard a little bit in the two previous TEDs,
and what that is is an interweaving
and an interlarding, an intermixing,
of a sense of social responsibility
in so many of the talks --
global responsibility, in fact,
appealing to enlightened self-interest,
but it goes far beyond enlightened self-interest.
One of the most impressive things
about what some, perhaps 10,
of the speakers have been talking about
is the realization, as you listen to them carefully, that they're not saying:
Well, this is what we should do; this is what I would like you to do.
It's: This is what I have done
because I'm excited by it,
because it's a wonderful thing, and it's done something for me
and, of course, it's accomplished a great deal.
It's the old concept, the real Greek concept,
of philanthropy in its original sense:
phil-anthropy, the love of humankind.
for some of what you've been hearing in the last four days
is that it arises, in fact, out of a form of love.
And this gives me enormous hope.
And hope, of course, is the topic
that I'm supposed to be speaking about,
which I'd completely forgotten about until I arrived.
And when I did, I thought,
well, I'd better look this word up in the dictionary.
So, Sarah and I -- my wife -- walked over to the public library,
which is four blocks away, on Pacific Street, and we got the OED,
and we looked in there, and there are 14 definitions of hope,
none of which really hits you
between the eyes as being the appropriate one.
And, of course, that makes sense,
because hope is an abstract phenomenon; it's an abstract idea,
it's not a concrete word.
If there's one operation for a disease, you know it works.
If there are 15 operations, you know that none of them work.
And that's the way it is with definitions of words.
If you have appendicitis, they take your appendix out, and you're cured.
If you've got reflux oesophagitis, there are 15 procedures,
and Joe Schmo does it one way
and Will Blow does it another way,
and none of them work, and that's the way it is with this word, hope.
They all come down to the idea of an expectation
of something good that is due to happen.
And you know what I found out?
The Indo-European root of the word hope
is a stem, K-E-U --
we would spell it K-E-U; it's pronounced koy --
and it is the same root from which the word curve comes from.
But what it means in the original Indo-European
is a change in direction, going in a different way.
because what you've been hearing in the last couple of days
is the sense of going in different directions:
directions that are specific and unique to problems.
There are different paradigms.
You've heard that word several times in the last four days,
and everyone's familiar with Kuhnian paradigms.
So, when we think of hope now,
we have to think of looking in other directions
than we have been looking.
There's another -- not definition, but description, of hope
that has always appealed to me, and it was one by Václav Havel
in his perfectly spectacular book "Breaking the Peace,"
in which he says that hope
does not consist of the expectation that things will
come out exactly right,
but the expectation that they will make sense
regardless of how they come out.
by the very last sentence
in that glorious presentation by Dean Kamen a few days ago.
I wasn't sure I heard it right,
so I found him in one of the inter-sessions.
He was talking to a very large man, but I didn't care.
I interrupted, and I said, "Did you say this?"
He said, "I think so."
So, here's what it is: I'll repeat it.
"The world will not be saved by the Internet."
It's wonderful. Do you know what the world will be saved by?
I'll tell you. It'll be saved by the human spirit.
And by the human spirit, I don't mean anything divine,
I don't mean anything supernatural --
certainly not coming from this skeptic.
What I mean is this ability
that each of us has
to be something greater than herself or himself;
to arise out of our ordinary selves and achieve something
that at the beginning we thought perhaps we were not capable of.
On an elemental level, we have all felt
that spirituality at the time of childbirth.
Some of you have felt it in laboratories;
some of you have felt it at the workbench.
We feel it at concerts.
I've felt it in the operating room, at the bedside.
It is an elevation of us beyond ourselves.
And I think that it's going to be, in time,
the elements of the human spirit that we've been hearing about
bit by bit by bit from so many of the speakers in the last few days.
And if there's anything that has permeated this room,
it is precisely that.
a concept that was brought to life
in the early part of the 19th century --
actually, in the second decade of the 19th century --
by a 27-year-old poet
whose name was Percy Shelley.
Now, we all think that Shelley
obviously is the great romantic poet that he was;
many of us tend to forget that he wrote
some perfectly wonderful essays, too,
and the most well-remembered essay
is one called "A Defence of Poetry."
Now, it's about five, six, seven, eight pages long,
and it gets kind of deep and difficult after about the third page,
but somewhere on the second page
he begins talking about the notion
that he calls "moral imagination."
And here's what he says, roughly translated:
A man -- generic man --
a man, to be greatly good,
must imagine clearly.
He must see himself and the world
through the eyes of another,
and of many others.
See himself and the world -- not just the world, but see himself.
by the billions of people
who live in what Laurie Garrett the other day
so appropriately called
despair and disparity?
What is it that they have every right
to ask of us?
What is it that we have every right to ask of ourselves,
out of our shared humanity and out of the human spirit?
Well, you know precisely what it is.
There's a great deal of argument
about whether we, as the great nation that we are,
should be the policeman of the world,
the world's constabulary,
but there should be virtually no argument
about whether we should be the world's healer.
There has certainly been no argument about that
in this room in the past four days.
every disadvantaged person in this world --
including in the United States -- becomes our patient.
Every disadvantaged nation, and perhaps our own nation,
becomes our patient.
So, it's fun to think about the etymology of the word "patient."
It comes initially from the Latin patior, to endure, or to suffer.
So, you go back to the old Indo-European root again,
and what do you find? The Indo-European stem is pronounced payen --
we would spell it P-A-E-N -- and, lo and behold, mirabile dictu,
it is the same root as the word compassion comes from, P-A-E-N.
the world, and the disadvantaged of the world --
that patient deserves our compassion.
But beyond our compassion, and far greater than compassion,
is our moral imagination
and our identification with each individual
who lives in that world,
not to think of them as a huge forest,
but as individual trees.
Of course, in this day and age, the trick is not to let each tree
be obscured by that Bush in Washington that can get --
can get in the way.
(Laughter)
So, here we are.
We are, should be,
morally committed to
being the healer of the world.
And we have had examples over and over and over again --
you've just heard one in the last 15 minutes --
of people who have not only had that commitment,
but had the charisma, the brilliance --
and I think in this room it's easy to use the word brilliant, my God --
the brilliance to succeed at least at the beginning
of their quest,
and who no doubt will continue to succeed,
as long as more and more of us enlist ourselves in their cause.
about medicine,
and we're talking about healing,
I'd like to quote someone who hasn't been quoted.
It seems to me everybody in the world's been quoted here:
Pogo's been quoted;
Shakespeare's been quoted backwards, forwards, inside out.
I would like to quote one of my own household gods.
I suspect he never really said this,
because we don't know what Hippocrates really said,
but we do know for sure that one of the great Greek physicians
said the following,
and it has been recorded in one of the books attributed to Hippocrates,
and the book is called "Precepts."
And I'll read you what it is.
Remember, I have been talking about,
essentially philanthropy:
the love of humankind, the individual humankind
and the individual humankind
that can bring that kind of love
translated into action,
translated, in some cases, into enlightened self-interest.
And here he is, 2,400 years ago:
"Where there is love of humankind,
there is love of healing."
We have seen that here today
with the sense,
with the sensitivity --
and in the last three days,
and with the power of the indomitable human spirit.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So, I want to start out with
this beautiful picture from my childhood.
I love the science fiction movies.
Here it is: "This Island Earth."
And leave it to Hollywood to get it just right.
Two-and-a-half years in the making.
(Laughter)
I mean, even the creationists give us 6,000,
but Hollywood goes to the chase.
And in this movie, we see what we think is out there:
flying saucers and aliens.
Every world has an alien, and every alien world has a flying saucer,
and they move about with great speed. Aliens.
where we got tired of turning on the TV
and seeing the spaceships and seeing the aliens every night,
and tried to write a counter-argument to it,
and put out what does it really take for an Earth to be habitable,
for a planet to be an Earth, to have a place
where you could probably get not just life, but complexity,
which requires a huge amount of evolution,
and therefore constancy of conditions.
So, in 2000 we wrote "Rare Earth." In 2003, we then asked,
let's not think about where Earths are in space, but how long has Earth been Earth?
If you go back two billion years,
you're not on an Earth-like planet any more.
What we call an Earth-like planet is actually a very short interval of time.
taught me an awful lot about meeting the public.
Right after, I got an invitation to go to a science fiction convention,
and with all great earnestness walked in.
David Brin was going to debate me on this,
and as I walked in, the crowd of a hundred started booing lustily.
I had a girl who came up who said, "My dad says you're the devil."
You cannot take people's aliens away from them
and expect to be anybody's friends.
Well, the second part of that, soon after --
and I was talking to Paul Allen; I saw him in the audience,
and I handed him a copy of "Rare Earth."
And Jill Tarter was there, and she turned to me,
and she looked at me just like that girl in "The Exorcist."
It was, "It burns! It burns!"
Because SETI doesn't want to hear this.
SETI wants there to be stuff out there.
I really applaud the SETI efforts, but we have not heard anything yet.
And I really do think we have to start thinking
about what's a good planet and what isn't.
even if SETI does hear something, can we figure out what they said?
Because this was a slide that was passed
between the two major intelligences on Earth -- a Mac to a PC --
and it can't even get the letters right --
(Laughter)
-- so how are we going to talk to the aliens?
And if they're 50 light years away, and we call them up,
and you blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
and then 50 years later it comes back and they say, Please repeat?
I mean, there we are.
Mars is a bad planet, but it's still good enough for us to go there
and to live on its surface if we're protected.
But Venus is a very bad -- the worst -- planet.
Even though it's Earth-like, and even though early in its history
it may very well have harbored Earth-like life,
it soon succumbed to runaway greenhouse --
that's an 800 degrees [Fahrenheit] surface --
because of rampant carbon dioxide.
what's going to happen to our particular planet.
We are right now in the beautiful Oreo
of existence -- of at least life on Planet Earth --
following the first horrible microbial age.
In the Cambrian explosion, life emerged from the swamps,
complexity arose,
and from what we can tell, we're halfway through.
We have as much time for animals to exist on this planet
as they have been here now,
till we hit the second microbial age.
And that will happen, paradoxically --
everything you hear about global warming --
when we hit CO2 down to 10 parts per million,
we are no longer going to have to have plants
that are allowed to have any photosynthesis, and there go animals.
So, after that we probably have seven billion years.
The Sun increases in its intensity, in its brightness,
and finally, at about 12 billion years after it first started,
the Earth is consumed by a large Sun,
and this is what's left.
So, a planet like us is going to have an age and an old age,
and we are in its golden summer age right now.
Now, a lot of you are going to die of old age,
but some of you, horribly enough, are going to die in an accident.
And that's the fate of a planet, too.
Earth, if we're lucky enough -- if it doesn't get hit by a Hale-Bopp,
or gets blasted by some supernova nearby
in the next seven billion years -- we'll find under your feet.
But what about accidental death?
Well, paleontologists for the last 200 years
have been charting death. It's strange --
extinction as a concept wasn't even thought about
until Baron Cuvier in France found this first mastodon.
He couldn't match it up to any bones on the planet,
and he said, Aha! It's extinct.
And very soon after, the fossil record started yielding
a very good idea of how many plants and animals there have been
since complex life really began to leave
a very interesting fossil record.
In that complex record of fossils,
there were times when lots of stuff
seemed to be dying out very quickly,
and the father/mother geologists
called these "mass extinctions."
or perhaps long, slow climate change,
and that really changed in 1980,
in this rocky outcrop near Gubbio,
where Walter Alvarez, trying to figure out
what was the time difference between these white rocks,
which held creatures of the Cretaceous period,
and the pink rocks above, which held Tertiary fossils.
How long did it take to go from one system to the next?
And what they found was something unexpected.
They found in this gap, in between, a very thin clay layer,
and that clay layer -- this very thin red layer here --
is filled with iridium.
And not just iridium; it's filled with glassy spherules,
and it's filled with quartz grains
that have been subjected to enormous pressure: shock quartz.
and this chalk was deposited in a warm ocean.
The chalk itself's composed by plankton
which has fallen down from the sea surface onto the sea floor,
so that 90 percent of the sediment here is skeleton of living stuff,
and then you have that millimeter-thick red layer,
and then you have black rock.
And the black rock is the sediment on the sea bottom
in the absence of plankton.
And that's what happens in an asteroid catastrophe,
because that's what this was, of course. This is the famous K-T.
A 10-kilometer body hit the planet.
The effects of it spread this very thin impact layer all over the planet,
and we had very quickly the death of the dinosaurs,
the death of these beautiful ammonites,
Leconteiceras here, and Celaeceras over here,
and so much else.
because we've had two Hollywood blockbusters since that time,
and this paradigm, from 1980 to about 2000,
totally changed how we geologists thought about catastrophes.
Prior to that, uniformitarianism was the dominant paradigm:
the fact that if anything happens on the planet in the past,
there are present-day processes that will explain it.
But we haven't witnessed a big asteroid impact,
so this is a type of neo-catastrophism,
and it took about 20 years for the scientific establishment
to finally come to grips: yes, we were hit;
and yes, the effects of that hit caused a major mass extinction.
over the last 500 million years, called the Big Five.
They range from 450 million years ago
to the last, the K-T, number four,
but the biggest of all was the P, or the Permian extinction,
sometimes called the mother of all mass extinctions.
And every one of these has been subsequently blamed
on large-body impact.
But is this true?
because of this beautiful structure on the right.
This is a Buckminsterfullerene, a carbon-60.
Because it looks like those terrible geodesic domes
of my late beloved '60s,
they're called "buckyballs."
This evidence was used to suggest
that at the end of the Permian, 250 million years ago, a comet hit us.
And when the comet hits, the pressure produces the buckyballs,
and it captures bits of the comet.
Helium-3: very rare on the surface of the Earth, very common in space.
In 1990, working on the K-T extinction for 10 years,
I moved to South Africa to begin work twice a year
in the great Karoo desert.
I was so lucky to watch the change of that South Africa
into the new South Africa as I went year by year.
And I worked on this Permian extinction,
camping by this Boer graveyard for months at a time.
And the fossils are extraordinary.
You know, you're gazing upon your very distant ancestors.
These are mammal-like reptiles.
They are culturally invisible. We do not make movies about these.
This is a Gorgonopsian, or a Gorgon.
That's an 18-inch long skull of an animal
that was probably seven or eight feet, sprawled like a lizard,
probably had a head like a lion.
This is the top carnivore, the T-Rex of its time.
But there's lots of stuff.
This is my poor son, Patrick.
(Laughter)
This is called paleontological child abuse.
Hold still, you're the scale.
(Laughter)
Fifty-five species of mammal-like reptiles.
The age of mammals had well and truly started
250 million years ago ...
... and then a catastrophe happened.
And what happens next is the age of dinosaurs.
It was all a mistake; it should have never happened. But it did.
Now, luckily,
this Thrinaxodon, the size of a robin egg here:
this is a skull I've discovered just before taking this picture --
there's a pen for scale; it's really tiny --
this is in the Lower Triassic, after the mass extinction has finished.
You can see the eye socket and you can see the little teeth in the front.
If that does not survive, I'm not the thing giving this talk.
Something else is, because if that doesn't survive, we are not here;
there are no mammals. It's that close; one species ekes through.
Here's sort of the end of that 10 years of work.
The ranges of stuff -- the red line is the mass extinction.
But we've got survivors and things that get through,
and it turns out the things that get through preferentially are cold bloods.
Warm-blooded animals take a huge hit at this time.
The survivors that do get through
produce this world of crocodile-like creatures.
There's no dinosaurs yet; just this slow, saurian, scaly, nasty,
swampy place with a couple of tiny mammals hiding in the fringes.
And there they would hide for 160 million years,
until liberated by that K-T asteroid.
And the what, I think, is that we returned, over and over again,
to the Pre-Cambrian world, that first microbial age,
and the microbes are still out there.
They hate we animals.
They really want their world back.
And they've tried over and over and over again.
This suggests to me that life causing these mass extinctions
because it did is inherently anti-Gaian.
This whole Gaia idea, that life makes the world better for itself --
anybody been on a freeway on a Friday afternoon in Los Angeles
believing in the Gaia theory? No.
and that life does actually try to do itself in --
not consciously, but just because it does.
And here's the weapon, it seems, that it did so over the last 500 million years.
There are microbes which, through their metabolism,
produce hydrogen sulfide,
and they do so in large amounts.
Hydrogen sulfide is very fatal to we humans.
As small as 200 parts per million will kill you.
You only have to go to the Black Sea and a few other places -- some lakes --
and get down, and you'll find that the water itself turns purple.
It turns purple from the presence of numerous microbes
which have to have sunlight and have to have hydrogen sulfide,
and we can detect their presence today -- we can see them --
but we can also detect their presence in the past.
an enormous breakthrough in a brand-new field.
I am almost extinct --
I'm a paleontologist who collects fossils.
But the new wave of paleontologists -- my graduate students --
collect biomarkers.
They take the sediment itself, they extract the oil from it,
and from that they can produce compounds
which turn out to be very specific to particular microbial groups.
It's because lipids are so tough, they can get preserved in sediment
and last the hundreds of millions of years necessary,
and be extracted and tell us who was there.
at many of these mass extinction boundaries,
this is what we find: isorenieratene. It's very specific.
It can only occur if the surface of the ocean has no oxygen,
and is totally saturated with hydrogen sulfide --
enough, for instance, to come out of solution.
This led Lee Kump, and others from Penn State and my group,
to propose what I call the Kump Hypothesis:
many of the mass extinctions were caused by lowering oxygen,
by high CO2. And the worst effect of global warming, it turns out:
hydrogen sulfide being produced out of the oceans.
In this particular case, the source over and over has been flood basalts.
This is a view of the Earth now, if we extract a lot of it.
And each of these looks like a hydrogen bomb;
actually, the effects are even worse.
This is when deep-Earth material comes to the surface,
spreads out over the surface of the planet.
Well, it's not the lava that kills anything,
it's the carbon dioxide that comes out with it.
This isn't Volvos; this is volcanoes.
But carbon dioxide is carbon dioxide.
and what we try to do now is
track the amount of carbon dioxide in the entire rock record --
and we can do this from a variety of means --
and put all the red lines here,
when these -- what I call greenhouse mass extinctions -- took place.
And there's two things that are really evident here to me,
is that these extinctions take place when CO2 is going up.
But the second thing that's not shown on here:
the Earth has never had any ice on it
when we've had 1,000 parts per million CO2.
We are at 380 and climbing.
We should be up to a thousand in three centuries at the most,
but my friend David Battisti in Seattle says he thinks a 100 years.
So, there goes the ice caps,
and there comes 240 feet of sea level rise.
I live in a view house now;
I'm going to have waterfront.
And we think this is the reason that complexity took so long
to take place on planet Earth.
We had these hydrogen sulfide oceans for a very great long period.
They stop complex life from existing.
We know hydrogen sulfide is erupting presently a few places on the planet.
And I throw this slide in -- this is me, actually, two months ago --
and I throw this slide in because here is my favorite animal, chambered nautilus.
It's been on this planet since the animals first started -- 500 million years.
This is a tracking experiment, and any of you scuba divers,
if you want to get involved in one of the coolest projects ever,
this is off the Great Barrier Reef.
And as we speak now,
these nautilus are tracking out their behaviors to us.
we divers can run into trouble,
so I'm going to do a little thought experiment here.
This is a Great White Shark that ate some of my traps.
We pulled it up; up it comes. So, it's out there with me at night.
So, I'm swimming along, and it takes off my leg.
I'm 80 miles from shore, what's going to happen to me?
Well now, I die.
Five years from now, this is what I hope happens to me:
I'm taken back to the boat, I'm given a gas mask:
80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide.
I'm then thrown in an ice pond, I'm cooled 15 degrees lower
and I could be taken to a critical care hospital.
And the reason I could do that is because we mammals
have gone through a series of these hydrogen sulfide events,
and our bodies have adapted.
And we can now use this as what I think will be a major medical breakthrough.
Tried to figure out how to save Americans after battlefield injuries.
He bleeds out pigs.
He puts in 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide --
the same stuff that survived these past mass extinctions --
and he turns a mammal into a reptile.
"I believe we are seeing in this response the result of mammals and reptiles
having undergone a series of exposures to H2S."
I got this email from him two years ago;
he said, "I think I've got an answer to some of your questions."
So, he now has taken mice down
for as many as four hours, sometimes six hours,
and these are brand-new data he sent me on the way over here.
On the top, now, that is a temperature record of a mouse who has gone through --
the dotted line, the temperatures.
So, the temperature starts at 25 centigrade,
and down it goes, down it goes.
Six hours later, up goes the temperature.
Now, the same mouse is given 80 parts per million hydrogen sulfide
in this solid graph,
and look what happens to its temperature.
Its temperature drops.
It goes down to 15 degrees centigrade from 35,
and comes out of this perfectly fine.
Here's how we can bring people cold enough to last till we get critical care.
Now, you're all thinking, yeah, what about the brain tissue?
And so this is one of the great challenges that is going to happen.
You're in an accident. You've got two choices:
you're going to die, or you're going to take the hydrogen sulfide
and, say, 75 percent of you is saved, mentally.
What are you going to do?
Do we all have to have a little button saying, Let me die?
This is coming towards us,
and I think this is going to be a revolution.
We're going to save lives, but there's going to be a cost to it.
and, yes, we have to think about the long term,
because we will get hit again.
But there's a far worse danger confronting us.
We can easily go back to the hydrogen sulfide world.
Give us a few millennia --
and we humans should last those few millennia --
will it happen again? If we continue, it'll happen again.
How many of us flew here?
How many of us have gone through
our entire Kyoto quota
just for flying this year?
How many of you have exceeded it? Yeah, I've certainly exceeded it.
We have a huge problem facing us as a species.
We have to beat this.
I want to be able to go back to this reef. Thank you.
Am I understanding you right, that what you're saying here
is that we have in our own bodies
a biochemical response to hydrogen sulfide
that in your mind proves that there have been past mass extinctions
due to climate change?
This is what Roth has found out.
So, what we're looking at now: does it leave a signal?
Does it leave a signal in bone or in plant?
And we go back to the fossil record and we could try to detect
how many of these have happened in the past.
an incredible medical technique, but also a terrifying ...
How can we investigate
this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology
into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?
I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses
and the spectrum of viruses that are out there
into, let's say, a small chip.
how we would make a single diagnostic assay
to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --
well, there's some problems with this idea.
First of all, viruses are pretty complex,
but they're also evolving very fast.
This is a picornavirus.
Picornaviruses -- these are things that include
the common cold and polio, things like this.
You're looking at the outside shell of the virus,
and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus
that are evolving very, very fast,
and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,
usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,
because how can we detect things if they're always changing?
But evolution is a balance:
where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation --
things that almost never change.
and I'm going to show you data now.
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,
like the common cold, like polio and so on,
and I just broke them down into small segments.
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,
and just break it into small windows.
And I'm coloring these small windows blue
if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome
to that virus.
These sequences right up here --
which don't even code for protein, by the way --
are almost absolutely identical across all of these,
so I could use this sequence as a marker
to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,
without having to make something individual.
Now, over here there's great diversity:
that's where things are evolving fast.
Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.
acute bee paralysis virus --
probably a bad one to have if you're a bee ---
this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,
but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved
among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen
are in identical regions right up here.
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation
through evolution -- how these viruses evolved --
by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements
in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,
I've been messing around making DNA chips --
that is, printing DNA on glass.
And that's what you see here:
These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,
and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip
and use them as a detection reagent.
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard
and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,
and this is what you see:
you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.
So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass --
little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.
OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,
and I'm really big on disseminating technology.
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,
you can build one of these too,
and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,
with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.
You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.
Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.
(Laughter)
Every important machine's got to have a big red button.
But really, it's pretty robust.
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage
and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.
(Laughter)
we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.
I talked about that --
you know, that situation where you go into the clinic
and you don't get diagnosed?
Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses
on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure --
I mean, why not?
The first thing you do as a scientist is,
you make sure stuff works.
And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells
and infect them with various viruses,
and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,
the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells --
mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,
and so we can look at spots.
And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.
and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.
And each spot represents a different family of virus
or species of virus.
And so, that's a hard way to look at things,
so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,
grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.
What we did is, we took tissue culture cells
and infected them with adenovirus,
and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.
And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 --
that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.
And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere --
it's like boogeremia, basically.
(Laughter)
You can see that this barcode is the same family,
but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,
which gives you a very bad cold.
And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.
Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.
Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,
and you can see that these signatures are distinct.
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus
gives a nice signature down here.
And so it is not any one stripe or something
that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;
it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.
and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode --
but what about different rhinoviruses?
How do I know which rhinovirus I have?
There're 102 known variants of the common cold,
and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:
And so, here are four different rhinoviruses,
and you can see, even with your eye,
because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,
expressly to be able to tell them apart,
but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.
So, here are four rhinoviruses
we never knew anything about --
no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see
that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.
You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,
of fingerprints of essentially every virus.
But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?
You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.
What about real people?
You can't control real people, as you probably know.
You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,
and it's probably really complex, right?
It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,
and it certainly has host genetic material.
So how do we deal with this?
And how do we do the positive control here?
That's me, getting a nasal lavage.
And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.
And basically we experimentally inoculate people
with the common cold virus.
Or, even better, let's just take people
right out of the emergency room --
undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.
You have no idea what walks in through the door.
So, let's start off with the positive control first,
where we know the person was healthy.
They got a shot of virus up the nose,
let's see what happens.
They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses
even when you're walking around healthy.
It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,
and it's very similar to what we get in the lab
doing our tissue culture experiment.
(Laughter)
-- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.
We sequenced part of their viruses;
they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.
Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences
we're using on this array allow us to detect
even novel or uncharacterized viruses,
because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.
Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.
These different blocks represent
the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,
so you can kind of go down the blocks
and see where the signal is.
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.
(Laughter)
But by the time you get to block nine,
you see that respiratory syncytial virus.
Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,
the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.
So, that's great.
Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days --
repeat visits to the clinic.
This individual has parainfluenza-1,
and you can see that there's a little stripe over here
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.
Everything that we could get out of GenBank --
that is, the national repository of sequences.
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?
so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,
because we're never going to get samples of every virus --
it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,
and compare them to our observed result --
If, for example, you used a cell culture
that's chronically infected with papilloma,
And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures
are chronically infected with.
And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.
We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,
[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.
10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum --
she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.
She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics
and then sent her home.
She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,
and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.
They did a CT scan.
A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.
All this white stuff -- it's not good.
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;
there's likely to be infection.
OK. So, the patient was treated then
with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,
and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.
They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat
and they began to mechanically ventilate her.
She could no longer breathe for herself.
What to do next? Don't know.
Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,
Tamiflu.
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu,
but they switched to Tamiflu.
You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,
and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?
You're looking at her open lung biopsy.
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.
It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.
And so, what did they test her for?
They have their own tests, of course,
and so they tested her for over 70 different assays,
for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay
you can buy off the shelf:
SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.
Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.
There's just a little bit of it sequenced.
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.
No one would even consider it,
because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data --
no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.
Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes
that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow --
and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip
to find something new and open a new door.
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics
about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:
third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.
Lots of risk factors,
there are folks that are predisposed to it.
And the first gene that was mapped in association studies
for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.
What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.
So, we're sitting around and thinking,
"Why would men who have the mutation --
a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?
It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?"
And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.
And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,
and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.
And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is
that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,
and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time --
a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.
OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?
So, we clone the whole virus.
so we actually clone the whole thing.
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;
no one's ever seen it before.
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice,
And this is a little phylogenetic tree
to see how it's related to other viruses.
We've done it for many patients now,
and we can say that they're all independent infections.
They all have the same virus,
but they're different enough that there's reason to believe
that they've been independently acquired.
Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue
and use material to actually locate the virus,
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?
Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.
But now it's a door.
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus
and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.
That's where we're at.
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,
but that's what, you know, science is really good at.
This was all done by folks in the lab --
I cannot take credit for most of this.
This is a collaboration between myself and Don.
This is the guy who started the project in my lab,
and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
The future that we will create can be a future that we'll be proud of.
I think about this every day; it's quite literally my job.
and since then we and our growing global team of contributors
have documented the ever-expanding variety of solutions
replicable models, technological tools, emerging ideas --
all providing a path to a future
Our emphasis on solutions is quite intentional.
There are tons of places to go, online and off,
if what you want to find is the latest bit of news
We want to offer people an idea of what they can do about it.
We focus primarily on the planet's environment,
but we also address issues of global development,
international conflict, responsible use of emerging technologies,
even the rise of the so-called Second Superpower
and much, much more.
but that reflects both the range of challenges that need to be met
A quick sampling really can barely scratch the surface,
but to give you a sense of what we cover:
tools for rapid disaster relief,
such as this inflatable concrete shelter;
innovative uses of bioscience,
such as a flower that changes color in the presence of landmines;
ultra high-efficiency designs for homes and offices;
distributed power generation using solar power, wind power,
ocean power, other clean energy sources;
ultra, ultra high-efficiency vehicles of the future;
ultra high-efficiency vehicles you can get right now;
and better urban design,
so you don't need to drive as much in the first place;
bio-mimetic approaches to design that take advantage of
the efficiencies of natural models in both vehicles and buildings;
distributed computing projects
that will help us model the future of the climate.
Also, a number of the topics that we've been talking about this week
at TED are things that we've addressed in the past on Worldchanging:
cradle-to-cradle design, MIT's Fab Labs,
the One Laptop per Child project, even Gapminder.
hurtling all too quickly to my fortieth birthday,
I'm naturally inclined to pessimism. But working at Worldchanging
that successful responses to the world's problems
are nonetheless possible.
Moreover, I've come to realize that focusing only on negative outcomes
can really blind you to the very possibility of success.
As Norwegian social scientist Evelin Lindner has observed,
"Pessimism is a luxury of good times ...
In difficult times, pessimism is
The truth is, we can build a better world,
and we can do so right now.
We have the tools: we saw a hint of that a moment ago,
and we're coming up with new ones all the time.
We have the knowledge,
and our understanding of the planet improves every day.
Most importantly, we have the motive:
we have a world that needs fixing, and nobody's going to do it for us.
and write up every day have some important aspects in common:
transparency, collaboration, a willingness to experiment,
and an appreciation of science -- or, more appropriately, science!
The majority of models, tools and ideas on Worldchanging
encompass combinations of these characteristics, so I want to give you
a few concrete examples of how these principles combine
in world-changing ways.
to make the invisible visible -- that is,
to make apparent the conditions of the world around us
that would otherwise be largely imperceptible.
when they can see and understand the impact of their actions.
As a small example, many of us have experienced
the change in driving behavior that comes from having
a real time display of mileage showing precisely
how one's driving habits affect the vehicle's efficiency.
The last few years have all seen the rise of innovations
in how we measure and display aspects of the world
that can be too big, or too intangible, or too slippery to grasp easily.
Simple technologies, like wall-mounted devices
that display how much power your household is using,
and what kind of results you'll get if you turn off a few lights --
these can actually have a direct positive impact
on your energy footprint.
Community tools, like text messaging, that can tell you
when pollen counts are up or smog levels are rising
or a natural disaster is unfolding,
can give you the information you need to act in a timely fashion.
Data-rich displays like maps of campaign contributions,
or maps of the disappearing polar ice caps,
allow us to better understand the context and the flow
of processes that affect us all.
that seek to meet the world's medical needs
through open access to data and collaborative action.
Now, some people emphasize the risks of knowledge-enabled dangers,
are far more important.
For example, open-access journals, like the Public Library of Science,
make cutting-edge scientific research free to all --
everyone in the world.
And actually, a growing number of science publishers
are adopting this model.
Last year, hundreds of volunteer biology and chemistry researchers
around the world worked together
to sequence the genome of the parasite responsible
for some of the developing world's worst diseases:
African sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and Chagas disease.
That genome data can now be found
on open-access genetic data banks around the world,
and it's an enormous boon to researchers
trying to come up with treatments.
But my favorite example has to be the global response
to the SARS epidemic in 2003, 2004, which relied on
worldwide access to the full gene sequence of the SARS virus.
The U.S. National Research Council
in its follow-up report on the outbreak specifically
cited this open availability of the sequence as a key reason
why the treatment for SARS could be developed so quickly.
in something as humble as a cell phone.
I can probably count on my fingers the number of people in this room
who do not use a mobile phone --
For many of us, cell phones have really become
almost an extension of ourselves,
and we're really now beginning to see the social changes
that mobile phones can bring about.
You may already know some of the big-picture aspects:
globally, more camera phones were sold last year
than any other kind of camera,
and a growing number of people live lives mediated through the lens,
and over the network -- and sometimes enter history books.
In the developing world, mobile phones have become economic drivers.
A study last year showed a direct correlation
between the growth of mobile phone use
and subsequent GDP increases across Africa.
In Kenya, mobile phone minutes
have actually become an alternative currency.
The political aspects of mobile phones can't be ignored either,
from text message swarms in Korea helping to bring down a government,
to the Blairwatch Project in the UK,
keeping tabs on politicians who try to avoid the press.
Pervasive, always-on networks, high quality sound and video,
even devices made to be worn instead of carried in the pocket,
will transform how we live on a scale that few really appreciate.
may be among the world's most important technologies.
And in this rapidly evolving context,
it's possible to imagine a world in which the mobile phone becomes
something far more than a medium for social interaction.
and Peter Gabriel told us more details about it on Wednesday,
in his profoundly moving presentation.
And I'm just incredibly happy to see the news
to enable users of digital cameras and camera phones
to send in their recordings over the Internet,
rather than just hand-carrying the videotape.
Not only does this add a new and potentially safer avenue
for documenting abuses,
it opens up the program to the growing global digital generation.
Imagine a Web portal collecting recordings and evidence
of what's happening to the planet:
putting news and data at the fingertips of people of all kinds,
to businesspeople and political figures.
It would highlight the changes that are underway,
but would more importantly give voice
to the people who are willing to work
to see a new world, a better world, come about.
It would give everyday citizens
a chance to play a role in the protection of the planet.
It would be, in essence, an "Earth Witness" project.
Now, just to be clear, in this talk I'm using the name "Earth Witness"
as part of the scenario, simply as a shorthand,
for what this imaginary project could aspire to,
not to piggyback on the wonderful work of the Witness organization.
It could just as easily be called, "Environmental Transparency Project,"
"Smart Mobs for Natural Security" --
but Earth Witness is a lot easier to say.
would focus on ecological problems, human-caused or otherwise,
especially environmental crimes
and significant sources of greenhouse gases and emissions.
We need better documentation of what's happening to the planet
if we're ever going to have a chance of repairing the damage.
But the Earth Witness project wouldn't need to be limited to problems.
In the best Worldchanging tradition,
it might also serve as a showcase for good ideas, successful projects
and efforts to make a difference that deserve much more visibility.
Earth Witness would show us two worlds:
the world we're leaving behind,
and the world we're building for generations to come.
we could do it today.
The key components are already widely available.
Camera phones, of course, would be fundamental to the project.
to always-on, widely available information tools.
We may not remember to bring our digital cameras with us
wherever we go, but very few of us forget our phones.
You could even imagine a version of this scenario
in which people actually build their own phones.
Over the course of last year, open-source hardware hackers
have come up with multiple models
for usable, Linux-based mobile phones,
and the Earth Phone could spin off from this kind of project.
At the other end of the network, there'd be
a server for people to send photos and messages to,
accessible over the Web, combining a photo-sharing service,
social networking platforms and a collaborative filtering system.
Now, you Web 2.0 folks in the audience know what I'm talking about,
but for those of you for whom that last sentence
the online part of the Earth Witness project
would be created by the users, working together and working openly.
That's enough right there to start to build a compelling chronicle
of what's now happening to our planet, but we could do more.
for all sorts of data about conditions around the planet
picked up by environmental sensors that attach to your cell phone.
Now, you don't see these devices as add-ons for phones yet,
but students and engineers around the world
and cheap robots and the backs of pigeons --
that being a project that's actually underway right now at U.C. Irvine,
using bird-mounted sensors
as a way of measuring smog-forming pollution.
It's hardly a stretch to imagine putting the same thing
on a phone carried by a person.
Now, the idea of connecting a sensor to your phone is not new:
phone-makers around the world offer phones that sniff for bad breath,
or tell you to worry about too much sun exposure.
Swedish firm Uppsala Biomedical, more seriously, makes
a mobile phone add-on that can process blood tests in the field,
uploading the data, displaying the results.
Even the Lawrence Livermore National Labs have gotten into the act,
designing a prototype phone
that has radiation sensors to find dirty bombs.
on the market, and you can easily imagine someone putting together
a phone that could measure temperature, CO2 or methane levels,
the presence of some biotoxins --
potentially, in a few years, maybe even H5N1 avian flu virus.
would actually be a really good fit
with Larry Brilliant's InSTEDD project.
Now, all of this data could be tagged with geographic information
and mashed up with online maps for easy viewing and analysis.
And that's worth noting in particular.
The impact of open-access online maps over the last year or two
has been simply phenomenal.
Developers around the world have come up with
an amazing variety of ways to layer useful data on top of the maps,
from bus routes and crime statistics
to the global progress of avian flu.
Earth Witness would take this further, linking what you see
with what thousands or millions of other people see around the world.
if something like this ever existed.
We'd have a far better -- far better knowledge
of what's happening on our planet environmentally
than could be gathered with satellites
It would be a collaborative, bottom-up approach
to environmental awareness and protection,
able to respond to emerging concerns in a smart mobs kind of way --
and if you need greater sensor density, just have more people show up.
you can't ignore how important mobile phones are to global youth.
This is a system that could put the next generation
at the front lines of gathering environmental data.
And as we work to figure out ways to mitigate
the worst effects of climate disruption,
every little bit of information matters.
A system like Earth Witness would be a tool for all of us
to participate in the improvement of our knowledge and, ultimately,
the improvement of the planet itself.
there are thousands upon thousands of good ideas out there,
so why have I spent the bulk of my time
telling you about something that doesn't exist?
Because this is what tomorrow could look like:
to handle the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced.
We can save the planet, but we can't do it alone -- we need each other.
Nobody's going to fix the world for us, but working together,
making use of technological innovations and human communities alike,
We have at our fingertips a cornucopia of compelling models,
powerful tools, and innovative ideas
that can make a meaningful difference in our planet's future.
We don't need to wait for a magic bullet to save us all;
we already have an arsenal of solutions just waiting to be used.
There's a staggering array of wonders out there,
across diverse disciplines, all telling us the same thing:
success can be ours if we're willing to try.
And as we say at Worldchanging,
another world isn't just possible; another world is here.
We just need to open our eyes. Thank you very much.
I had requested slides,
kind of adamantly,
up till the -- pretty much, last few days,
but was denied access to a slide projector.
(Laughter)
I actually find them a lot more emotional --
(Laughter)
-- and personal,
and the neat thing about a slide projector
is you can actually focus the work,
unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.
Now, I agree that
you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions
and, you know, if you use a slide projector,
you're not able to have the bad type
swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,
but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,
to trade that off for a focus.
(Laughter)
It's a thought. Just a thought.
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.
And the thing you really hope for
is occasionally they burn up,
which we won't see tonight. So.
This, as many of you have probably guessed,
is a
recently emptied beer can in Portugal.
(Laughter)
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,
and I thought --
you know, fly all night, I looked up,
and I thought, wow, how clean.
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.
I mean, how nice is that?
Everything's gotten simpler in design,
and here's this mega airport,
and God, I just -- I took a picture.
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.
Till a couple months later,
I went back to the same airport --
same plane, I think -- and looked up,
and it said C.
(Laughter)
It was only then that I realized
it was simply a gate that I was coming into.
(Laughter)
and the message that's sent
before somebody begins to read,
before they get the rest of the information;
what is the emotional response they get to the product,
to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.
That area of design interests me the most,
and I think this for me is a real clear,
very simplified version
of what I'm talking about.
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,
situated next to each other.
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.
You know, it's pretty clear.
Take a look at the second door and see
if there's any different message.
O.K., which one would you park in front of?
(Laughter)
Same color, same message, same words.
The only thing that's different
is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece --
and, again,
which is the psycho-killer here?
(Laughter)
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.
I would probably park in front of the other one.
that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last
five years or so.
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of
come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,
and was very happy to
see that apparently this idea of minimalism
has even been translated by the graffiti artist.
(Laughter)
And this graffiti artist has come along,
made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.
(Laughter)
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.
(Laughter)
I took some photos, and this is
a billboard in Florida,
and either they hadn't paid their rent,
or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,
and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,
so they just teared out sections of it.
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective
than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,
getting you to look over that way.
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.
The first book is called, "The End of Print,"
and it was done along with a film,
working with William Burroughs.
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.
(Laughter)
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,
he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.
And I said, well, that's fine;
I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,
and he finally agreed to it.
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice
that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,
"I remember attending an exhibition called,
'Photography: The End of Painting.'"
And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."
So, apparently when photography was perfected,
there were people going around saying,
that's it: you've just ruined painting.
People are just going to take pictures now.
And of course, that wasn't the case.
a book I did on intuition.
I think it's not the only ingredient in design,
but possibly the most important.
It's something everybody has.
It's not a matter of teaching it;
in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition
as an ingredient of your working process
because they can't quantify it:
it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,
but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card
or a newsletter.
So it tends to get discounted.
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,
"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.
There comes a leap in consciousness --
call it intuition or what you will --
and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?
And the more you try to think about it,
the further the answer gets from you,
and the minute you stop thinking about it,
your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.
So, what is the message sent before
somebody actually gets into the material?
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,
and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall
that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,
predicting so much of what has happened
in the advertising, television, media world.
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before,
and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.
So, this was the contents page originally.
When I got done it was 540 pages,
and then the publisher, Gingko Press,
ended up cutting it down considerably:
it's just under 400 pages now.
But I decided I liked this contents page --
I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.
(Laughter)
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,
but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.
(Laughter)
here McLuhan says,
"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity,
fostering ideas of literary fame
and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"
which had never been done before printing.
"When new technologies impose themselves
on societies long habituated to older technologies,
anxieties of all kinds result."
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,
they always form vivid images of the preceding world."
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,
and no possible occupation except information gathering."
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,
and it was done right after 9/11.
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter
in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA
that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.
(Laughter)
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,
and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."
I was, O.K.; that's fine.
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,
and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,
and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,
and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,
and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.
where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence
and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.
So, this is a six-shot sequence.
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.
And then the tiny line of copy says,
If you want to see this entire sequence --
how this whole ride was -- go to the website.
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site
to get this entire picture.
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.
(Laughter)
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.
asked me to do these posters.
They were wild-posted around New York City.
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all --
but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
-- but I did.
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,
and there were definitely some heads turning,
you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"
(Laughter)
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;
it looked like they might be real. Anyway.
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas,
and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell --
not that they will sell --
that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.
This was either an old product with new packaging,
or a brand-new package, and I just thought,
Yikes! How's that still happening?
and this particular assignment was
to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.
(Laughter)
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.
The students actually cut them up
and put them up around bars and restaurants that night,
and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...
(Laughter)
It was a worldwide branding campaign.
And it was interesting to me --
my background is in sociology; I had no design training,
and sometimes people say, well, that explains it --
but it was a very interesting experiment
because there's no product that I had to sell;
it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.
They thought some people didn't like them.
(Laughter)
I found out that's very true,
working on this campaign worldwide.
and what I did was add type and people to the ad,
which the previous campaign had not had,
and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.
And we were trying to say that,
hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;
some of them actually have friends and family,
and they're not all awful people.
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."
So, we tried to take this --
what was perceived as a negative:
their over-competitiveness, their,
you know, long working hours --
and turn it into a positive and not run from it.
You know: Thank God it's Monday --
I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,
and hear everybody else's conversations f
or 10 hours and then go home.
because they were all elaborately art-directed,
and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.
And this is how the ad ran around the world.
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me --
nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies --
but see if you can tell the difference.
This is how the ad ran throughout the world;
Germany made one slight change in the ad.
(Laughter)
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.
(Laughter)
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...
(Laughter)
And then as the agency explained to me, they said,
"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;
why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;
I think it's a very small-minded approach,
the world is certainly much more global,
and I certainly think the people of Germany
could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,
though we'll never know.
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles,
listen to the music, and try to interpret it.
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.
This is an opener for Brian Eno,
and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.
(Laughter)
so I set the whole article in Dingbat.
(Laughter)
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:
it is the actual article.
I suppose you could eventually decode it,
but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.
(Laughter)
I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,
and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.
And I was basically pretty disappointed
to see that they had
chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,
which was basically the moment of impact.
And People magazine, I thought,
got probably the best shot.
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture --
the second plane not quite hitting:
there was something more enticing,
if that's the right -- it's not the right word --
but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.
there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.
Look at the image of this lady --
who knows what she's going through? --
and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's --
unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.
It did not let up.
This says: "One clean fits all." .
There were a lot of orphans made this day,
and here's a dead body being brought out.
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page
would have been more appropriate.
And this one I think is possibly the worst:
two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.
One -- who knows what she's going through;
the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.
I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,
and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that --
they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk,
and when they got back to their car,
they found a note on their car that made them think
maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event --
it had been a few months.
This was what they found on their car.
(Laughter)
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,
but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders,
but I don't know what they are.
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.
We are wrapping up.
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,
because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,
you can now get a plate in the keyboard,
so there's no more faking it --
that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient
to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...
I'm just not sure this is improvement.
this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.
And this to me is an extreme case
of the power of emotion, of graphic design,
even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.
As we get more technically driven,
the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.
You have to utilize who you are in your work.
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,
from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,
and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.
and I thought this was a great example of both.
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly --
that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.
(Laughter)
But more importantly,
she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.
And I'm thinking, yeah, right,
I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,
and you get charged by this thing and you go,
oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.
(Laughter)
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.
(Laughter)
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk
about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,
who was a test pilot, and he told me that
when you signed up to become a test pilot,
they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance
of death on the job.
That's pretty high for most occupations.
(Laughter)
But, you know, the government would make a plane;
they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?
Some of them did; some of them didn't.
between, like, serif versus san-serif.
(Laughter)
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?
Why not put some of yourself into the work?
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,
What's the definition of a good job?
And as teachers, after you get all the answers,
you like to give them the correct answer.
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this --
the definition of a good job is:
If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue --
would you be doing that same work?
And if you would, you've got a great job.
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?
You're going to be dead a really long time.
Thank you very much.
What's happening in genomics,
and how this revolution is about to change everything we know
about the world, life, ourselves, and how we think about them.
and you heard the boom, boom, boom, boom, and you saw the monolith,
you know, that was Arthur C. Clarke's representation
that we were at a seminal moment in the evolution of our species.
In this case, it was picking up bones and creating a tool,
using it as a tool, which meant that apes just, sort of,
running around and eating and doing each other
figured out they can make things if they used a tool.
And that moved us to the next level.
have seen this acceleration in knowledge and technology,
and technology has bred more knowledge and given us tools.
And we've seen many seminal moments.
We've seen the creation of small computers in the '70s and early '80s,
and who would have thought back then that every single person
would not have just one computer but probably 20,
in your home, and in not just your P.C. but in every device --
in your washing machine, your cell phone.
You're walking around; your car has 12 microprocessors.
Then we go along and create the Internet
and connect the world together; we flatten the world.
these high-powered tools --
that are allowing us to turn the lens inward
into something that is common to all of us, and that is a genome.
Heard about it, at least? You probably hear about genomes these days.
It's, sort of, like if you ask people,
Well, what is a megabyte or megabit? And what is broadband?
People never want to say, I really don't understand.
So, I will tell you right off of the bat.
You've heard of DNA; you probably studied a little bit in biology.
A genome is really a description for all of the DNA that is in a living organism.
And one thing that is common to all of life is DNA.
It doesn't matter whether you're a yeast;
it doesn't matter whether you're a mouse;
doesn't matter whether you're a fly; we all have DNA.
The DNA is organized in words, call them: genes and chromosomes.
first decoded this beautiful double helix that we know as the DNA molecule --
very long, complicated molecule --
we then started on this journey to understand that
inside of that DNA is a language that determines the characteristics, our traits,
what we inherit, what diseases we may get.
We've also along the way discovered that this is a very old molecule,
that all of the DNA in your body has been around forever,
since the beginning of us, of us as creatures.
There is a historical archive.
and you as an individual human being, where you're from,
going back thousands and thousands and thousands of years,
and that's now starting to be understood.
But also, the genome is really the instruction manual.
It is the program. It is the code of life.
It is what makes you function;
it is what makes every organism function.
DNA is a very elegant molecule.
It's long and it's complicated.
Really all you have to know about it is that there's four letters:
A, T, C, G; they represent the name of a chemical.
And with these four letters, you can create a language:
a language that can describe anything, and very complicated things.
You know, they are generally put together in pairs,
creating a word or what we call base pairs.
And you would, you know, when you think about it,
four letters, or the representation of four things, makes us work.
but let me flip over to something else you know about, and that's computers.
Look at this screen here and, you know, you see pictures
and you see words, but really all there are are ones and zeros.
The language of technology is binary;
you've probably heard that at some point in time.
Everything that happens in digital is converted,
or a representation, of a one and a zero.
So, when you're listening to iTunes and your favorite music,
that's really just a bunch of ones and zeros playing very quickly.
When you're seeing these pictures, it's all ones and zeros,
and when you're talking on your telephone, your cell phone,
and it's going over the network,
your voice is all being turned into ones and zeros and magically whizzed around.
And look at all the complex things and wonderful things
we've been able to create with just a one and a zero.
a lot of ways to describe mechanisms.
So, let's talk about what that means.
So, if you look at a human genome,
they consist of 3.2 billion of these base pairs. That's a lot.
And they mix up in all different fashions,
and that makes you a human being.
If you convert that to binary, just to give you a little bit of sizing,
we're actually smaller than the program Microsoft Office.
It's not really all that much data.
I will also tell you we're at least as buggy.
(Laughter)
that I have struggled with for a long, long time.
When you get sick, it is a bug in your genome.
In fact, many, many diseases we have struggled with for a long time,
like cancer, we haven't been able to cure
because we just don't understand how it works at the genomic level.
We are starting to understand that.
by using what I call shit-against-the-wall pharmacology,
which means, well, let's just throw chemicals at it,
and maybe it's going to make it work.
But if you really understand why does a cell go from normal cell to cancer?
What is the code?
What are the exact instructions that are making it do that?
then you can go about the process of trying to fix it and figure it out.
So, for your next dinner over a great bottle of wine, here's a few factoids for you.
We have about a hundred, 120,000 others
that don't appear to function every day,
but represent this archival history of how we used to work as a species
going back tens of thousands of years.
You might also be interested in knowing
that a mouse has about the same amount of genes.
so the number of genes you have may not necessarily represent the complexity
or the evolutionary order of any particular species.
Now, look around: just look next to your neighbor,
look forward, look backward. We all look pretty different.
A lot of very handsome and pretty people here, skinny, chubby,
different races, cultures. We are all 99.9% genetically equal.
It is one one-hundredth of one percent of genetic material
that makes the difference between any one of us.
That's a tiny amount of material,
but the way that ultimately expresses itself
is what makes changes in humans and in all species.
The first human genome took 10 years, three billion dollars.
It was done by Dr. Craig Venter.
And then James Watson's -- one of the co-founders of DNA --
genome was done for two million dollars, and in just two months.
And if you think about the computer industry
and how we've gone from big computers to little ones
and how they get more powerful and faster all the time,
the same thing is happening with gene sequencing now:
we are on the cusp of being able to sequence human genomes
for about 5,000 dollars in about an hour or a half-hour;
you will see that happen in the next five years.
with your own personal genome on a smart card. It will be here.
And when you buy medicine,
you won't be buying a drug that's used for everybody.
You will give your genome to the pharmacist,
and your drug will be made for you
and it will work much better than the ones that were --
you won't have side effects.
All those side effects, you know, oily residue and, you know,
whatever they say in those commercials: forget about that.
They're going to make all that stuff go away.
Well, there it is. It is a long, long series of these base pairs.
If you saw the genome for a mouse or for a human it would look no different than this,
but what scientists are doing now is
they're understanding what these do and what they mean.
Because what Nature is doing is double-clicking all the time.
In other words, the first couple of sentences here,
assuming this is a grape plant:
make a root, make a branch, create a blossom.
In a human being, down in here it could be:
make blood cells, start cancer.
For me it may be: every calorie you consume, you conserve,
because I come from a very cold climate.
For my wife: eat three times as much and you never put on any weight.
It's all hidden in this code,
and it's starting to be understood at breakneck pace.
now that we're starting to have the book of life?
Well, there's many things. Some are exciting.
Some people will find very scary. I will tell you a couple of things
that will probably make you want to projectile puke on me, but that's okay.
So, you know, we now can learn the history of organisms.
You can find out where your relatives come from;
you can do your genealogy going back thousands of years.
We can understand functionality. This is really important.
We can understand, for example, why we create plaque in our arteries,
what creates the starchiness inside of a grain,
why does yeast metabolize sugar and produce carbon dioxide.
We can also look at, at a grander scale, what creates problems,
what creates disease, and how we may be able to fix them.
Because we can understand this,
we can fix them, make better organisms.
is that Nature has provided us a spectacular toolbox.
The toolbox exists.
An architect far better and smarter than us has given us that toolbox,
and we now have the ability to use it.
We are now not just reading genomes; we are writing them.
created the first full synthetic genome for a little bug,
a very primitive creature called Mycoplasma genitalium.
If you have a UTI, you've probably -- or ever had a UTI --
you've come in contact with this little bug.
Very simple -- only has about 246 genes --
but we were able to completely synthesize that genome.
Now, you have the genome and you say to yourself,
So, if I plug this synthetic genome -- if I pull the old one out and plug it in --
does it just boot up and live?
Well, guess what. It does.
and you plugged it into a different critter, like yeast,
you now turn that yeast into Mycoplasma.
It's, sort of, like booting up a PC with a Mac O.S. software.
Well, actually, you could do it the other way.
So, you know, by being able to write a genome
and plug it into an organism,
the software, if you will, changes the hardware.
And this is extremely profound.
they got together and they went ahead and they sequenced Pinot Noir.
The genomic sequence now exists for the entire Pinot Noir organism,
and they identified, once again, about 29,000 genes.
They have discovered pathways that create flavors,
although it's very important to understand
that those compounds that it's cranking out
have to match a receptor in our genome, in our tongue,
for us to understand and interpret those flavors.
there's a heck of a lot of activity going on producing aroma as well.
They've identified areas of vulnerability to disease.
They now are understanding, and the work is going on,
exactly how this plant works, and we have the capability to know,
to read that entire code and understand how it ticks.
So, then what do you do?
Knowing that we can read it, knowing that we can write it, change it,
maybe write its genome from scratch. So, what do you do?
Well, one thing you could do is what some people might call Franken-Noir.
(Laughter)
By the way, just so you know:
you get stressed out about genetically modified organisms;
there is not one single vine in this valley or anywhere
that is not genetically modified.
They're not grown from seeds; they're grafted into root stock;
they would not exist in nature on their own.
So, we could, you know, focus on disease resistance;
we can go for higher yields without necessarily having
dramatic farming techniques to do it, or costs.
We could conceivably expand the climate window:
we could make Pinot Noir grow maybe in Long Island, God forbid.
(Laughter)
You want a little more raspberry, a little more chocolate here or there?
All of these things could conceivably be done,
and I will tell you I'd pretty much bet that it will be done.
But there's an ecosystem here.
In other words, we're not, sort of, unique little organisms running around;
we are part of a big ecosystem.
that inside of your digestive tract is about 10 pounds of microbes
which you're circulating through your body quite a bit.
Our ocean's teaming with microbes;
in fact, when Craig Venter went and sequenced the microbes in the ocean,
in the first three months tripled the known species on the planet
by discovering all-new microbes in the first 20 feet of water.
We now understand that those microbes have more impact on our climate
and regulating CO2 and oxygen than plants do,
which we always thought oxygenate the atmosphere.
in ice, in coal, in rocks, in volcanic vents; it's an amazing thing.
But we've also discovered, when it comes to plants, in plants,
as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes,
it is the ecosystem around them,
it is the microbes that live in their root systems,
that have just as much impact on the character of those plants
as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves.
you will find there are many, many, many diverse microbial colonies.
This is not big news to viticulturists;
they have been, you know, concerned with water and fertilization.
And, again, this is, sort of, my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology:
you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in.
You don't necessarily know with granularity
exactly what organisms are providing what flavors and what characteristics.
We can start to figure that out.
We all talk about terroir; we worship terroir;
we say, Wow, is my terroir great! It's so special.
I've got this piece of land and it creates terroir like you wouldn't believe.
we say it's climate, it's soil, it's this. Well, guess what?
We can figure out what the heck terroir is.
It's in there, waiting to be sequenced.
There are thousands of microbes there.
They're easy to sequence: unlike a human,
they, you know, have a thousand, two thousand genes;
we can figure out what they are.
sequence them, correlate them to the kinds of characteristics we like and don't like --
that's just a big database -- and then fertilize.
And then we understand what is terroir.
So, some people will say, Oh, my God, are we playing God?
Are we now, if we engineer organisms, are we playing God?
And, you know, people would always ask James Watson --
he's not always the most politically correct guy ...
(Laughter)
... and they would say, "Are, you know, are you playing God?"
And he had the best answer I ever heard to this question:
"Well, somebody has to."
(Laughter)
and without, you know, the organized religion part,
and I will tell you: I don't believe there's anything unnatural.
I don't believe that chemicals are unnatural.
I told you I'm going to make some of you puke.
It's very simple: we don't invent molecules, compounds.
They're here. They're in the universe.
We reorganize things, we change them around,
but we don't make anything unnatural.
we can poison ourselves; we can poison the Earth --
but that's just a natural outcome of a mistake we made.
So, what's happening today is, Nature is presenting us with a toolbox,
and we find that this toolbox is very extensive.
There are microbes out there that actually make gasoline, believe it or not.
There are microbes, you know -- go back to yeast.
These are chemical factories;
the most sophisticated chemical factories are provided by Nature,
and we now can use those.
There also is a set of rules.
we could engineer a grape plant, but guess what.
We can't make the grape plant produce babies.
Nature has put a set of rules out there.
We can work within the rules; we can't break the rules;
we're just learning what the rules are.
I just ask the question, if you could cure all disease --
if you could make disease go away,
because we understand how it actually works,
if we could end hunger by being able to create nutritious, healthy plants
that grow in very hard-to-grow environments,
if we could create clean and plentiful energy --
we, right in the labs at Synthetic Genomics,
have single-celled organisms that are taking carbon dioxide
and producing a molecule very similar to gasoline.
So, carbon dioxide -- the stuff we want to get rid of -- not sugar, not anything.
Carbon dioxide, a little bit of sunlight,
you end up with a lipid that is highly refined.
We could solve our energy problems; we can reduce CO2,;
we could clean up our oceans; we could make better wine.
If we could, would we?
Well, you know, I think the answer is very simple:
working with Nature, working with this tool set that we now understand,
is the next step in humankind's evolution.
If you can stay healthy for 20 years, you'll see 150, maybe 300.
Sheryl Shade: Hi, Aimee. Aimee Mullins: Hi.
and I wanted her to tell all of you what makes her a distinctive athlete.
it might have given it away --
I'm a double amputee, and I was born without fibulas in both legs.
I was amputated at age one,
and I've been running like hell ever since, all over the place.
Why don't we start there?
I won a full academic scholarship out of high school.
They pick three students out of the nation every year
to get involved in international affairs,
and so I won a full ride to Georgetown
and I've been there for four years. Love it.
she decided that she's, kind of, curious about track and field,
so she decided to call someone and start asking about it.
So, why don't you tell that story?
I played softball for five years growing up.
I skied competitively throughout high school,
and I got a little restless in college
because I wasn't doing anything for about a year or two sports-wise.
And I'd never competed on a disabled level, you know --
I'd always competed against other able-bodied athletes.
That's all I'd ever known.
In fact, I'd never even met another amputee until I was 17.
And I heard that they do these track meets with all disabled runners,
and I figured, "Oh, I don't know about this,
but before I judge it, let me go see what it's all about."
So, I booked myself a flight to Boston in '95, 19 years old
and definitely the dark horse candidate at this race. I'd never done it before.
I went out on a gravel track a couple of weeks before this meet
to see how far I could run,
and about 50 meters was enough for me, panting and heaving.
And I had these legs that were made of
a wood and plastic compound, attached with Velcro straps --
big, thick, five-ply wool socks on --
you know, not the most comfortable things, but all I'd ever known.
wearing legs made of all things -- carbon graphite
and, you know, shock absorbers in them and all sorts of things --
and they're all looking at me like,
OK, we know who's not going to win this race.
And, I mean, I went up there expecting --
I don't know what I was expecting --
but, you know, when I saw a man who was missing an entire leg
go up to the high jump, hop on one leg to the high jump
and clear it at six feet, two inches ...
Dan O'Brien jumped 5'11" in '96 in Atlanta,
I mean, if it just gives you a comparison of --
these are truly accomplished athletes,
without qualifying that word "athlete."
And so I decided to give this a shot: heart pounding,
I ran my first race and I beat the national record-holder
by three hundredths of a second,
and became the new national record-holder on my first try out.
"Aimee, you know, you've got speed -- you've got natural speed --
but you don't have any skill or finesse going down that track.
You were all over the place.
We all saw how hard you were working."
And so I decided to call the track coach at Georgetown.
And I thank god I didn't know just how huge this man is in the track and field world.
He's coached five Olympians, and
the man's office is lined from floor to ceiling
with All America certificates
of all these athletes he's coached.
He's just a rather intimidating figure.
And I called him up and said, "Listen, I ran one race and I won ..."
I need to just see if I can sit in on some of your practices,
see what drills you do and whatever."
That's all I wanted -- just two practices.
"Can I just sit in and see what you do?"
And he said, "Well, we should meet first, before we decide anything."
You know, he's thinking, "What am I getting myself into?"
So, I met the man, walked in his office,
and saw these posters and magazine covers of people he has coached.
And we got to talking,
and it turned out to be a great partnership
because he'd never coached a disabled athlete,
so therefore he had no preconceived notions
of what I was or wasn't capable of,
and I'd never been coached before.
So this was like, "Here we go -- let's start on this trip."
his free time, and I would come up to the track and train with him.
So that's how I met Frank.
That was fall of '95. But then, by the time that winter was rolling around,
he said, "You know, you're good enough.
You can run on our women's track team here."
And I said, "No, come on."
And he said, "No, no, really. You can.
You can run with our women's track team."
In the spring of 1996, with my goal of making the U.S. Paralympic team
that May coming up full speed, I joined the women's track team.
And no disabled person had ever done that -- run at a collegiate level.
So I don't know, it started to become an interesting mix.
a couple of memorable events happened at Georgetown.
Why don't you just tell them?
AM: Yes, well, you know, I'd won everything as far as the disabled meets --
everything I competed in -- and, you know, training in Georgetown
and knowing that I was going to have to get used to
seeing the backs of all these women's shirts --
you know, I'm running against the next Flo-Jo --
and they're all looking at me like,
"Hmm, what's, you know, what's going on here?"
And putting on my Georgetown uniform
and going out there and knowing that, you know,
in order to become better -- and I'm already the best in the country --
you know, you have to train with people who are inherently better than you.
which was sort of the championship race at the end of the season.
It was really, really hot.
And it's the first --
I had just gotten these new sprinting legs that you see in that bio,
and I didn't realize at that time that
the amount of sweating I would be doing in the sock --
it actually acted like a lubricant
and I'd be, kind of, pistoning in the socket.
And at about 85 meters of my 100 meters sprint, in all my glory,
I came out of my leg.
Like, I almost came out of it, in front of, like, 5,000 people.
And I, I mean, was just mortified --
because I was signed up for the 200, you know, which went off in a half hour.
I can't do this in front of all those people. My legs will come off.
And if it came off at 85 there's no way I'm going 200 meters.
And he just sat there like this.
My pleas fell on deaf ears, thank god.
Because you know, the man is from Brooklyn;
he's a big man. He says, "Aimee, so what if your leg falls off?
You pick it up, you put the damn thing back on,
and finish the goddamn race!"
And I did. So, he kept me in line.
He kept me on the right track.
and she's all excited. Her family's coming down -- it's a big deal.
It's now two years that you've been running?
right before you go run your race?
The Paralympics, just for a little bit of clarification,
are the Olympics for people with physical disabilities --
amputees, persons with cerebral palsy, and wheelchair athletes --
as opposed to the Special Olympics,
which deals with people with mental disabilities.
So, here we are, a week after the Olympics and down at Atlanta,
and I'm just blown away by the fact that
just a year ago, I got out on a gravel track and couldn't run 50 meters.
And so, here I am -- never lost.
I set new records at the U.S. Nationals -- the Olympic trials -- that May,
and was sure that I was coming home with the gold.
I was also the only, what they call "bilateral BK" -- below the knee.
I was the only woman who would be doing the long jump.
I had just done the long jump,
and a guy who was missing two legs came up to me and says,
"How do you do that? You know, we're supposed to have a planar foot,
so we can't get off on the springboard."
I said, "Well, I just did it. No one told me that."
and kept on from that point, you know,
so I'm signed up in the long jump -- signed up?
No, I made it for the long jump and the 100-meter.
And I'm sure of it, you know?
I made the front page of my hometown paper
that I delivered for six years, you know?
It was, like, this is my time for shine.
And we're at the trainee warm-up track,
which is a few blocks away from the Olympic stadium.
These legs that I was on, which I'll take out right now --
I was the first person in the world on these legs.
I was the guinea pig., I'm telling you,
this was, like -- talk about a tourist attraction.
And I'm always looking around, like, where is my competition?
It's my first international meet.
I tried to get it out of anybody I could,
you know, "Who am I running against here?"
"Oh, Aimee, we'll have to get back to you on that one."
I wanted to find out times.
"Don't worry, you're doing great."
This is 20 minutes before my race in the Olympic stadium,
and they post the heat sheets. And I go over and look.
And my fastest time, which was the world record, was 15.77.
Then I'm looking: the next lane, lane two, is 12.8.
Lane three is 12.5. Lane four is 12.2. I said, "What's going on?"
And they shove us all into the shuttle bus,
and all the women there are missing a hand.
they're all looking at me like 'which one of these is not like the other,' you know?
I'm sitting there, like, "Oh, my god. Oh, my god."
You know, I'd never lost anything,
like, whether it would be the scholarship or, you know,
I'd won five golds when I skied. In everything, I came in first.
And Georgetown -- that was great.
I was losing, but it was the best training because this was Atlanta.
Here we are, like, crème de la crème,
and there is no doubt about it, that I'm going to lose big.
And, you know, I'm just thinking,
"Oh, my god, my whole family got in a van
and drove down here from Pennsylvania."
And, you know, I was the only female U.S. sprinter.
So they call us out and, you know --
"Ladies, you have one minute."
And I remember putting my blocks in and just feeling horrified
because there was just this murmur coming over the crowd,
like, the ones who are close enough to the starting line to see.
And I'm like, "I know! Look! This isn't right."
And I'm thinking that's my last card to play here;
if I'm not going to beat these girls,
I'm going to mess their heads a little, you know?
and everyone else -- Estonia and Poland -- was in this heat.
And the gun went off, and all I remember was
finishing last and
fighting back tears of frustration and incredible -- incredible --
this feeling of just being overwhelmed.
And I had to think, "Why did I do this?"
If I had won everything -- but it was like, what was the point?
All this training -- I had transformed my life.
I became a collegiate athlete, you know. I became an Olympic athlete.
And it made me really think about how
the achievement was getting there.
I mean, the fact that I set my sights, just a year and three months before,
on becoming an Olympic athlete and saying,
"Here's my life going in this direction --
and I want to take it here for a while,
and just seeing how far I could push it."
How many people gave of their time and their expertise,
and their patience, to deal with me?
And that was this collective glory --
that there was, you know, 50 people behind me
that had joined in this incredible experience of going to Atlanta.
So, I apply this sort of philosophy now
to everything I do:
sitting back and realizing the progression,
how far you've come at this day to this goal, you know.
It's important to focus on a goal, I think, but
also recognize the progression on the way there
and how you've grown as a person.
That's the achievement, I think. That's the real achievement.
SS: You know, show us more than one set of legs.
and they're absolutely beautiful.
You've got to come up and see them.
There are hair follicles on them, and I can paint my toenails.
And, seriously, like, I can wear heels.
Like, you guys don't understand what that's like
to be able to just go into a shoe store and buy whatever you want.
SS: You got to pick your height?
AM: I got to pick my height, exactly.
comes back every summer.
And I had incessant fun making fun of him in the training room
because he'd come in with foot injuries.
I'm like, "Get it off! Don't worry about it, you know.
You can be eight feet tall. Just take them off."
OK, now, these are my sprinting legs, made of carbon graphite,
like I said, and I've got to make sure I've got the right socket.
No, I've got so many legs in here.
These are -- do you want to hold that actually?
That's another leg I have for, like, tennis and softball.
It has a shock absorber in it so it, like, "Shhhh," makes this neat sound
when you jump around on it. All right.
And then this is the silicon sheath I roll over,
to keep it on. Which, when I sweat,
you know, I'm pistoning out of it.
I may be a little taller. I actually can put both of them on.
and balance is a little bit of an art in them.
But without having the silicon sock, I'm just going to try slip in it.
And so, I run on these, and have shocked half the world on these.
If you ever watch a sprinter,
the ball of their foot is the only thing that ever hits the track.
So when I stand in these legs,
my hamstring and my glutes are contracted,
as they would be had I had feet and were standing on the ball of my feet.
And I was a guinea pig, as I hope to continue to be
in every new form of prosthetic limbs that come out.
But actually these, like I said, are still the actual prototype.
I need to get some new ones because the last meet I was at, they were everywhere. You know,
it's like a big -- it's come full circle.
and we'll talk about the design of them.
about two hours south of London,
and I'm the only person in the United States with these,
which is a crime because they are so beautiful.
And I don't even mean, like, because of the toes and everything.
For me, while I'm such a serious athlete on the track,
I want to be feminine off the track, and I think it's so important
not to be limited in any capacity,
whether it's, you know, your mobility or even fashion.
I mean, I love the fact that I can go in anywhere
and pick out what I want -- the shoes I want, the skirts I want --
and I'm hoping to try to bring these over here
and make them accessible to a lot of people.
They're also silicon.
This is a really basic, basic prosthetic limb under here.
It's like a Barbie foot under this.
so I have to wear a two-inch heel.
And, I mean, it's really -- let me take this off so you can see it.
I don't know how good you can see it, but, like, it really is.
There're veins on the feet, and then my heel is pink,
and my Achilles' tendon -- that moves a little bit.
And it's really an amazing store. I got them a year and two weeks ago.
And this is just a silicon piece of skin.
I mean, what happened was, two years ago
this man in Belgium was saying, "God,
if I can go to Madame Tussauds' wax museum
and see Jerry Hall replicated down to the color of her eyes,
looking so real as if she breathed,
why can't they build a limb for someone
that looks like a leg, or an arm, or a hand?"
I mean, they make ears for burn victims.
They do amazing stuff with silicon.
And she came into town and she rushed around
and she said, "I have to buy some new shoes!"
We're an hour before the ESPYs,
and she thought she'd gotten a two-inch heel
but she'd actually bought a three-inch heel.
because it means I'm walking like that all night long.
They got someone to come in and saw off the shoes.
I said, "Look, do you have anybody here who could help me?
Because I have this problem ... "
You know, at first they were just going to write me off, like,
"If you don't like your shoes, sorry. It's too late."
"No, no, no, no. I've got these special feet
that need a two-inch heel. I have a three-inch heel.
I need a little bit off."
They didn't even want to go there.
They didn't even want to touch that one. They just did it.
No, these legs are great.
I'm actually going back in a couple of weeks
to get some improvements.
I want to get legs like these made for flat feet
so I can wear sneakers, because I can't with these ones.
So... Moderator: That's it.
I wrote a letter last week talking about the work of the foundation,
sharing some of the problems.
And Warren Buffet had recommended I do that --
being honest about what was going well, what wasn't,
and making it kind of an annual thing.
A goal I had there was to draw more people in to work on those problems,
because I think there are some very important problems
that don't get worked on naturally.
That is, the market does not drive the scientists,
the communicators, the thinkers, the governments
to do the right things.
And only by paying attention to these things
and having brilliant people who care and draw other people in
can we make as much progress as we need to.
and talk about where they stand.
But before I dive into those I want to admit that I am an optimist.
Any tough problem, I think it can be solved.
And part of the reason I feel that way is looking at the past.
Over the past century, average lifespan has more than doubled.
Another statistic, perhaps my favorite,
is to look at childhood deaths.
As recently as 1960, 110 million children were born,
and 20 million of those died before the age of five.
Five years ago, 135 million children were born -- so, more --
and less than 10 million of them died before the age of five.
So that's a factor of two reduction of the childhood death rate.
It's a phenomenal thing.
Each one of those lives matters a lot.
but also a few key breakthroughs:
vaccines that were used more widely.
For example, measles was four million of the deaths
back as recently as 1990
and now is under 400,000.
So we really can make changes.
The next breakthrough is to cut that 10 million in half again.
And I think that's doable in well under 20 years.
Why? Well there's only a few diseases
that account for the vast majority of those deaths:
diarrhea, pneumonia and malaria.
which is how do we stop a deadly disease that's spread by mosquitos?
It's been a severe disease for thousands of years.
In fact, if we look at the genetic code,
it's the only disease we can see
that people who lived in Africa
actually evolved several things to avoid malarial deaths.
Deaths actually peaked at a bit over five million in the 1930s.
So it was absolutely gigantic.
And the disease was all over the world.
A terrible disease. It was in the United States. It was in Europe.
People didn't know what caused it until the early 1900s,
when a British military man figured out that it was mosquitos.
So it was everywhere.
And two tools helped bring the death rate down.
One was killing the mosquitos with DDT.
The other was treating the patients with quinine, or quinine derivatives.
And so that's why the death rate did come down.
it was eliminated from all the temperate zones,
which is where the rich countries are.
So we can see: 1900, it's everywhere.
1945, it's still most places.
1970, the U.S. and most of Europe have gotten rid of it.
1990, you've gotten most of the northern areas.
And more recently you can see it's just around the equator.
because the disease is only in the poorer countries,
it doesn't get much investment.
For example, there's more money put into baldness drugs
than are put into malaria.
Now, baldness, it's a terrible thing.
(Laughter)
And rich men are afflicted.
And so that's why that priority has been set.
even the million deaths a year caused by malaria
greatly understate its impact.
Over 200 million people at any one time are suffering from it.
It means that you can't get the economies in these areas going
because it just holds things back so much.
Now, malaria is of course transmitted by mosquitos.
I brought some here, just so you could experience this.
We'll let those roam around the auditorium a little bit.
(Laughter)
There's no reason only poor people should have the experience.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Those mosquitos are not infected.
And bed nets are a great tool.
What it means is the mother and child stay under the bed net at night,
so the mosquitos that bite late at night can't get at them.
And when you use indoor spraying with DDT
and those nets
you can cut deaths by over 50 percent.
And that's happened now in a number of countries.
It's great to see.
the parasite evolves and the mosquito evolves.
So every tool that we've ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective.
And so you end up with two choices.
If you go into a country with the right tools and the right way,
you do it vigorously,
you can actually get a local eradication.
And that's where we saw the malaria map shrinking.
Or, if you go in kind of half-heartedly,
for a period of time you'll reduce the disease burden,
but eventually those tools will become ineffective,
and the death rate will soar back up again.
And the world has gone through this where it paid attention and then didn't pay attention.
Bed net funding is up.
There's new drug discovery going on.
Our foundation has backed a vaccine that's going into phase three trial
that starts in a couple months.
And that should save over two thirds of the lives if it's effective.
So we're going to have these new tools.
Because the road map to get rid of this disease
involves many things.
It involves communicators to keep the funding high,
to keep the visibility high,
to tell the success stories.
It involves social scientists,
so we know how to get not just 70 percent of the people to use the bed nets,
but 90 percent.
We need mathematicians to come in and simulate this,
to do Monte Carlo things to understand how these tools combine and work together.
Of course we need drug companies to give us their expertise.
We need rich-world governments to be very generous in providing aid for these things.
And so as these elements come together,
I'm quite optimistic
that we will be able to eradicate malaria.
a fairly different question, but I'd say equally important.
And this is: How do you make a teacher great?
It seems like the kind of question that people would spend a lot of time on,
and we'd understand very well.
And the answer is, really, that we don't.
Let's start with why this is important.
Well, all of us here, I'll bet, had some great teachers.
We all had a wonderful education.
That's part of the reason we're here today,
part of the reason we're successful.
I can say that, even though I'm a college drop-out.
I had great teachers.
There are fairly effective teachers in a narrow set of places.
So the top 20 percent of students have gotten a good education.
And those top 20 percent have been the best in the world,
if you measure them against the other top 20 percent.
And they've gone on to create the revolutions in software and biotechnology
and keep the U.S. at the forefront.
is starting to fade on a relative basis,
but even more concerning is the education that the balance of people are getting.
Not only has that been weak. it's getting weaker.
And if you look at the economy, it really is only providing opportunities now
to people with a better education.
And we have to change this.
We have to change it so that people have equal opportunity.
We have to change it so that the country is strong
and stays at the forefront
of things that are driven by advanced education,
like science and mathematics.
I was pretty stunned at how bad things are.
Over 30 percent of kids never finish high school.
And that had been covered up for a long time
because they always took the dropout rate as the number
who started in senior year and compared it to the number who finished senior year.
Because they weren't tracking where the kids were before that.
But most of the dropouts had taken place before that.
They had to raise the stated dropout rate
as soon as that tracking was done
to over 30 percent.
For minority kids, it's over 50 percent.
And even if you graduate from high school,
if you're low-income,
you have less than a 25 percent chance of ever completing a college degree.
If you're low-income in the United States,
you have a higher chance of going to jail
than you do of getting a four-year degree.
And that doesn't seem entirely fair.
There's many people working on it.
We've worked on small schools,
we've funded scholarships,
we've done things in libraries.
A lot of these things had a good effect.
But the more we looked at it, the more we realized that having great teachers
was the very key thing.
And we hooked up with some people studying
how much variation is there between teachers,
between, say, the top quartile -- the very best --
and the bottom quartile.
How much variation is there within a school or between schools?
And the answer is that these variations are absolutely unbelievable.
A top quartile teacher will increase the performance of their class --
based on test scores --
by over 10 percent in a single year.
What does that mean?
That means that if the entire U.S., for two years,
had top quartile teachers,
the entire difference between us and Asia would go away.
Within four years we would be blowing everyone in the world away.
And so you'd say, "Wow, we should reward those people.
We should retain those people.
We should find out what they're doing and transfer that skill to other people."
But I can tell you that absolutely is not happening today.
What do they look like?
You might think these must be very senior teachers.
And the answer is no.
Once somebody has taught for three years
their teaching quality does not change thereafter.
The variation is very, very small.
You might think these are people with master's degrees.
They've gone back and they've gotten their Master's of Education.
This chart takes four different factors
and says how much do they explain teaching quality.
That bottom thing, which says there's no effect at all,
is a master's degree.
One is seniority.
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension.
The second is giving extra money to people who get their master's degree.
But it in no way is associated with being a better teacher.
Teach for America: slight effect.
For math teachers majoring in math there's a measurable effect.
But, overwhelmingly, it's your past performance.
There are some people who are very good at this.
And we've done almost nothing
to study what that is
and to draw it in and to replicate it,
to raise the average capability --
or to encourage the people with it to stay in the system.
The answer is, on average, the slightly better teachers leave the system.
And it's a system with very high turnover.
A good example of one is a set of charter schools called KIPP.
KIPP means Knowledge Is Power.
It's an unbelievable thing.
They have 66 schools -- mostly middle schools, some high schools --
and what goes on is great teaching.
They take the poorest kids,
and over 96 percent of their high school graduates go to four-year colleges.
And the whole spirit and attitude in those schools
is very different than in the normal public schools.
They're team teaching. They're constantly improving their teachers.
They're taking data, the test scores,
and saying to a teacher, "Hey, you caused this amount of increase."
They're deeply engaged in making teaching better.
at first it's very bizarre.
I sat down and I thought, "What is going on?"
The teacher was running around, and the energy level was high.
I thought, "I'm in the sports rally or something.
What's going on?"
And the teacher was constantly scanning to see which kids weren't paying attention,
which kids were bored,
and calling kids rapidly, putting things up on the board.
It was a very dynamic environment,
because particularly in those middle school years -- fifth through eighth grade --
keeping people engaged and setting the tone
that everybody in the classroom needs to pay attention,
nobody gets to make fun of it or have the position of the kid who doesn't want to be there.
Everybody needs to be involved.
And so KIPP is doing it.
Well, in a normal school, teachers aren't told how good they are.
The data isn't gathered.
In the teacher's contract,
it will limit the number of times the principal can come into the classroom --
sometimes to once per year.
And they need advanced notice to do that.
So imagine running a factory where you've got these workers,
some of them just making crap
and the management is told, "Hey, you can only come down here once a year,
but you need to let us know, because we might actually fool you,
and try and do a good job in that one brief moment."
They don't have the test scores,
and there's a whole thing of trying to block the data.
For example, New York passed a law
that said that the teacher improvement data could not be made available and used
in the tenure decision for the teachers.
And so that's sort of working in the opposite direction.
But I'm optimistic about this,
I think there are some clear things we can do.
and that's given us the picture of where we are.
And that allows us to understand who's doing it well,
and call them out, and find out what those techniques are.
Of course, digital video is cheap now.
Putting a few cameras in the classroom
and saying that things are being recorded on an ongoing basis
is very practical in all public schools.
And so every few weeks teachers could sit down
and say, "OK, here's a little clip of something I thought I did well.
Here's a little clip of something I think I did poorly.
Advise me -- when this kid acted up, how should I have dealt with that?"
And they could all sit and work together on those problems.
You can take the very best teachers and kind of annotate it,
have it so everyone sees who is the very best at teaching this stuff.
so that a kid could go out and watch the physics course, learn from that.
If you have a kid who's behind,
you would know you could assign them that video to watch and review the concept.
And in fact, these free courses could not only be available just on the Internet,
but you could make it so that DVDs were always available,
and so anybody who has access to a DVD player can have the very best teachers.
And so by thinking of this as a personnel system,
we can do it much better.
the place that this is going on --
that Jay Matthews, a news reporter, wrote -- called, "Work Hard, Be Nice."
And I thought it was so fantastic.
It gave you a sense of what a good teacher does.
I'm going to send everyone here a free copy of this book.
(Applause)
and I really think that education is the most important thing to get right
for the country to have as strong a future as it should have.
In fact we have in the stimulus bill -- it's interesting --
the House version actually had money in it for these data systems,
and it was taken out in the Senate
because there are people who are threatened by these things.
I think people are beginning to recognize how important this is,
and it really can make a difference for millions of lives, if we get it right.
I only had time to frame those two problems.
There's a lot more problems like that --
AIDS, pneumonia -- I can just see you're getting excited,
just at the very name of these things.
And the skill sets required to tackle these things are very broad.
You know, the system doesn't naturally make it happen.
Governments don't naturally pick these things in the right way.
The private sector doesn't naturally put its resources into these things.
to study these things, get other people involved --
and you're helping to come up with solutions.
And with that, I think there's some great things that will come out of it.
(Applause)
Many of you could ask the question, you know,
why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,
a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?
A number of years ago,
Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars
of some form would be available.
When I was about five years old,
not very much -- about a year after
Mr. Ford made his predictions,
I was living in a rural part of Canada,
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,
through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.
It was a trying and scary thing
for a young kid to be going through.
I discovered a couple hummingbirds
that were caught in a shed near my home.
They'd worn themselves out,
beating themselves against the window,
and, well, they were easy to capture.
and I was very inspired by that.
with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,
what the hummingbird does,
and give you that flexibility.
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,
after the Latin word "volant," meaning,
to fly in a light, nimble manner.
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.
The FAA, the controlling body above all,
calls it a "powered lift aircraft."
And they've actually issued a pilot's license --
It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that
there are no operational powered lift aircraft.
This is a little bit earlier version of it,
that's why it's given the X designation,
but it's a four-passenger aircraft
that could take off vertically, like a helicopter --
therefore it doesn't need an airfield.
On the ground, it's powered electrically.
because of the three wheels, which is a great asset
does pretty much what the hummingbird does,
and gets around in much the same way, and it's true,
but a helicopter is a very complex device.
It's expensive --
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,
in my case the Skycar volantor --
is the experience that I've had
in flying both of those.
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation --
you feel like you're being hauled up from above
by a vibrating crane.
When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you,
without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.
And it's been a great motivator.
I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,
but it's still one of those wonderful experiences
that reward you for all that time.
Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips
make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.
If we can get rid of that,
then the highways will now be useful to you,
as contrasted by what's happening
of what we really have seen in infrastructure,
because whether I give you a perfect Skycar,
the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you
unless you've got a system to use it in.
I'm sure any of you have asked the question,
And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.
The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.
But we have to have these priority changes,
we have to have infrastructure to go with this.
Historically you see that we got around
200 years ago by canals,
and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.
As that disappeared we came in with highways.
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system --
and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways
in the next 10 years.
And where is that going to lead you to?
So the issue then, I've often asked, is
when is it going to happen?
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.
I'd prefer to quote someone else,
who testified with me before Congress,
and in his position as head of NASA
put forward this particular vision
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,
you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour --
on average, according to the DOT --
the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,
up to 25,000 feet.
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase
in the ability to get around
as far as speed is concerned.
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,
but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,
there's a Russian GPS,
and there's a new GPS system
going to Europe, called Galileo.
With those three systems,
you have what is always necessary --
a level of redundancy that says,
if one system fails, you'll still have a way
to make sure that you're being controlled.
Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,
it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.
take off from your home because it's too noisy.
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.
But it's still fairly quiet.
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,
which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,
and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.
After all, if you can fly like that,
why are you going to drive around on a highway?
Go to a local vertiport,
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.
I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,
and I got a lot of excitement around this,
and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.
And then through the various years
we invented various vehicles.
Actually the critical point was in 1989,
when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle --
how completely stable it was in all circumstances,
which is of course very critical.
Still not a practical vehicle during all of this,
but moving in the right direction, we believe.
or actually the middle of 2002,
we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.
In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.
And we had very small power plants in it at this time.
We are now installing larger powerplants,
which will make it possible for me to get back on board.
There's an old adage that applied for the years
between 1950s and 1970s,
when every aeronautical company
A vertical-takeoff aircraft
needs an artificial stabilization system --
that's essential.
At least for the hover,
If that single-stability system,
that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,
that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.
And the adage that I'm referring to,
that applied at that time,
was that nothing comes down faster
than a VTOL aircraft upside down.
more or less for a number of years.
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today
A vertical-takeoff aircraft,
like the hummingbird,
A very unique engine -- it's round,
it's small, it's vibration-free.
It fits exactly where we need to fit it,
for those who are into the automobile --
know that it recently is applied to the RX8 --
the Mazda.
Wonderful engine.
In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,
which is twice as good as your car engine today,
but only half of what we need.
My company has spent 35 years
and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,
We actually get 175 horsepower
We have eight engines in this vehicle.
We have four computers. We have two parachutes.
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system --
if one computer is not agreeing with the other three,
it's kicked out of the system.
And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.
If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.
If you stick around, then good luck.
The parachutes are there -- hopefully,
more for psychological than real reasons, but
of the Skycar's use,
but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.
You could think of it personally in your own terms,
of how you might use it.
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation
in something like the Skycar,
probably in another volantor form as well,
will be a significant part of our lives,
as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.
If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,
you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,
buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,
buy a Skycar,
which I think would be priced at that time perhaps
in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...
And that has --
you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,
and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.
I characterized this emerging technology
in an aphorism,
"Are you in the market for a volantor?"
Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.
that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.
to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.
That we need an alternative to the automobile,
I'm going to talk about a very fundamental change that is going on
in the very fabric of the modern economy.
And to talk about that, I'm going to go back to the beginning,
because in the beginning were commodities.
Commodities are things that you grow in the ground, raise on the ground or pull out of the ground:
basically, animal, mineral, vegetable.
And then you extract them out of the ground,
and sell them on the open marketplace.
Commodities were the basis of the agrarian economy
that lasted for millennia.
But then along came the industrial revolution,
and then goods became the predominant economic offering,
where we used commodities as a raw material
to be able to make or manufacture goods.
Well, what then happened over the last 50 or 60 years,
is that goods have become commoditized.
Commoditized: where they're treated like a commodity,
where people don't care who makes them.
They just care about three things and three things only:
price, price and price.
and that is customization.
My first book was called "Mass Customization" --
it came up a couple of times yesterday --
and how I discovered this progression of economic value
was realizing that customizing a good
automatically turned it into a service,
because it was done just for a particular person,
because it wasn't inventoried,
it was delivered on demand to that individual person.
But over the past 10 or 20 years, what's happened is that
services are being commoditized as well.
Long-distance telephone service sold on price, price, price;
fast-food restaurants with all their value pricing;
and even the Internet is commoditizing not just goods,
but services as well.
What that means is that it's time
to move to a new level of economic value.
Time to go beyond the goods and the services,
and use, in that same heuristic, what happens when you customize a service?
What happens when you design a service that is so appropriate for a particular person --
that's exactly what they need at this moment in time?
Then you can't help but make them go "wow";
you can't help but turn it into a memorable event --
you can't help but turn it into an experience.
where experiences are becoming the predominant economic offering.
Now most places that I talk to,
when I talk about experience, I talk about Disney --
the world's premier experience-stager.
I talk about theme restaurants, and experiential retail,
and boutique hotels, and Las Vegas --
the experience capital of the world.
But here, when you think about experiences,
think about Thomas Dolby and his group, playing music.
Think about meaningful places.
Think about drinking wine,
about a journey to the Clock of the Long Now.
Those are all experiences. Think about TED itself.
The experience capital in the world of conferences.
All of these are experiences.
and particularly in the Netherlands,
and whenever I talk about the experience economy there,
I'm always greeted at the end with one particular question,
almost invariably.
And the question isn't really so much a question
as an accusation.
And the Dutch, when they usually put it,
it always starts with the same two words.
You know the words I mean?
You Americans.
They say, you Americans.
You like your fantasy environments,
your fake, your Disneyland experiences.
They say, we Dutch, we like real,
natural, authentic experiences.
So much has that happened that I've developed a fairly praticed response,
which is: I point out that first of all,
you have to understand that there is no such thing
as an inauthentic experience.
Why? Because the experience happens inside of us.
It's our reaction to the events that are staged in front of us.
So, as long as we are in any sense authentic human beings,
then every experience we have is authentic.
Now, there may be more or less natural or artificial
stimuli for the experience,
but even that is a matter of degree, not kind.
And there's no such thing as a 100 percent natural experience.
Even if you go for a walk in the proverbial woods,
there is a company that manufactured the car
that delivered you to the edge of the woods;
there's a company that manufactured the shoes that you have
to protect yourself from the ground of the woods.
There's a company that provides a cell phone service you have
in case you get lost in the woods.
Right? All of those are man-made,
artificiality brought into the woods by you,
and by the very nature of being there.
by talking about -- the thing that amazes me the most about this question,
particularly coming from the Dutch,
is that the Netherlands
is every bit as manufactured as Disneyland.
(Laughter)
And the Dutch, they always go ...
and they realize, I'm right!
There isn't a square meter of ground in the entire country
that hasn't been reclaimed from the sea,
or otherwise moved, modified and manicured
to look as if it had always been there.
It's the only place you ever go for a walk in the woods and all the trees are lined up in rows.
(Laughter)
but everyone has this desire for the authentic.
And authenticity is therefore
becoming the new consumer sensibility --
the buying criteria by which consumers
are choosing who are they going to buy from,
and what they're going to buy.
Becoming the basis of the economy.
In fact, you can look at how each of these economies developed,
that each one has their own business imperative,
matched with a consumer sensibility.
We're the agrarian economy, and we're supplying commodities.
It's about supply and availability.
Getting the commodities to market.
getting the costs down as low as possible
so we can offer them to the masses.
With the service economy, it is about
improving quality.
That has -- the whole quality movement has risen
with the service economy over the past 20 or 30 years.
it's about rendering authenticity.
Rendering authenticity -- and the keyword is "rendering."
Right? Rendering, because you have to get your consumers --
as business people --
to percieve your offerings as authentic.
Because there is a basic paradox:
no one can have an inauthentic experience,
but no business can supply one.
Because all businesses are man-made objects; all business is involved with money;
all business is a matter of using machinery,
and all those things make something inauthentic.
So, how do you render authenticity,
is the question.
Are you rendering authenticity?
what Lionel Trilling, in his seminal book on authenticity,
"Sincerity and Authenticity" -- came out in 1960 --
points to as the seminal point
at which authenticity entered the lexicon,
if you will.
And that is, to no surprise, in Shakespeare,
and in his play, Hamlet.
And there is one part in this play, Hamlet,
where the most fake of all the characters in Hamlet, Polonius,
says something profoundly real.
At the end of a laundry list of advice
he's giving to his son, Laertes,
he says this:
And this above all: to thine own self be true.
And it doth follow, as night the day,
that thou canst not then be false to any man.
And those three verses are the core of authenticity.
There are two dimensions to authenticity:
one, being true to yourself, which is very self-directed.
Two, is other-directed:
being what you say you are to others.
And I don't know about you, but whenever I encounter two dimensions,
I immediately go, ahh, two-by-two!
All right? Anybody else like that, no?
Well, if you think about that, you do, in fact, get
a two-by-two.
Where, on one dimension it's a matter of being true to yourself.
As businesses, are the economic offerings you are providing --
are they true to themselves?
And the other dimension is:
are they what they say they are to others?
If not, you have,
"is not true to itself," and "is not what it says it is,"
yielding a two-by-two matrix.
And of course, if you are both true to yourself,
and are what you say you are, then you're real real!
(Laughter)
All right, now, there is value for fake.
There will always be companies around to supply the fake,
because there will always be desire for the fake.
Fact is, there's a general rule: if you don't like it, it's fake;
if you do like it, it's faux.
(Laughter)
being a real fake --
is what it says it is,
but is not true to itself,
or being a fake real:
is true to itself, but not what it says it is.
You can think about those two -- you know, both of these
better than being fake fake -- not quite as good as being real real.
You can contrast them by thinking about
Universal City Walk versus
Disney World, or Disneyland.
Universal City Walk is a real fake --
in fact, we got this very term
from Ada Louise Huxtable's book, "The Unreal America."
A wonderful book, where she talks about Universal City Walk as --
you know, she decries the fake, but she says, at least that's a real fake,
right, because you can see behind the facade, right?
It is what it says it is: It's Universal Studio;
it's in the city of Los Angeles; you're going to walk a lot.
Right? You don't tend to walk a lot in Los Angeles,
well, here's a place where you are going to walk a lot,
outside in this city.
But is it really true to itself?
Right? Is it really in the city?
Is it --
you can see behind all of it,
and see what is going on in the facades of it.
So she calls it a real fake.
or a fake reality.
Right? It's not what it says it is. It's not really the magic kingdom.
(Laughter)
But it is -- oh, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to --
(Laughter)
-- sorry.
We won't talk about Santa Claus then.
(Laughter)
But Disney World is wonderfully true to itself.
Right? Just wonderfully true to itself.
When you are there you are just immersed
in this wonderful environment.
So, it's a fake real.
to fall down in this,
and not be real real,
right, the easiest way not to be true to yourself
is not to understand your heritage,
and thereby repudiate that heritage.
Right, the key of being true to yourself is knowing who you are as a business.
Knowing where your heritage is: what you have done in the past.
And what you have done in the past limits what you can do,
what you can get away with, essentially, in the future.
So, you have to understand that past.
Disney,
10 or 15 years ago, right,
the Disney -- the company that is probably
best-known for family values out there,
Disney bought the ABC network.
The ABC network, affectionately known in the trade
as the T&A network, right --
that's not too much jargon, is it?
Right, the T&A network. Then it bought Miramax,
known for its NC-17 fare,
and all of a sudden, families everywhere
couldn't really trust what they were getting from Disney.
It was no longer true to its heritage;
no longer true to Walt Disney.
That's one of the reasons why they're having such trouble today,
and why Roy Disney is out to get Michael Eisner.
Because it is no longer true to itself.
So, understand what -- your past limits what you can do in the future.
is that they advertise
things that they are not.
That's when you're perceived as fake, as a phony company --
advertizing things that you're not.
Think about any hotel, any airline,
any hospital.
Right, if you could check into the ads, you'd have a great experience.
(Laughter)
But unfortunately, you have to experience the actual hotel,
airline and hospital, and then you have that disconnect.
Then you have that perception that you are phony.
So, the number one thing to do when it comes to being what you say you are,
is to provide places for people to experience
who you are.
For people to experience who you are.
Right, it's not advertising does it.
right, that doesn't advertise at all.
They said, you want to know who we are, you have to come experience us.
And think about the economic value they have provided
by that experience.
Right? Coffee, at its core, is what?
Right? It's beans; right? It's coffee beans.
You know how much coffee is worth, when treated as a commodity as a bean?
Two or three cents per cup -- that's what coffee is worth.
But grind it, roast it, package it, put it on a grocery store shelf,
and now it'll cost five, 10, 15 cents,
when you treat it as a good.
Take that same good,
and perform the service of actually brewing it for a customer,
in a corner diner, in a bodega, a kiosk somewhere,
you get 50 cents, maybe a buck
per cup of coffee.
But surround the brewing of that coffee
with the ambiance of a Starbucks,
with the authentic cedar that goes inside of there,
and now, because of that authentic experience,
you can charge two, three, four, five dollars
for a cup of coffee.
So, authenticity is becoming
the new consumer sensibility.
with three rules, three basic rules.
One, don't say you're authentic
unless you really are authentic.
Two, it's easier to be authentic
if you don't say you're authentic.
And three, if you say you're authentic,
you better be authentic.
And then for the consumers, for everyone else in the audience,
let me simply summarize it by saying, increasingly,
what we -- what will make us happy,
is spending our time and our money
satisfying the desire for authenticity.
Thank you.
I'll just start talking about the 17th century.
And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf.
And I started living down there on the beach for a long time.
for waves,
when you're waiting for a wave to come in.
You know, they get a real bad rap in the world.
People think they're sort of lowbrows.
it was called "The Air Pump,"
was just the only natural way to think about things.
and I had always been like a little scientist guy.
And when I went to find out something,
you know, when they first told me how --
how you were supposed to do science,
But it didn't -- it never occurred to me
that it had to be invented
and that it had been invented
only 350 years ago.
You know, it was --
like it happened in England, and Germany, and Italy
sort of all at the same time.
And the story of that,
I thought, was really fascinating.
So I'm going to talk a little bit about that,
You know, Charles I got beheaded
somewhere early in the 17th century.
And the English set up Cromwell
and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever,
They changed the government, and it didn't work.
And
this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,
but people in the 17th century in England
were starting to talk about, you know,
philosophy and stuff in bars.
They didn't have TV screens,
and they didn't have any football games to watch.
about issues like whether or not
it was okay if Robert Boyle
He was a Christian guy during the weekends,
they didn't really understand the same way we do
about you know, this stuff is
a bunch of different kinds of molecules,
and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that.
I mean, fish don't know much about water,
One thing, he put a bird in there, and he pumped all the air out,
and the bird died. So he said, hmm...
Aristotle said that nature abhors one.
I mean, whatever that is that kills the bird --
and I'm calling it a vacuum.
And the religious people said that
I mean, God is everywhere,
when you suck everything out of a compartment.
like a fan, that was
He had another fan opposed to it
that he had like a --
I know exactly how he did it; I've seen the drawings.
after he got the vacuum established,
and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it,
And Charles
started not liking that.
let's make a place where you can do this stuff
and science and stuff like that,
Charles said, I'm going to put up the money
give you guys a building,
He said, OK, we're going to start having these meetings.
And anybody who wants to do science is --
And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society,
they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well.
And so, they would come in and you would do --
Anybody that was going to show an experiment,
demonstrate some principle,
You're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything.
here's what we do, and then here's what happens.
and say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime
we make one of these things.
is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing.
Candles can't burn in a vacuum,
but they didn't know that.
They didn't have sparklers. But, they --
only to the things that you've been able to demonstrate.
And most the demonstrations had to do with visuals.
Like if you do an experiment on stage,
and nobody can see it, they can just hear it, they would probably think you were freaky.
But the general idea that you could only --
because you weren't going to be talking final causes.
What's happening here,
in the middle of the 17th century,
was that what became my field --
and it was in a physical way, because we're going to do it in this room over here,
But experimental science had been tied up with all those things.
And the mathematics part
And -- things --
we never looked back.
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled a thing that was really impeding
technology from being developed.
Remember, that's a short time.
that most of us, the ancestors of most of us in this room
But that happened very -- a long time ago
compared to
350 short years ago.
But in that 350 years,
the place has just undergone a lot of changes.
some of you, I know, didn't pick up your bags --
but if you picked up your bag, everybody in this room
that 350 years ago,
I just had a natural feeling for science
You know, I was one of those scientists that was --
(Laughter)
so much as just a lively discussion.
I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,
until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century,
I, like, for instance, I had this --
that would like, make a rocket, like,
I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute
to come back with the frog in it.
it said in there
You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can
get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,
from an upstairs window,
where she would be ironing or something like that.
I may not care about the fact
So, I went to the drug store
and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate
and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid
to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.
Nowadays, it's no ma'am,
check your shoes. And like --
(Laughter)
But then it wasn't -- they didn't have any, but the guy had --
I said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know.
And he had potassium nitrate.
Just to see what would happen, if you mixed it together.
And then I tried the melting business, and I melted it.
And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid, brown.
And then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance,
that when you lit that,
it went off like a bat.
to finally figure out all the little things.
And then you slowly build up a theory
of how this stuff works.
And it was -- I was following all the rules.
I didn't know what the rules were,
I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,
or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century, whatever.
and get him back alive.
And we had not --
and it made a lot of noise,
and it was powerful, you know.
And once in a while, they would blow up.
the explosion causing the destruction of the planet.
I could have thought,
I'd better not do this because
they say not to, you know.
At any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story,
So, so I've got something else that's not personal.
and then instead of, like, looking up,
I -- sometimes you do that,
if you're going to write a paper later,
you want to figure out who else has worked on it.
and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA,
you know, the thinking for that
was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car,
that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.
Nobody wants a chemist to come in
you don't always get the right answer, see.
But I knew, you'd go into the lab
because right there in that tube
and here, on this gel, there's a little band there
I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble,
if I, like -- so I've just sort of been naturally honest
and naturally inquisitive,
and that sort of leads to that kind of science.
Now, let's see...
I've got another five minutes, right?
OK. All scientists aren't like that.
Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.
and do ridiculous things with test tube.
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with.
You know, they made drugs to give the pilots
if they were broken up in the process.
They made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb
to end the whole thing, right?
And everybody stepped back a little and said, you know,
we ought to invest in this shit,
because whoever has got the most of these people
working in the places is going to have a dominant position,
at least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.
And they weren't the curious little boys
that liked to put frogs up in the air.
They were the same people that later went in to medical school, you know,
because there was money in it, you know. I mean, later, then they all got into business --
I mean, there are waves of -- going into your high school,
person saying, you want to be rich, you know, be a scientist. You know, not anymore.
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.
they don't --
they don't always tell you the truth, you know.
There is nothing in their contract, in fact,
And the people I'm talking about are people that like --
they say that they're a member of the committee
called, say, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.
And they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out
when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.
longer than that it's been measured,
and in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.
It's like, the average temperature
has gone up a tiny little bit,
where the airport was, and now
the town's moved out there, there's concrete all around
and they call it the skyline effect.
It should have been. But not a lot. Not like, you know --
actually, he didn't think of it that way.
His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish, and he said,
if you double the CO2 level in the atmosphere,
the temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.
with no stuff in it, really,
but a lot of other people later on
started thinking it would be bad, you know.
I mean, the temperature as measured --
and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just --
So -- and Arrhenius' theory --
and all the global warmers think --
but people don't like things like this, so -- most -- I mean,
It's a paper that came out in February,
and most of you probably hadn't heard about it.
Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA,
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine,
February the first,
and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers,
and in also the Science editor's, like,
descriptions of these papers, for, you know,
for the quickie,
They say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up --
from satellites, and it isn't going up.
And in this paper, they show something much more striking,
and that was that they did what they call a radiation --
and I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated,
but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is
it falls on the earth, the earth gives back a certain amount.
When it gets warm it generates --
it makes redder energy -- I mean, like infra-red,
like something that's warm gives off infra-red.
which is where it's centered -- that goes right through CO2.
and you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it,
but these -- they actually measured it,
and it turns out that in the last 10 years --
of what they call "imbalance"
has been way the hell over what was expected.
But if we did, in 2025 or something,
have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,
they say it would be increase the energy budget
Well, they found out in this study -- these two studies
by two different teams --
had been coming in from 1998, 1999,
"The End to the Global Warming Fiasco," you know.
They're concerned,
and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers,
and by scared people.
You know, if they said, you know what?
I'll stand up too, and --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
They have to say that.
They had to be very cautious.
But what I'm saying is, you can be delighted,
because the editor of Science, who is no dummy,
and in the bottom lines in their papers
that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor.
It's not by a small one. They just --
they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth --
there's obviously some mechanisms going on
that nobody knew about,
because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know,
it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful,
And there's a lot of things like global warming,
and ozone hole and you know,
a whole bunch of scientific public issues,
that if you're interested in them,
then you have to get down the details, and read the papers called,
you'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things.
This is a wheat bread, a whole wheat bread,
and it's made with a new technique
that I've been playing around with,
and developing and writing about which, for lack of a better name,
we call the epoxy method.
And I call it an epoxy method because --
it's not very appetizing. I understand that --
but -- but
if you think about epoxy, what's epoxy?
It's two resins that are, sort of,
in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue,
but when you put the two together,
something happens. A bond takes place,
and you get this very strong, powerful
adhesive.
Well, in this technique,
what I've tried to do is kind of
gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world,
the artisan bread-baking community,
has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so --
since we've been engaged in a bread renaissance in America --
and put it together to come up with a method
that would help to take whole-grain breads.
And let's face it, everyone's trying to move towards whole grains.
We finally, after 40 years of knowing
that wholegrain was a healthier option,
we're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over
and attempting to actually eat them.
you know, how do you make it taste good?
Because whole grain -- it's easy with white flour
to make a good-tasting bread. White flour is sweet.
It's mainly starch, and starch, when you break it down --
what is starch? It's -- thank you -- sugar, yes.
So a baker, and a good baker,
knows how to pull or draw forth
the inherent sugar trapped in the starch.
With whole grain bread, you have other obstacles.
You've got bran, which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us,
or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber,
for the bran is fiber.
It's got germ. Those are the good things,
but those aren't the tastiest parts of the wheat.
So whole grain breads historically
have had sort of this onus of being health food breads,
and people don't like to eat,
quote, health food. They like to eat healthy and healthily,
but when we think of something as a health food,
we think of it as something we eat out of obligation,
not out of passion and love for the flavor.
the challenge of every culinary student, of every chef,
is to deliver flavor.
Flavor is king. Flavor rules.
I call it the flavor rule. Flavor rules.
And -- and
you can get somebody to eat something that's good for them once,
but they won't eat it again if they don't like it, right?
So, this is the challenge for this bread.
We're going to try this at lunch, and
I'll explain a bit more about it,
but it's made not only with two types of pre-doughs --
this attempt, again, at bringing out flavor
is to make a piece of dough
the day before that is not leavened.
It's just dough that is wet.
It's hydrated dough we call "the soaker" --
that helps to start enzyme activity.
And enzymes are the secret, kind of, ingredient in dough
that brings out flavor.
It starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch.
That's what enzymes are doing.
And so, if we can release some of those,
they become accessible to us in our palate.
They become accessible to the yeast as food.
They become accessible to the oven for caramelization
to give us a beautiful crust.
that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment.
And it's made -- it can be a sourdough starter, or what we call a "biga"
or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it,
and that starts to develop flavor also.
And on day two, we put those two pieces together. That's the epoxy.
And we're hoping that, sort of, the
enzyme piece of dough
becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough,
and when we put them together and add the final ingredients,
we can create a bread that does evoke
the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain.
That's the challenge. Okay, so, now, what we --
in the journey of wheat, let's go back and look at these 12 stages.
Okay, we're going to start with the first stage.
And this is what every student has to begin with.
Everyone who works in the culinary world knows that
the first stage of cooking is "mise en place,"
which is just a French way of saying, "get organized."
Everything in its place. First stage.
So in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients.
Stage two is mixing. We take the ingredients and we mix them.
We have to develop the gluten.
There's no gluten in flour. There's only the potential for gluten.
Here's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy
because we've got glutenin and gliadin,
neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread.
But when they get hydrated and they bond to each other,
they create a stronger molecule, a stronger protein we call gluten.
And so we, in the mixing process,
have to develop the gluten,
we have to activate the leaven or the yeast,
and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly.
which is really where the flavor develops.
The yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars,
creating carbon dioxide and alcohol --
essentially it's burping and sweating, which is what bread is.
It's yeast burps and sweat.
And somehow, this is transformed --
the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed --
and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special
is that it is a transformational food,
and we're going to explore that in a minute.
But then, quickly through the next few stages.
We, after it's fermented and it's developed,
started to develop flavor and character,
we divide it into smaller units.
And then we take those units and we shape them. We give them a little pre-shape,
usually a round or a little torpedo shape, sometimes.
That's called "rounding."
It can be for 20 or 30 minutes. We call that resting or benching.
Then we go into final shaping,
"panning" -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan.
This takes a second, but it's a distinctive stage.
It can be in a basket. It can be in a loaf pan, but we pan it.
And then, stage nine.
The fermentation which started at stage three is continuing
through all these other stages. Again, developing more flavor.
The final fermentation takes place in stage nine.
We call it "proofing."
Proofing means to prove that the dough is alive.
And at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape,
and it goes into the oven -- stage 10.
Three transformations take place in the oven.
The sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust.
They give us that beautiful brown crust.
Only the crust can caramelize. It's the only place that gets hot enough.
Inside, the proteins --
this gluten -- coagulates.
When it gets to about 160 degrees,
the proteins all line up and they create structure,
the gluten structure --
what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread.
And the starches, when they reach about 180 degrees,
gelatinize.
oven transformation.
Coagulation, caramelization and gelatinization --
when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that's around them,
they -- they kind of swell, and then they burst.
And they burst, and they spill their guts into the bread.
So basically now we're eating yeast sweats --
sweat, burps and starch guts.
Again, transformed in stage 10 in the oven
because what went into the oven as dough
comes out in stage 11 as bread.
And stage 11, we call it cooling --
because we never really eat the bread right away.
There's a little carry-over baking.
The proteins have to set up, strengthen and firm up.
And then we have stage 12, which the textbooks call "packaging,"
but my students call "eating."
And so, we're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat,
and in a few minutes we will try this,
and see if we have succeeded
in fulfilling this baker's mission of pulling out flavor.
and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation,
because I really believe that
all things can be understood --
and this is not my own idea. This goes back to the Scholastics and to the Ancients --
that all things can be understood on four levels:
the literal, the metaphoric or poetic level,
the political or ethical level.
And ultimately, the mystical or sometimes called the "anagogical" level.
It's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal.
In fact, Dante says you can't understand the three deeper levels
unless you first understand the literal level,
so that's why we're talking literally about bread.
But let's kind of look at these stages again
from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level --
all in my quest for answering the question,
"What is it about bread that's so special?"
And fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor.
bread begins as wheat or any other grain.
But what's wheat? Wheat is a grass
that grows in the field.
And, like all grasses, at a certain point it puts out seeds.
And we harvest those seeds, and those are the wheat kernels.
Now, in order to harvest it -- I mean, what's harvesting?
It's just a euphemism for killing, right?
I mean, that's what's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig, you know?
Yes, we slaughter, you know. Yes, that's life.
We harvest the wheat,
and in harvesting it, we kill it.
Now, wheat is alive,
and as we harvest it, it gives up its seeds.
Now, at least with seeds we have the potential for future life.
We can plant those in the ground.
And we save some of those for the next generation.
But most of those seeds get crushed
and turned into flour.
And at that point, the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity.
It's not only been killed,
but it's been denied any potential for creating future life.
So we turn it into flour.
The first transformation -- and, by the way,
the definition of transformation for me is
a radical change from one thing into something else.
O.K.? Radical, not subtle.
Not like hot water made cold,
or cold water turned hot,
but water boiled off and becoming steam.
That's a transformation, two different things.
Well, in this case, the first transformation
is alive to dead.
I'd call that radical.
So, we've got now this flour.
And what do we do? We add some water.
In stage one, we weigh it.
In stage two, we add water and salt to it, mix it together,
and we create something that we call "clay."
It's like clay.
And we infuse that clay
with an ingredient that we call "leaven."
In this case, it's yeast, but yeast is leaven. What does leaven mean?
Leaven comes from the root word that means enliven --
to vivify, to bring to life.
By the way, what's the Hebrew word for clay? Adam.
You see, the baker, in this moment,
has become, in a sense,
sort of, the God of his dough, you know, and his dough, well,
while it's not an intelligent life form, is now alive.
And we know it's alive because in stage three,
it grows. Growth is the proof of life.
literal transformations are taking place.
Enzymes are breaking forth sugars.
Yeast is eating sugar and
turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol.
Bacteria is in there, eating the same sugars,
turning them into acids.
In other words, personality and character's being developed in this dough
under the watchful gaze of the baker.
And the baker's choices all along the way
determine the outcome of the product.
A subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time --
it's all about a balancing act between time, temperature
and ingredients. That's the art of baking.
So all these things are determined by the baker,
and the bread goes through some stages, and characters develop.
And then we divide it, and this one big piece of dough
is divided into smaller units, and each of those units
are given shape by the baker.
And as they're shaped, they're raised again,
all along proving that they're alive,
and developing character.
It's still dough. Nobody eats bread dough --
a few people do, I think, but not too many.
I've met some dough eaters, but --
it's not the staff of life, right? Bread is the staff of life.
But dough is what we're working with,
and we take that dough to the oven,
and it goes into the oven. As soon as the interior temperature of that dough
crosses the threshold of 140 degrees,
it passes what we call the "thermal death point."
Students love that TDP. They think it's the name of a video game.
But it's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there.
The yeast, whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough,
to enliven it, to vivify it,
in order to complete its mission,
which is also to turn this dough into bread,
has to give up its life.
So you see the symbolism at work? It's starting to come forth a little bit, you know.
It's starting to make sense to me --
what goes in is dough,
what comes out is bread --
or it goes in alive,
comes out dead.
Third transformation. First transformation, alive to dead.
Second transformation, dead brought back to life.
Third transformation, alive to dead --
but dough to bread.
a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly.
And it's what comes out of the oven
that is what we call the staff of life.
This is the product
that
everyone in the world eats, that is so difficult to give up.
It's so
deeply embedded in our psyches that
bread is used as a symbol for life.
It's used as a symbol for transformation.
And so, as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that,
again completing the life cycle,
you know, we have a chance to essentially ingest that --
it nurtures us, and we continue to carry on
and have opportunities to ponder
things like this.
So this is what I've learned from bread.
This is what bread has taught me in my journey.
And what we're going to attempt to do
with this bread here, again,
is to use, in addition to everything we talked about,
this bread we're going to call "spent grain bread"
because, as you know, bread-making is very similar to beer-making.
Beer is basically liquid bread,
or bread is solid beer.
And --
(Laughter)
they -- they're invented around the same time. I think beer came first.
And the Egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep
in the hot, Egyptian sun, and it turned into bread.
and what I did here is to try to, again,
evoke even more flavor from this grain,
was we've added into it the spent grain from beer-making.
And if you make this bread, you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer.
I like dark spent grain. Today we're using a light spent grain
that's actually from, like, some kind of a lager of some sort --
a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that's been toasted.
In other words, the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains
by using sprouting and malting and roasting.
We're going to take some of that, and put it into the bread.
So now we not only have a high-fiber bread,
but now fiber on top of fiber.
And so this is, again, hopefully
not only a healthy bread,
but a bread that you will enjoy.
So, if I, kind of, break this bread,
maybe we can share this now a little bit here.
We'll start a little piece here,
and I'm going to take a little piece here --
I think I'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch.
I'll leave you
with what I call the baker's blessing.
May your crust be crisp,
and your bread always rise.
Thank you.
I was listed on the online biography
that said I was a design missionary.
That's a bit lofty; I'm really more
of something like a street walker.
I spend a lot of time in urban areas
looking for design,
and studying design in the public sector.
I take about 5,000 photographs a year,
and I thought that I would edit from these,
and try to come up with some images
that might be appropriate and interesting to you.
And I used three criteria:
the first was, I thought I'd talk about
real design within reach,
design that's free, not design not quite within reach,
as we're fondly known by our competition and competitors,
but stuff that you can find on the streets, stuff that was free,
stuff that was available to all people,
and stuff that probably contains some other important messages.
A very common public design done in the '50s.
It's got a nice kind of flowing, organic form,
very consistent with the Brazilian culture --
I think good design adds to culture.
Wholly inconsistent with San Francisco or New York.
But I think these are my sort of information highways:
I live in much more of an analog world,
where pedestrian traffic and
interaction and diversity exchange,
and where I think the simple things under our feet
have a great amount of meaning to us.
I was a ceramic designer for about 10 years,
and just loved utilitarian form --
simple things that we use every day,
little compositions of color and surface on form.
This led me to starting a company called Design Within Reach,
a company dealing with simple forms,
making good designers available to us,
and also selling the personalities and character of the designers
as well, and it seems to have worked.
A couple of years into the process,
I spent a lot of time in Europe traveling around, looking for design.
I was there going into the design stores,
and mixing with our crowd of designers,
and I recognized that a whole lot of stuff
pretty much looked the same, and the effect of globalization
has had that in our community also.
We know a lot about what's going on with design around the world,
and it's getting increasingly more difficult
to find design that reflects a unique culture.
I was walking around on the streets of Amsterdam
and I recognized, you know, the big story
from Amsterdam isn't what's in the design stores,
it's what's out on the streets,
and maybe it's self-explanatory,
but a city that hasn't been taken over by modernism,
that's preserved its kind of architecture and character,
and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way
in which people get around and where pedestrian rights
are protected.
And I write a newsletter that goes out every week,
and I wrote an article about this, and it got such enormous response
that I realized that design, that common design,
that's in the public area means a lot to people,
and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog.
in Europe where I spend a lot of time looking for design,
like Basel, where Vitra is located, or in northern Italy --
all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles,
and where pedestrian areas -- and I came to the conclusion that perhaps
there was something about these important design centers
that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic,
and I'm sure the skeptic eye would say, no, the correlation there
is that there are universities and schools
where people can't afford cars,
but it did seem that in many of these areas
pedestrian traffic was protected.
You wouldn't look at this and call this a designer bike:
a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum.
But I began looking at design in a place like Amsterdam
and recognized, you know, the first job of design
is to serve a social purpose.
And so I look at this bike as not being a designer bike,
but being a very good example of design.
in the cities, looking at design
for common evidence of design
that really isn't under so much of a designer's signature.
I was in Buenos Aires very recently,
and I went to see this bridge by Santiago Calatrava.
He's a Spanish architect and designer.
And the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge --
I love bridges, metaphorically and symbolically and structurally --
and it was a bit of a disappointment,
because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it; it really wasn't in use.
And I recognized that oftentimes design,
when you're set up to see design,
it can be a bit of a letdown.
it was a kind of construction zone;
a lot of buildings were going up.
And, approaching a building from a distance, you don't see too much;
you get a little closer, and you arrive at a nice little composition
that might remind you of a Mondrian or a Diebenkorn or something.
But to me it was an example of
industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation
and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design.
And going a little closer, you get a different perspective.
I find these little vignettes,
these little accidental pieces of design,
to be refreshing.
They give me, I don't know,
a sense of correctness in the world
and some visual delight in the knowledge
that the building will probably never look as good
as this simple industrial scaffolding
that is there to serve.
horizontal, vertical elements, little decorative lines
going across, these magenta squiggles,
the workmen being reduced to decorative elements,
just a nice, kind of, breakup
of the urban place.
And, you know, that no longer exists.
You've captured it for a moment, and finding this little still life's
like listening to little songs or something:
it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure.
Antoine Predock designed
a wonderful ball stadium in San Diego
called Petco Park.
A terrific use of local materials,
but inside you could find some interior compositions.
Some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games;
I go and see design relationships.
Just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture,
and the way that the trees form vertical elements.
that is often on stop signs.
It takes your attention; it has a great amount of emotion;
it stares back at you the way that a figure might.
Just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in Italy.
Construction site in New York:
red having this kind of emotional power
that's almost an equivalent with the way in which --
cuteness of puppies and such.
Side street in Italy.
Red drew me into this little composition,
optimistic to me in the sense that maybe
the public service's mailbox,
door service, plumbing.
It looks as if these different public services
work together to create some nice little compositions.
In Italy, you know, almost everything, kind of, looks good.
Simple menus put on a board,
achieving, kind of, the sort of balance.
But I'm convinced that it's because
you're walking around the streets and seeing things.
Red can be comical: it can draw your attention
to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant
suffering from bad civic planning in Havana.
Color can animate simple blocks,
simple materials:
walking in New York, I'll stop.
A nice visual composition of symmetry.
Curves against sharp things.
It's a comment on the way in which we deal with
public seating in the city of New York.
I've come across some other just,
kind of, curious relationships
of bollards on the street that have different interpretations,
but -- these things amuse me.
Sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in San Francisco --
a trash can that's been left there for 18 months
creates a nice 45-degree angle
against these other relationships,
and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture.
So, there's this sort of silent hand of design at work
that I see in places that I go.
It's quite free of commercial clutter:
you don't see our logos and brands and names,
and therefore you're alert to things physically.
And this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone,
and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that.
And Cuba needs to be far more resourceful,
because of the blockades and things,
but a really wonderful playground.
In our area, in furnishings,
they're sort of way at the top.
The Dutch are good also, but the Italians are good.
And I came across this little street in Venice,
where the communist headquarters
were sharing a wall with this Catholic shrine.
And I realized that, you know, Italy is a place
where they can accept these different ideologies
and deal with diversity and not have the problem,
or they can choose to ignore them,
but these -- you don't have warring factions,
and I think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity
which has made Italy so innovative
and so tolerant.
The past and the present work quite well together in Italy also,
and I think that it's recognizable there,
and has an important effect on culture,
because their public spaces are protected,
their sidewalks are protected,
and you're actually able to confront these things
their fear of modernism and other such things.
And I use this -- this is, sort of,
what I consider to be urban spam.
I notice this stuff because I walk a lot,
but here, private industry is really kind of
making a mess of the public sector.
And as I look at it, I sort of say, you know,
the publications that report on problems in the urban area
also contribute to it,
and it's just my call to say to all of us,
public policy won't change this at all;
private industry has to work to take things like this seriously.
there's kind of some type of control
over what's happening in the environment is very evident,
even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals.
I walk to work every day or ride my scooter,
and I come down and park in this little spot.
And I came down one day,
and all the bikes were red.
Now, this is not going to impress you guys who Photoshop, and can do stuff,
but this was an actual moment
when I got off my bike,
and I looked and I thought, it's as if
all of my biker brethren
had kind of gotten together and conspired
to make a little statement.
And it reminded me that --
to keep in the present,
to look out for these kinds of things.
if maybe it's a yellow day in San Francisco, and we could all agree,
and create some installations.
But it also reminded me of the power
of pattern and repetition
to make an effect in our mind.
And I don't know if there's a stronger kind of effect
than pattern and the way it unites
kind of disparate elements.
I was at the art show in Miami in December,
and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art,
and amazed at the prices of art
and how expensive it is, but having a great time looking at it.
And I came outside, and the valets for this car service
had created, you know, quite a nice little collage
of these car keys,
and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags
that I had seen in Tokyo.
And I thought that if
pattern can unite these disparate elements,
it can do just about anything.
because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form.
I was in a small restaurant in Spain,
having lunch --
one of those nice days where
you had the place kind of to yourself,
and you have a glass of wine, and enjoying the local area
and the culture and the food
and the quiet, and feeling very lucky,
and a bus load of tourists arrived,
emptied out,
filled up the restaurant.
In a very short period of time,
completely changed the atmosphere
and character with loud voices and large bodies and such,
and we had to get up and leave;
it was just that uncomfortable.
And at that moment, the sun came out,
and through this perforated screen,
a pattern was cast over these bodies
and they kind of faded into the rear,
and we left the restaurant kind of
feeling O.K. about stuff.
has the capability of eradicating
some of the most evil
forces of society,
such as bad form in restaurants,
but quite seriously, it was a statement to me
that one thing that you do, sort of, see
is the aggressive nature
of the industrial world has produced --
kind of,
large masses of things,
and when you -- in monoculture,
and I think the preservation of diversity in culture
is something that's important to us.
coming back to this theme of sidewalks,
and I wanted to
say something here about -- I'm, kind of, optimistic, you know.
Post-Second World War,
the influence of the automobile
has really been devastating in a lot of our cities.
A lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots
in a sort of indiscriminate use.
A lot of the planning departments became subordinated
to the transportation department. It's as easy to rag on cars
as it is on Wal-Mart;
I'm not going to do that.
But they're real examples in urbanization
and the change that's occurred in the last number of years,
and the heightened sensitivity to the importance
of our urban environments as cultural centers.
I think that they are, that the statements that we make
in this public sector
are our contributions
to a larger whole.
to encounter diversity
and to mix with other people.
We go there for stimulation in art and all those other things.
But I think people have recognized
the sanctity of our urban areas.
A place like Chicago
has really reached kind of a level of international stature.
The U.S. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of
enlightened urban planning and renewal,
and I want to single out a place like Chicago,
where I look at some guy like Mayor Daley as a bit of a design hero
for being able to work through the
political processes and all that to improve an area.
You would expect a city like this to have
upgraded flower boxes
on Michigan Avenue where wealthy people shop,
but if you actually go along the street you find
the flower boxes change from street to street:
there's actual diversity in the plants.
And the idea that a city group can maintain
different types of foliage
is really quite exceptional.
and then there are your big-D design statements:
the Pritzker Pavilion done by Frank Gehry.
My measure of this as being an important bit of design
There are a lot of free concerts, for example,
that go on in this area;
it has a phenomenal acoustic system.
I work on the mayor's council in San Francisco,
on the International Design Council for Mayors,
and Chicago is looked at as the pinnacle,
and I really would like to salute Mayor Daley and the folks there.
I thought that I should include at least one
shot of technology for you guys.
This is also in Millennium Park in Chicago,
where the Spanish artist-designer Plensa
has created, kind of,
a digital readout in this park
that reflects back
the characters and personalities
of the people in this area.
And it's a welcoming area, I think, inclusive of diversity,
reflective of diversity, and I think
this marriage of both technology and art
in the public sector is an area where the U.S.
can really take a leadership role,
and Chicago is one example.
I'm kind of tired of talking about simplicity, actually,
so I thought I'd make my life more complex, as a serious play.
So, I'm going to, like, go through some slides
from way back when,
and walk through them to give you a sense of how I end up here.
this whole idea of a computer.
Who has a computer? Yeah.
O.K., so, everyone has a computer.
Even a mobile phone, it's a computer.
And -- anyone remember this workbook,
"Instant Activities for Your Apple" --
free poster in each book?
This was how computing began.
Don't forget: a computer came out; it had no software.
You'd buy that thing, you'd bring it home, you'd plug it in,
and it would do absolutely nothing at all.
So, you had to program it,
and there were great programming, like, tutorials, like this.
I mean, this was great.
It's, like, you know, Herbie the Apple II.
It's such a great way to --
I mean, they should make Java books like this,
and we've have no problem learning a program.
But this was a great, grand time of the computer,
when it was just a raw, raw, what is it? kind of an era.
this era coincided with my own childhood.
Who of you grew up in a family business,
suffered the torture? Yes, yes.
The torture was good. Wasn't it good torture?
It was just life-changing, you know. And so, in my life, you know, I was in the tofu;
it was a family business.
And my mother was a kind of a designer, also.
She'd make this kind of, like, wall of tofu cooking,
and it would confuse the customers,
because they all thought it was a restaurant.
A bad sort of branding thing, or whatever.
But, anyway, that's where I grew up,
in this little tofu factory in Seattle,
and it was kind of like this:
a small room where I kind of grew up. I'm big there in that picture.
Like back here, there's like, concrete block technology here,
and he would need the concrete blocks to press the tofu,
because tofu is actually kind of a liquidy type of thing,
and so you have to have heavy stuff
to push out the liquid and make it hard.
Tofu comes out in these big batches,
I can't tell you -- family business story: you'd understand this --
my father was the most sincere man possible.
He walked into a Safeway once on a rainy day,
slipped, broke his arm, rushed out:
he didn't want to inconvenience Safeway.
So, instead, you know, my father's, like, arm's broken
for two weeks in the store, and that week --
now, those two weeks were when my older brother and I
had to do everything.
And that was torture, real torture.
Because, you see, we'd seen my father
taking the big block of tofu and cutting it,
like, knife in, zap, zap, zap. We thought, wow.
So, the first time I did that, I went, like, whoa! Like this.
Bad blocks. But anyways,
the tofu to me was kind of my origin, basically.
And because working in a store was so hard,
I liked going to school; it was like heaven.
And I was really good at school.
as most of you who are creatives,
your parents all told you not to be creative, right?
So, same way, you know,
I was good at art and good at math, and my father says, he's --
John's good at math.
I went to MIT, did my math,
but I had this wonderful opportunity,
because computers had just become visual.
The Apple -- Macintosh just came out;
I had a Mac in hand when I went to MIT.
And it was a time when a guy who, kind of,
could cross the two sides --
it was a good time.
was on a direct copy of then-Aldus PageMaker.
I made a desktop publishing system way back when,
and that was, kind of, my first step into figuring out how to --
oh, these two sides are kind of fun to mix.
And the problem when you're younger --
for all you students out there --
is, your head gets kind of big really easy.
And when I was making icons, I was, like,
the icon master,
and I was, like, yeah, I'm really good at this, you know.
And then luckily, you know,
I had the fortune of going to something called a library,
and in the library I came upon this very book.
I found this book. It's called,
"Thoughts on Design," by a man named Paul Rand.
It's a little slim volume; I'm not sure if you've seen this.
It's a very nice little book. It's about this guy, Paul Rand,
who was one of the greatest graphic designers,
and also a great writer as well.
And when I saw this man's work,
I realized how bad I was at design,
or whatever I called it back then,
and I suddenly had a kind of career goal,
kind of in hot pursuit.
like chopstick wrappers, napkins, menus -- whatever I could get a handle on:
sort of wheel-and-deal, move up in the design world, whatever.
And isn't it that strange moment when you publish your design?
Remember that moment -- publishing your designs?
Remember that moment? It felt so good, didn't it?
So, I was published, you know,
so, wow, my design's in a book, you know?
After that, things kind of got strange,
and I got thinking about the computer,
because the computer to me always, kind of, bothered me.
I didn't quite get it. And Paul Rand
was a kind of crusty designer,
you know, a crusty designer, like a good -- kind of like a good French bread?
You know, he wrote in one of his books:
"A Yale student once said,
'I came here to learn how to design, not how to use a computer.'
Design schools take heed."
This is in the '80s,
in the great clash of computer/non-computer people.
A very difficult time, actually.
This is the first sort of play thing I did, my own serious play.
I built a working version of an Adobe Illustrator-ish thing.
It looks like Illustrator; it can, like, draw.
It was very hard to make this, actually.
It took a month to make this part.
And then I thought, what if I added this feature,
where I can say, this point,
you can fly like a bird. You're free, kind of thing.
So I could, sort of, change the kind of stability
with a little control there on the dial,
and I can sort of watch it flip around.
And this is in 1993.
And when my professors saw this, they were very upset at me.
They were saying, Why's it moving?
They were saying, Make it stop now.
Now, I was saying, Well, that's the whole point: it's moving.
And he says, Well, when's it going to stop?
And I said, Never.
And he said, Even worse. Stop it now.
I started studying this whole idea,
of like, what is this computer? It's a strange medium.
It's not like print. It's not like video.
It lasts forever. It's a very strange medium.
So, I went off with this,
and began to look for things even more.
This is actually bad: human experiments.
I would do these things where I'd have students become pens:
there's blue pen, red pen, green pen, black pen.
And someone sits down and draws a picture.
They're laughing because he said,
draw from the middle-right to the middle, and he kind of messed up.
See, humans don't know how to take orders;
the computer's so good at it.
This guy figured out how to get the computer to draw with two pens at once:
you know, you, pen, do this, and you, pen, do this.
And so began to have multiple pens on the page --
again, hard to do with our hands.
And then someone discovered this "a-ha moment"
where you could use coordinate systems.
We thought, ah, this is when it's going to happen.
In the end, he drew a house. It was the most boring thing.
It became computerish; we began to think computerish --
the X, Y system -- and so that was kind of a revelation.
called a human-powered computer.
So, this happened in 1993.
Sound down, please.
It's a computer where the people are the parts.
I have behind this wall a disk drive, a CPU,
a graphics card, a memory system.
They're picking up a giant floppy disk made of cardboard.
It's put inside the computer.
And that little program's on that cardboard disk.
So, she wears the disk,
and reads the data off the sectors of the disk,
and the computer starts up; it sort of boots up, really.
And it's a sort of a working computer. And when I built this computer,
I had a moment of -- what is it called? --
the epiphany where I realized that the computer's just so fast.
This computer appears to be fast - she's working pretty hard,
and people are running around, and we think, wow, this is happening at a fast rate.
And this computer's programmed to do only one thing, which is,
if you move your mouse, the mouse changes on the screen.
On the computer, when you move your mouse, that arrow moves around.
On this computer, if you move the mouse, it takes half an hour
for the mouse cursor to change.
To give you a sense of the speed, the scale:
the computer is just so amazingly fast, O.K.?
This is something I did for Sony in 1996.
It was three Sony "H" devices
that responded to sound.
So, if you talk into the mike,
you'll hear some music in your headphones;
if you talk in the phone, then video would happen.
So, I began to experiment with industry in different ways
with this kind of mixture of skills.
I did this ad. I don't believe in this kind of alcohol, but I do drink sometimes.
And Chanel. So, getting to do different projects.
I like to make things.
We like to make things. It's fun to make things.
And so I never developed the ability to have a staff.
I have no staff; it's all kind of made by hand --
these sort of broken hands.
And these hands were influenced
by this man, Mr. Inami Naomi.
This guy was my kind of like mentor.
He was the first digital media producer in Tokyo.
He's the guy that kind of discovered me,
and kind of got me going in digital media.
He was such an inspirational guy.
I remember, like, we'd be in his studio, like, at 2 a.m.,
and then he'd show up from some client meeting.
He'd come in and say, you know,
If I am here, everything is okay.
And you'd feel so much better, you know.
And I'll never forget how, like, but -- I'll never forget how, like,
he had a sudden situation with his -- he had an aneurysm.
He went into a coma.
And so, for three years he was out, and he could only blink,
and so I realized at this moment, I thought, wow --
how fragile is this thing we're wearing,
this body and mind we're wearing,
and so I thought, How do you go for it more?
How do you take that time you have left and go after it?
So, Naomi was pivotal in that.
This was a moment where I was thinking about,
so, you have a computer program,
it responds to motion -- X and Y --
and I realized that each computer program
has all these images inside the program.
So, if you can see here, you know,
that program you're seeing in the corner,
if you spread it out, it's all these things all at once.
It's real simultaneity. It's nothing we're used to working with.
We're so used to working in one vector.
This is all at the same time.
The computer lives in so many dimensions.
And also, at the same time I was frustrated,
because I would go to all these art and design schools everywhere,
and there were these, like, "the computer lab," you know,
and this is, like, in the late 1990s,
and this is in Basel,
a great graphic design school.
And here's this, like, dirty, kind of, shoddy,
kind of, dark computer room.
And I began to wonder, Is this the goal?
Is this what we want, you know?
you know, like copy machines -- and so this is actually in Basel.
I noticed how we spent so much time on making it interactive --
this is, like, a touch screen --
and I noticed how you can only touch five places,
and so, "why are we wasting so much interactivity everywhere?"
became a question. And also, the sound:
I discovered I can make my ThinkPad pretend it's a telephone.
You get it? No? O.K.
And also, I discovered in Logan airport,
this was, like, calling out to me.
Do you hear that? It's like cows. This is at 4 a.m. at Logan.
what is this thing in front of me, this computer thing?
It didn't make any sense.
So, I began to make things again. This is another series of objects
made of old computers from my basement.
I made -- I took my old Macintoshes
and made different objects out of them from Tokyo.
I began to be very disinterested in computers themselves,
so I began to make paintings out of PalmPilots.
I made this series of works.
They're paintings I made and put a PalmPilot in the middle
as a kind of display that's sort of thinking,
I'm abstract art. What am I? I'm abstract.
And so it keeps thinking out loud of its own abstraction.
so I spent four months making eight plastic blocks
perfectly optically transparent,
as a kind of release of stress.
Because of that, I became interested in blue tape,
so in San Francisco, at C.C., I had a whole exhibition on blue tape.
I made a whole installation out of blue tape -- blue painters' tape.
And at this point my wife kind of got worried about me,
so I stopped doing blue tape and began to think,
Well, what else is there in life?
And so computers, as you know,
these big computers, there are now tiny computers.
They're littler computers, so the one-chip computers,
I began to program one-chip computers
and make objects out of P.C. boards, LEDs.
I began to make LED sculptures
that would live inside little boxes out of MDF.
This is a series of light boxes I made for a show in Italy.
Very simple boxes: you just press one button and some LED interaction occurs.
This is a series of lamps I made. This is a Bento box lamp:
it's sort of a plastic rice lamp;
it's very friendly.
I did a show in London last year made out of iPods --
I used iPods as a material.
So I took 16 iPod Nanos
and made a kind of a Nano fish, basically.
Recently, this is for Reebok.
I've done shoes for Reebok as well,
as a kind of a hobby for apparel.
but the thing I love the most is to
experience, taste the world.
The world is just so tasty.
We think we'll go to a museum; that's where all the tastes are.
No, they're all out there.
So, this is, like, in front of the Eiffel Tower, really,
actually, around the Louvre area.
This I found, where nature had made a picture for me.
This is a perfect 90-degree angle by nature.
In this strange moment where, like, these things kind of appeared.
We all are creative people.
We have this gene defect in our mind.
We can't help but stop, right? This feeling's a wonderful thing.
It's the forever-always-on museum.
This is from the Cape last year.
I discovered that I had to find the equation of art and design,
which we know as circle-triangle-square.
It's everywhere on the beach, I discovered.
I began to collect every instance of circle-triangle-square.
I put these all back, by the way.
And I also discovered how .
some rocks are twins separated at birth.
This is also out there, you know.
I'm, like, how did this happen, kind of thing?
I brought you guys together again.
occurring in simplicity and complexity.
My alma mater, MIT, and I had this moment --
And I went after it with passion.
However, recently this RISD opportunity kind of arose --
going to RISD -- and I couldn't reconcile this real easy,
because the letters had told me, MIT forever.
But I discovered in the French word raison d'être.
I was, like, aha, wait a second.
And there RISD appeared.
And so I realized it was O.K. to go.
Who's a RISD alum out there?
RISD alums? Yeah, RISD. There we go, RISD. Woo, RISD.
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Art Center -- Art Center is good, too.
RISD is kind of my new kind of passion,
and I'll tell you a little bit about that.
So, RISD is --
I was outside RISD,
and some student wrote this on some block, and I thought,
Wow, RISD wants to know what itself is.
And I have no idea what RISD should be, actually,
although I'm a technologist, I don't like technology very much.
It's a, kind of, the qi thing, or whatever.
People say,
Are you going to bring RISD into the future?
And I say, well, I'm going to bring the future back to RISD.
the problem isn't how to make the world more technological.
It's about how to make it more humane again.
And if anything, I think RISD has a strange DNA.
It's a strange exuberance
about materials, about the world:
a fascination that I think the world needs
quite very much right now.
So, thank you everyone.
What I thought I would talk about today
is the transition from one mode
of thinking about nature
to another that's tracked by architecture.
What's interesting about architects is,
we always have tried to justify beauty
by looking to nature,
and arguably, beautiful architecture
has always been looking at a model of nature.
the hot debate in architecture
was whether the number five
or the number seven
was a better proportion to think about architecture,
because the nose was one-fifth of your head,
or because your head was one-seventh of your body.
And the reason that that was the model
of beauty and of nature
was because the decimal point had not been invented yet --
it wasn't the 16th century --
and everybody had to dimension a building
in terms of fractions,
so a room would be dimensioned
as one-fourth of a facade;
the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units,
and you would get down to the small elements
by fractional subdivision:
finer and finer and finer.
architects stopped using fractions,
and they had a new model of nature.
So, what's going on today
is that there's a model of natural form
which is calculus-based
and which is using digital tools,
and that has a lot of implications
to the way we think about beauty and form,
and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature.
The best example of this would probably be the Gothic,
and the Gothic was invented after the invention of calculus,
although the Gothic architects
weren't really using calculus to define their forms.
But what was important is,
the Gothic moment in architecture was the first time
that force and motion was thought of in terms of form.
you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting
get articulated as lines, so you're really actually seeing
the expression of structural force and form.
Much later, Robert Maillart's bridges,
which optimize structural form
with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola.
The Hanging Chain models of Antonio Gaudi,
the Catalan architect.
The end of the 19th century, beginning of the 20th century,
and how that Hanging Chain model
translates into archways
and vaulting.
So, in all of these examples,
structure is the determining force.
Frei Otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams
and foam bubble models to generate his Mannheim Concert Hall.
Interestingly, in the last 10 years
Norman Foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model
to generate the roof of the National Gallery,
with the structural engineer Chris Williams.
there's one ideal form,
because these are thought in terms of structure.
And as an architect, I've always found these kinds of systems
very limiting, because I'm not interested in ideal forms
and I'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment.
another component that needs to be thought of,
whenever you think about nature,
and that's basically the invention of
generic form in genetic evolution.
My hero is actually not Darwin;
it's a guy named William Bateson,
father of Greg Bateson, who was here for a long time in Monterey.
And he was what you'd call a teratologist:
he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations
to find rules and laws, rather than looking at the norms.
So, instead of trying to find the ideal type
or the ideal average,
he'd always look for the exception. So, in this example,
which is an example of what's called Bateson's Rule,
he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb.
When I first saw this image, 10 years ago,
I actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time.
Beautiful, because it has symmetry.
So, what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations,
instead of having a thumb,
you would either get another opposable thumb,
or you would get four fingers.
So, the mutations reverted to symmetry.
And Bateson invented
the concept of symmetry breaking,
which is that
wherever you lose information in a system,
you revert back to symmetry.
So, symmetry wasn't the sign of order and organization --
which is what I was always understanding, and as is an architect --
symmetry was the absence of information.
So, whenever you lost information, you'd move to symmetry;
whenever you added information to a system, you would break symmetry.
So, this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment
from looking for ideal shapes
to looking for a combination of
information and generic form.
and finding out what Bateson was working with,
we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching
to start to think about architectural form.
To just talk for a minute about the
digital mediums that we're using now
and how they integrate calculus:
the fact that they're calculus-based
means that we don't have to think about dimension
in terms of ideal units
or discreet elements.
big assemblies of components,
so there might be up to, say,
50,000 pieces of material
in this room you're sitting in right now
that all need to get organized.
Now, typically you'd think that they would all be the same:
like, the chairs you're sitting in would all be the same dimension.
You know, I haven't verified this, but it's the norm
that every chair would be a slightly different dimension,
because you'd want to space them all out for everybody's sight lines.
The elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting,
they're all losing their modular quality,
and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions.
That's because we're all using calculus tools
for manufacturing and for design.
So, even a straight line, defined with calculus, is a curve.
It's just a curve without inflection.
So, a new vocabulary of form
is now pervading all design fields:
whether it's automobiles, architecture, products, etc.,
it's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature.
The intricacies of scale that come out of that --
you know, in the example of the nose to the face,
there's a fractional part-to-whole idea.
With calculus, the whole idea
of subdivision is more complex,
because the whole and the parts are one continuous series.
It's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus,
so I brought some images to just describe how that works.
And in this example, you can see
that the components of this stair are repetitive,
but they're repetitive without being modular.
Each one of the elements in this structure
is a unique distance and dimension,
and all of the connections are unique angles.
Now, the only way we could design that,
or possibly construct it,
is by using a calculus-based definition
of the form.
It also is much more dynamic,
so that you can see that the same form opens and closes
in a very dynamic way as you move across it,
because it has this quality of vector in motion
built into it.
So the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume,
when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista.
And you also get a sense of
visual movement in the space,
because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern,
so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar.
I think that's one of the main changes,
also, in architecture:
that we're starting to look now not for some ideal form,
like a Latin cross for a church,
but actually all the traits of a church:
so, light that comes from behind from an invisible source,
directionality that focuses you towards an altar.
It turns out it's not rocket science
to design a sacred space.
You just need to incorporate a certain number of traits
in a very kind of genetic way.
So, these are the different perspectives of that interior,
which has a very complex
set of orientations all in a simple form.
this is a kilometer-long housing block
that was built in the '70s in Amsterdam.
And here we've broken the 500 apartments
up into small neighborhoods,
and differentiated those neighborhoods.
I won't go into too much description of any of these projects,
but what you can see is that
the escalators and elevators
that circulate people along the face of the building
are all held up by
122 structural trusses.
Because we're using escalators
to move people,
all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads.
So, every one of them is a little bit different-shaped
as you move down the length of the building.
So, working with
Bentley and MicroStation,
we've written a custom piece of software
that networks all of the components together
into these chunks of information,
so that if we change any element
along the length of the building,
not only does that change distribute
through each one of the trusses,
but each one of the trusses then distributes that information
down the length of the entire facade of the building.
So it's a single calculation
for every single component of the building
that we're adding onto.
So, it's tens of millions of calculations
just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel
and another piece of structural steel.
But what it gives us is a harmonic
and synthesized
relationship of all these components, one to another.
some product design,
and it's because design firms
that have connections to architects,
like, I'm working with Vitra, which is a furniture company,
and Alessi, which is a houseware company.
They saw this actually solving a problem:
this ability to differentiate components
but keep them synthetic.
So, not to pick on BMW,
or to celebrate them,
but take BMW as an example.
They have to, in 2005,
have a distinct identity
for all their models of cars.
So, the 300 series, or whatever their newest car is,
the 100 series that's coming out,
has to look like the 700 series,
at the other end of their product line,
so they need a distinct, coherent identity,
which is BMW.
At the same time, there's a person paying 30,000 dollars
for a 300-series car,
and a person paying 70,000 dollars
for a 700 series,
and that person paying more than double
doesn't want their car to look too much like
the bottom-of-the-market car.
So they have to also discriminate between these products.
So, as manufacturing
starts to allow more
design options,
this problem gets exacerbated,
of the whole and the parts.
is all I think about,
but in terms of product design
it's becoming more and more of an issue for companies.
So, the first kind of test product we did
was with Alessi,
which was for a coffee and tea set.
It's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set;
we knew that at the beginning. So, I actually went to some people I knew
down south in San Diego,
and we used an exploded
titanium forming method
that's used in the aerospace industry.
Basically what we can do,
is just cut a graphite mold,
put it in an oven, heat it to 1,000 degrees,
gently inflate titanium that's soft,
and then explode it at the last minute into this form.
But what's great about it is,
the forms are only a few hundred dollars.
The titanium's several thousand dollars, but the forms are very cheap.
So, we designed a system here
of eight curves that could be swapped,
very similar to that housing project I showed you,
and we could recombine those together,
so that we always had ergonomic shapes
that always had the same volume
and could always be produced in the same way.
That way, each one of these tools we could pay for with
a few hundred dollars,
and get incredible variation in the components.
And this is one of those examples of the sets.
So, for me, what was important is that
this coffee set --
which is just a coffee pot, a teapot,
and those are the pots sitting on a tray --
that they would have a coherence --
so, they would be Greg Lynn Alessi coffee pots --
but that everyone who bought one
would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way.
what's organic about architecture as a field,
unlike product design,
is this whole issue of holism
and of monumentality is really our realm.
Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object,
but also break down into small rooms
and have an identity of both the big scale
and the small scale.
Architects tend to work with signature,
so that an architect needs a signature
and that signature has to work across the scale of houses
up to, say, skyscrapers,
and that problem of signatures is a thing we're very good at maintaining
and working with; and intricacy,
which is the relationship of, say,
the shape of a building, its structure, its windows,
its color, its pattern. These are real architectural problems.
are these tropical frogs.
I got interested in them because they're the most
extreme example
of a surface where
the texture and the -- let's call it the decoration --
I know the frog doesn't think of it as decoration, but that's how it works --
are all intricately connected to one another.
So a change in the form
indicates a change in the color pattern.
So, the pattern and the form aren't the same thing,
but they really work together and are fused
in some way.
So, when doing a center
for the national parks in Costa Rica,
we tried to use that idea of a gradient color
and a change in texture
as the structure moves across the surface of the building.
We also used a continuity of change
from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum,
so it's all one continuous change
in the massing,
but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms.
the different towers of housing fused together
in shared curves so you get a single mass,
like a kind of monolith,
but it breaks down into individual elements.
And you can see that that change in massing
also gives all 48 of the apartments
a unique shape and size,
but always within a, kind of, controlled limit,
an envelope of change.
We have a company called United Architects.
We were one of the finalists for the World Trade Center site design.
And I think this just shows how
we were approaching
the problem of incredibly large-scale construction.
We wanted to make a kind of Gothic cathedral
around the footprints of the World Trade Center site.
And to do that, we tried to connect up
the five towers into a single system.
And we looked at, from the 1950s on,
there were numerous examples of other architects
trying to do the same thing.
We really approached it at the level
of the typology of the building,
where we could build these five separate towers,
but they would all join at the 60th floor
and make a kind of single monolithic mass.
With United Architects, also,
we made a proposal for the European Central Bank headquarters
that used the same system,
but this time in a much more monolithic mass,
like a sphere.
But again, you can see this, kind of,
organic fusion
of multiple building elements
to make a thing which is whole, but breaks down into smaller parts,
but in an incredibly organic way.
some of the effects of using digital fabrication.
About six years ago, I bought one of these CNC mills,
to just replace, kind of,
young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models.
And I also bought a laser cutter
and started to fabricate within my own shop,
kind of, large-scale building elements and models,
where we could go directly to the tooling.
What I found out is that the tooling,
if you intervened in the software,
actually produced decorative effects.
So, for these interiors, like this shop in Stockholm, Sweden,
or this installation wall in the Netherlands
at the Netherlands Architecture Institute,
we could use the texture that the tool would leave
to produce a lot of the spatial effects,
and we could integrate the texture of the wall
with the form of the wall with the material.
So, in vacuum-formed plastic, in fiberglass,
and then even at the level of structural steel,
which you think of as being linear and modular.
The steel industry is so far
ahead of the design industry
that if you take advantage of it
you can even start to think of beams and columns
all rolled together into a single system
which is highly efficient,
but also produces decorative effects
and formal effects
that are very beautiful and organic.
Thanks very much.
I'm going to go right into the slides.
And all I'm going to try and prove to you with these slides
is that I do just very straight stuff.
And my ideas are --
in my head, anyway -- they're very logical
and relate to what's going on and problem solving for clients.
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems,
or I really do solve their problems,
because usually they seem to like it.
Can you turn off the light? Down.
I like to be in the dark.
I don't want you to see what I'm doing up here.
and it got a lot of notoriety.
In fact, it appeared in a porno comic book,
which is the slide on the right.
I just show it because I want you to know
I'm concerned about context.
On the left-hand side,
I had the context of those little houses,
and I tried to build a building that fit into that context.
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context
they look really weird,
and my premise is that they make a lot more sense
when they're photographed or seen in that space.
And then, once I deal with the context,
I then try to make a place that's comfortable and private and fairly serene,
as I hope you'll find that slide on the right.
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law.
And we continue to work with this client.
The building on the right at the top is now under construction.
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down,
finally, and several small classrooms will be placed
along this avenue that we've created, this campus.
And it all related to the clients and the students
from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place.
They wanted a sense of place.
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space
in downtown, in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into.
And it was my theory, or my point of view,
that one didn't upstage the neighborhood --
one made accommodations.
I tried to be inclusive, to include the buildings in the neighborhood,
whether they were buildings I liked or not.
and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale's.
We even made flooring, walls and everything, out of cardboard.
And the success of it threw me for a loop.
I couldn't deal with the success of furniture --
I wasn't secure enough as an architect --
and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like.
And it was in this, preliminary to these pieces of furniture,
that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice.
And after we failed, I just kept failing.
and that ultimately led to the piece on the right --
happened when the kid that was working on this
took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up
to put it in the wastebasket.
And I put a piece of tape around it,
as you see there, and realized you could sit on it,
and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on.
So, it was an accidental discovery.
and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man,
and if you're going to go back, we might as well go back to the beginning.
And so I started making these funny things.
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger --
as the one glass at the Walker.
And then, I sliced off the head and the tail and everything
and tried to translate what I was learning
about the form of the fish and the movement.
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it --
accidental, again --
it was an intuitive kind of thing, and I just kept going with it,
and made this proposal for a building, which was only a proposal.
I was taken out to dinner after the contract
for this little restaurant was signed.
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff.
And after I got -- I was really drunk --
I was asked to do some sketches on napkins.
little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do.
And the client said, "Why no fish?"
And so I made a drawing with a fish, and I left Japan.
Three weeks later, I received a complete set of drawings
saying we'd won the competition.
because they're so beautiful -- perfect --
into a building or object like this.
And Oldenburg, who I work with a little once in a while,
told me I couldn't do it, and so that made it even more exciting.
But he was right -- I couldn't do the tail.
I started to get the head OK, but the tail I couldn't do.
It was pretty hard.
The thing on the right is a snake form, a ziggurat.
And I put them together, and you walk between them.
It was a dialog with the context again.
Now, if you saw a picture of this
as it was published in Architectural Record --
they didn't show the context, so you would think,
"God, what a pushy guy this is."
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here
looking for this restaurant.
Couldn't find it.
So ...
that you've all been talking about, I was thrown for a complete loop.
This was built in six months.
The way we sent drawings to Japan:
we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models,
and we used to make foam models, which that thing scanned.
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales.
And when I got there, everything was perfect --
except the tail.
So, I decided to cut off the head and the tail.
And it's one of the nicest pieces I've ever made, I think.
And then Jay Chiat, a friend and client,
asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
For reasons we don't want to talk about, it got delayed.
Toxic waste, I guess, is the key clue to that one.
And so we built a temporary building -- I'm getting good at temporary --
and we put a conference room in that's a fish.
And there is a story -- it's a real story -- about my grandmother
buying a carp on Thursday, bringing it home,
putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid.
I played with it in the evening.
When I went to sleep, the next day it wasn't there.
And the next night, we had gefilte fish.
and I made a pedestal for a sculpture.
And he didn't buy a sculpture, so I made one.
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother's,
and I put the fish in.
It was a joke.
We've been friends for a long time.
And we've started to work on things.
A few years ago, we did a performance piece in Venice, Italy,
called "Il Corso del Coltello" -- the Swiss Army knife.
And most of the imagery is --
and they were Claes' assistants in the play.
He was the Swiss Army knife.
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter,
and I was Frankie P. Toronto.
P for Palladio.
Dressed up like the AT&T building by Claes --
The highlight of the performance was at the end.
This beautiful object, the Swiss Army knife,
which I get credit for participating in.
And I can tell you -- it's totally an Oldenburg.
I had nothing to do with it.
The only thing I did was, I made it possible for them
to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal,
because I love sailing.
I do it because it's a curious thing in the culture,
when things are made in such great quantities,
absorbed in such great quantities,
and there's so much denial about them.
People hate it.
And I'm fascinated with that, which, like the paper furniture --
it's one of those materials.
And I'm always drawn to that.
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link,
which nobody will forgive me for.
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School.
And that chain link is really expensive.
It's in perspective and everything.
And you can see, we started making a building together.
Of course, the milk can is his.
But we were trying to collide our ideas,
to put objects next to each other.
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life.
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together.
on this funny lot in Venice, and I started with this three-piece thing,
and you entered in the middle.
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle.
And he pushed that.
And one day I had a -- oh, well, the other way.
I had the binoculars from Claes, and I put them there,
and I could never get rid of them after that.
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible
when he sent me the first model of the real proposal.
It made my building look sick.
And it was this interaction between
that kind of, up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting.
It led to the building on the left.
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars, you know,
leaving out the -- what the hell.
and I have a hard time connecting with the craft.
The whole thing about my house,
the whole use of rough carpentry and everything,
was the frustration with the crafts available.
I said, "If I can't get the craft that I want,
I'll use the craft I can get."
There were plenty of models for that,
in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns, and many artists
who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials.
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building
that was a sculpture.
And it was all of one material,
and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls.
The metalworkers, for the most part,
do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff.
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit
for the metalworkers' unions of America and Canada in Washington,
and I did it on the condition that they become my partners
in the future and help me with all future metal buildings, etc. etc.
And it's working very well
to have these people, these craftsmen, interested in it.
I just tell the stories.
It's a way of connecting, at least, with some of those people
that are so important to the realization of architecture.
And it's just a complex of factory buildings.
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place --
a people place.
I mean, it's kind of a trite thing to say,
but it is real that they wanted to have a central place
where the cafeteria would be, where the people would come
and where the people working would interact.
So it's out in the middle of nowhere, and you approach it.
It's copper and galvanize.
I used the galvanize and copper
in a very light gauge, so it would buckle.
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier's aesthetic.
Everybody's trying to get the panels perfect,
and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy.
And they end up looking like stone.
This is the central area.
There's a ramp.
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job.
And when I was awarded the contract I, at the very beginning,
asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me.
Because these were ideas that we were talking about,
building things next to each other, making --
it's all about [a] metaphor for a city, maybe.
And so Stanley did the little dome thing.
And we did it over the phone and by fax.
He would send me a fax and show me something.
He'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower.
I told him, "No, no, that's too ongepotchket.
I don't want the tower."
So he came back with a simpler building,
but he put some funny details on it,
and he moved it closer to my building.
And so I decided to put him in a depression.
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in.
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax,
going back and forth over a couple of weeks' period.
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it.
And so then I put this big billboard behind it.
And I call it, "David and Goliath."
And that's my cafeteria.
It was a very prominent building off the freeway,
and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up
and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood,
which had these cornices, projecting cornices.
Mine got a little exuberant, but I used lead copper,
which is a beautiful material, and it turns green in 100 years.
Instead of, like, copper in 10 or 15.
We redid the side of the building
and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space.
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved,
because they have very strict kind of design guideline,
and they wouldn't normally think I would fit them.
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper
and making panels and fitting it tightly
into the fabric of the existing building.
I did the Hollywood sign going and coming,
made a building out of it, and they built it.
I flew in one night and took this picture.
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me.
a little shopping center.
in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back.
It's the support labs, which, by some coincidence, required no windows.
And the shape fit perfectly.
I just joined the points.
In the curved part there's all the mechanical equipment.
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon --
and so it was an opportunity that I seized,
because I didn't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form.
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it.
They've been building it so long I don't remember where it is.
It's in the West Valley.
And we started with the stream
and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake.
These are the models.
The reality, with the lake --
the workmanship is pretty bad.
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house.
When you have to do something really cheaply,
it's hard to get perfect corners and stuff.
That big metal thing is a passage, and in it is --
you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom,
which is on the right.
It's kind of like a whole built town.
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that.
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it.
He was too busy.
He didn't recommend me, by the way.
how do you build a building that doesn't look like the language?
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided?
Etc. etc.
You've got the idea.
And so we finally ended up making it.
These people are art collectors.
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural
from the main house and all the windows are on the other side.
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it.
It's made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply --
it's that formed lumber from Finland.
We used it at Loyola on the chapel, and it didn't work.
I keep trying to make it work.
In this case we learned how to detail it.
It's never been finished.
Going out to the lake, you can see all those new buildings we built.
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site.
There's a railroad track.
This is the city hall over here somewhere, and the courthouse.
And the centerline of the mall goes out.
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built,
and so we followed.
Sohio is on the axis here,
and we followed the axis, and they're two kind of goalposts.
And this is our building,
which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company.
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top, folded.
The health club is fastened to the garage
with a C-clamp, for Cleveland.
So it's about a 10-story C-clamp.
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum,
and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry.
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries.
And this would be a hotel.
So, the centerline of this thing -- we'd preserve it,
and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings
by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox, etc., that are underway.
It's hard to do high-rise.
I feel much more comfortable down here.
And a long time ago, about '82 or something, after my house --
I designed a house for myself
that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard --
and the owner of this lot worked for me
and built that actual model on the left.
And she came back,
I guess wealthier or something -- something happened --
and asked me to design a house for her on this site.
And following that basic idea of the village,
we changed it as we got into it.
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end --
here you see on the photographs of the site --
slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms
like a retaining wall, creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom,
which I designed like a kind of a barge,
looking like a boat.
And that's it, built.
The dome was a request from the client.
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house.
She didn't care where.
When you sleep in this bedroom, I hope --
I mean, I haven't slept in it yet.
I've offered to marry her so I could sleep there,
but she said I didn't have to do that.
But when you're in that room,
you feel like you're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake.
And it's very private.
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden.
And then up above there's a garden on this side of the living room,
and one on the other side.
I don't know how to do it from here.
Focus the one on the right.
It's up there.
Left -- it's my right.
That's the living room.
Servants' quarters.
A guest bedroom, which has this dome with marble on it.
And then you enter into the living room and then so on.
This is the bedroom.
You come down from this level along the stairway,
and you enter the bedroom here, going into the lake.
And the bed is back in this space,
with windows looking out onto the lake.
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground
and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot.
The material is lead copper, like in the building in Boston.
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land --
it's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas
and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion
with a high space in it.
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis
with the dining room table.
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free.
But the idea is, the windows are all placed
so you see pieces of the house outside.
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up --
and it will be very private.
And you feel like you're in your own kind of village.
We're doing some work for him.
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour,
and there's another bridge here.
And you're through this room in a split second,
and the building will sort of reflect that.
On the backside, it's much more humane -- entrance,
dining hall, etc.
And then this thing here -- I'm hoping as you drive by you'll hear
the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it.
Kind of a fun thing to do.
which is an office building for a furniture company.
And we struggled with the image.
These are the early studies, but they have to sell furniture
to normal people, so if I did the building and it was too fancy,
then people might say, "Well, the furniture looks OK in his thing,
but no, it ain't going to look good in my normal building."
So we've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here,
and we've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them
so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate.
And you're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of
interaction between these pieces.
Palais des Sports, the Gare de Lyon over here.
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here.
There's a new library across the river.
And back in here, in this already treed park,
we're doing a very dense building called the American Center,
which has a theater, apartments, dance school, an art museum,
restaurants and all kinds of -- it's a very dense program --
bookstores, etc.
In a very tight, small --
this is the ground level.
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up
by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off.
They call it the plan coupe.
And I struggled with that thing --
how to get around the corner.
I showed you the other model, the one --
this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing --
so I understood the problem.
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it?
Apartments, etc.
And these are the kind of study models we did.
And the one on the left is pretty awful.
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built.
But out of it came finally this resolution, where the elevator piece
worked frontally to this, parallel to this street,
and also parallel to here.
And then this kind of twist, with this balcony and the skirt,
kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer.
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater, etc.
So it would all be built in stone, in French limestone,
except for this metal piece.
And it faces into a park.
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this.
On the side facing the street it's much more normal,
except I slipped a few mansards down, so that coming on the point,
these housing units made a gesture to the corner.
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard.
If any of you guys have any ideas for it, please contact me.
I don't know what to do.
to do a house for him in the Hamptons.
And it's got a fish.
And I keep thinking, "This is going to be the last fish."
It's like a drug addict.
I say, "I'm not going to do it anymore -- I don't want to do it anymore --
I'm not going to do it."
And then I do it.
But it's the living room.
And this piece here is --
I don't know what it is.
I just added it so that we'd have enough money in the budget
so we could take something out.
that presented to you earlier.
We've had a lot of fun working together.
I think I'm from Mars for them, and they are for me,
but somehow we all manage to work together,
and I think, productively.
So far.
This is a shopping thing.
You come into the Magic Kingdom
and the hotel that Tony Baxter's group is doing out here.
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall,
with a rodeo and restaurants.
And another restaurant.
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull,
I made a light grid that's perpendicular to the train station,
to the route of the train.
It looks like it's kind of been there,
and then crashed all these simpler forms into it.
The light grid will have a light, be lit up at night and give a
kind of light ceiling.
In Switzerland -- Germany, actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel,
we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum.
there's an Oldenburg sculpture over here --
I tried to make a relationship urbanistically.
And I don't gave good slides to show -- it's just been completed --
but this piece here is this building, and these pieces here and here.
And as you pass by it's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces
accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood.
It's plaster and just zinc.
And you wonder, if this is a museum,
what it's going to be like inside?
If it's going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn't show anything,
and just wait.
I'm so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful.
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit.
It's actually basically three square rooms
with a couple of skylights and stuff.
And from the building in the back, you see it as
an iceberg floating by in the hills.
I know I'm over time.
See, that skylight goes down and becomes that one.
So it's pretty quiet inside.
It's a complicated project.
It has a chamber hall.
It's related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built
with a lot of love and tears and caring.
And it's not a great building, but I approached it optimistically,
that we would make a compositional relationship between us
that would strengthen both of us.
And the plan of this -- it's a concert hall.
This is the foyer, which is kind of a garden structure.
There's commercial at the ground floor.
These are offices, which, really, in the competition,
we didn't have to design.
But finally, there's a hotel there.
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler,
composing these elevations together and relating them
to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA, etc.
which led to this compartmentalized scheme,
which we found out after the competition would not work at all.
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space,
and so that's one of the problems of a competition.
You have to then try and get that back in some way.
And we studied many models.
This was our original model.
These were the three buildings that were the ideal --
the Concertgebouw, Boston and Berlin.
Everybody liked the surround.
Actually, this is the smallest hall in size,
and it has more seats than any of these
because it has double balconies.
Our client doesn't want balconies, so --
and when we met our new acoustician, he told us
this was the right shape or this was the right shape.
And we tried many shapes, trying to get the energy
of the original design within an acoustical, acceptable format.
We finally settled on a shape that was
the proportion of the Concertgebouw
with the sloping outside walls, which the acoustician said
were crucial to this and later decided they weren't,
but now we have them.
and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room.
That's the idea.
And the corners would have skylights
and these columns would be structural.
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a
kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit,
and create intimacy.
Now, this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being --
and so I wouldn't take it literally, except the feeling of the space.
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff,
and they bounce them off this and see where it all works.
But you get the sense of the hall in section.
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium.
In this case we're opening it back up
and getting skylights in the four corners.
And so it will be quite a different shape.
fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well.
When you get into a box, it's harder to do it -- and here we are,
struggling with how to put the hotel in.
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi.
I just stuck it on there.
But this is how I do work. I do take pieces and bits and look at it
and struggle with it and cut it away.
And of course it's not going to look like that,
but it is the crazy way I tend to work.
at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower, the highest building in L.A.
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs.
And I was asked to do a fish, and so I did a snake.
and you can go in it.
It's a kiva, and Larry's putting some water in there,
and it works much better than a fish.
at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by
Skidmore, Owings and Merrill.
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel,
non-fire proof, much like those old gas tanks.
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it,
perverted it, into the form of the fish, and created a kind of
a 19th-century contraption that looks like, that will sit --
this is the beach and the harbor out in front,
and this is really a shopping center with department stores.
And we split these bridges.
Originally, this was all solid with a hole in it.
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of
a foreground for this hotel.
We showed this to the hotel people the other day,
and they were terrified and said that nobody would come
to the Ritz-Carlton anymore, because of this fish.
I didn't expect Lou Danziger to be here,
but this is a building I did for him in 1964, I think.
A little studio -- and it's sadly for sale.
Time goes on.
He designed the robot as the cashier, and the head moves,
and I did the rest of it.
And the food wasn't as good as the stuff, and so it failed.
It should have been the other way around --
the food should have been good first.
It didn't work.
My name is Joseph, a Member of Parliament in Kenya.
Picture a Maasai village,
and ask each elder to bring one boy to school.
That's how I went to school --
pretty much a government guy pointing a gun
and told my father, "You have to make a choice."
I walked very comfortably to this missionary school,
that was run by an American missionary.
The first thing the American missionary gave me was a candy.
I had never in my life ever tasted candy.
My family moved; we're nomads.
It was a boarding school, I was seven --
Every time it closed you had to travel to find them.
40-50 miles, it doesn't matter.
You slept in the bush, but you kept going.
All of a sudden I passed the national examination,
found myself in a very beautiful high school in Kenya.
My mother still lived in a cow-dung hut,
none of my brothers were going to school,
and this man told me, "Here, go."
I wrote a book for National Geographic and taught U.S. history.
listening to their problems --
sick people, people with no water, all this stuff --
This specific tribe was really afraid of this other Luhya tribe.
Every time, they sent scouts to make sure no one attacked them.
"The enemies are coming. Only half an hour away, they'll be here."
The leader of the chiefs said, "No, sorry. We can't take you. You'll slow us down.
We have to flee our women and children, we have to run."
And they were left behind, waiting to die.
The blind man said, "Look, I'm a very strong man but I can't see."
The man with no legs says, "I can see as far as the end of the world,
but I can't save myself from a cat, or whatever animals."
and told the man with no legs to go over his back, and stood up.
The man on top can see, the blind man can walk.
And that man told me, "So, here you are.
We want you to be our eyes, we'll give you the legs.
We'll walk you, you lead us."
"What can I do to help my people?
Every time you go to an area where for 43 years of independence,
we still don't have basic health facilities.
because people from outside can come and help us,
some become doctors, some lawyers --
we want to produce a comprehensive group of people,
students who can come back and help us see a community grow
and as I continue listening to all of you talking about botany,
health, democracy, new inventions,
I'm hoping that one day in my own little community --
which is 26,000 square km,
we'll be able to become a model to help others develop.
Last year, I told you the story, in seven minutes, of Project Orion,
which was this very implausible technology
that technically could have worked,
but it had this one-year political window where it could have happened.
So it didn't happen. It was a dream that did not happen.
This year I'm going to tell you the story of the birth of digital computing.
This was a perfect introduction.
And it's a story that did work. It did happen,
and the machines are all around us.
And it was a technology that was inevitable.
If the people I'm going to tell you the story about,
if they hadn't done it, somebody else would have.
So, it was sort of the right idea at the right time.
It's the universe in which these machines
are now doing all these things, including changing biology.
I'm starting the story with the first atomic bomb at Trinity,
which was the Manhattan Project. It was a little bit like TED:
it brought a whole lot of very smart people together.
And three of the smartest people were
Stan Ulam, Richard Feynman and John von Neumann.
And it was Von Neumann who said, after the bomb,
he was working on something much more important than bombs:
he's thinking about computers.
So, he wasn't only thinking about them; he built one. This is the machine he built.
and we had a beautiful demonstration of how this thing really works,
with these little bits. And it's an idea that goes way back.
The first person to really explain that
was Thomas Hobbes, who, in 1651,
explained how arithmetic and logic are the same thing,
and if you want to do artificial thinking and artificial logic,
you can do it all with arithmetic.
He said you needed addition and subtraction.
Leibniz, who came a little bit later -- this is 1679 --
showed that you didn't even need subtraction.
You could do the whole thing with addition.
Here, we have all the binary arithmetic and logic
that drove the computer revolution.
And Leibniz was the first person to really talk about building such a machine.
He talked about doing it with marbles,
having gates and what we now call shift registers,
where you shift the gates, drop the marbles down the tracks.
And that's what all these machines are doing,
except, instead of doing it with marbles,
they're doing it with electrons.
when he sort of reinvents the whole same thing.
And 1945, after the war, the electronics existed
to actually try and build such a machine.
So June 1945 -- actually, the bomb hasn't even been dropped yet --
and Von Neumann is putting together all the theory to actually build this thing,
which also goes back to Turing,
who, before that, gave the idea that you could do all this
with a very brainless, little, finite state machine,
just reading a tape in and reading a tape out.
The other sort of genesis of what Von Neumann did
was the difficulty of how you would predict the weather.
Lewis Richardson saw how you could do this with a cellular array of people,
giving them each a little chunk, and putting it together.
Here, we have an electrical model illustrating a mind having a will,
but capable of only two ideas.
It's basically why you need the qubit,
because it only has two ideas.
you get the essentials of the modern computer:
the arithmetic unit, the central control, the memory,
the recording medium, the input and the output.
But, there's one catch. This is the fatal -- you know,
we saw it in starting these programs up.
The instructions which govern this operation
must be given in absolutely exhaustive detail.
So, the programming has to be perfect, or it won't work.
the classic history sort of takes it all back to the ENIAC here.
But actually, the machine I'm going to tell you about,
the Institute for Advanced Study machine, which is way up there,
really should be down there. So, I'm trying to revise history,
and give some of these guys more credit than they've had.
Such a computer would open up universes,
which are, at the present, outside the range of any instruments.
So it opens up a whole new world, and these people saw it.
The guy who was supposed to build this machine
was the guy in the middle, Vladimir Zworykin, from RCA.
RCA, in probably one of the lousiest business decisions
of all time, decided not to go into computers.
But the first meetings, November 1945, were at RCA's offices.
RCA started this whole thing off, and said, you know,
televisions are the future, not computers.
all the things that make these machines run.
Von Neumann, and a logician, and a mathematician from the army
put this together. Then, they needed a place to build it.
When RCA said no, that's when they decided to build it in Princeton,
where Freeman works at the Institute.
That's where I grew up as a kid.
That's me, that's my sister Esther, who's talked to you before,
so we both go back to the birth of this thing.
That's Freeman, a long time ago,
and that was me.
And this is Von Neumann and Morgenstern,
who wrote the "Theory of Games."
All these forces came together there, in Princeton.
Oppenheimer, who had built the bomb.
The machine was actually used mainly for doing bomb calculations.
And Julian Bigelow, who took
Zworkykin's place as the engineer, to actually figure out, using electronics,
how you would build this thing. The whole gang of people who came to work on this,
and women in front, who actually did most of the coding, were the first programmers.
These were the prototype geeks, the nerds.
They didn't fit in at the Institute.
This is a letter from the director, concerned about --
"especially unfair on the matter of sugar."
They were real soldering-gun type guys, and they actually built this thing.
has billions of transistors, doing billions of cycles per second without failing.
They were using vacuum tubes, very narrow, sloppy techniques
to get actually binary behavior out of these radio vacuum tubes.
They actually used 6J6, the common radio tube,
because they found they were more reliable than the more expensive tubes.
And what they did at the Institute was publish every step of the way.
Reports were issued, so that this machine was cloned
at 15 other places around the world.
And it really was. It was the original microprocessor.
All the computers now are copies of that machine.
The memory was in cathode ray tubes --
a whole bunch of spots on the face of the tube --
very, very sensitive to electromagnetic disturbances.
So, there's 40 of these tubes,
like a V-40 engine running the memory.
This is a wire drive, using bicycle wheels.
This is the archetype of the hard disk that's in your machine now.
Then they switched to a magnetic drum.
This is modifying IBM equipment,
which is the origins of the whole data-processing industry, later at IBM.
And this is the beginning of computer graphics.
The "Graph'g-Beam Turn On." This next slide,
that's the -- as far as I know -- the first digital bitmap display, 1954.
doing abstract sorts of studies of how you could build
reliable machines out of unreliable components.
Those guys drinking all the tea with sugar in it
were writing in their logbooks, trying to get this thing to work, with all
these 2,600 vacuum tubes that failed half the time.
And that's what I've been doing, this last six months, is going through the logs.
"Running time: two minutes. Input, output: 90 minutes."
This includes a large amount of human error.
So they are always trying to figure out, what's machine error? What's human error?
What's code, what's hardware?
trying to figure out why the memory's not in focus.
He had to focus the memory -- seems OK.
So, he had to focus each tube just to get the memory up and running,
let alone having, you know, software problems.
"before closing down in disgust ... "
Burning lots of midnight oil.
Mathematical and Numerical Integrator and Calculator, "lost its memory."
Twenty-four hours a day, this thing was running, mainly running bomb calculations.
smell of burning V-belts in the air."
So they really were working under tough conditions.
behind the regulator rack, set blower to vibrating. Result: no more mouse."
"Here lies Marston Mouse."
If you're a mathematician, you get that,
because Marston was a mathematician who
objected to the computer being there.
That's two thousand cycles per second --
"yes, I'm chicken" -- so two kilocycles was slow speed.
The high speed was 16 kilocycles.
I don't know if you remember a Mac that was 16 Megahertz,
that's slow speed.
How will I know which is right, assuming one result is correct?
This now is the third different output.
I know when I'm licked."
"Machine a thing of beauty, and a joy forever." "Perfect running."
They're designing hydrogen bombs. But someone in the logbook,
late one night, finally drew a bomb.
So, that was the result. It was Mike,
the first thermonuclear bomb, in 1952.
That was designed on that machine,
in the woods behind the Institute.
from all over the world to work on all these problems.
Barricelli, he came to do what we now call, really, artificial life,
trying to see if, in this artificial universe --
he was a viral-geneticist, way, way, way ahead of his time.
He's still ahead of some of the stuff that's being done now.
Trying to start an artificial genetic system running in the computer.
Began -- his universe started March 3, '53.
So it's almost exactly -- it's 50 years ago next Tuesday, I guess.
And he saw everything in terms of --
he could read the binary code straight off the machine.
He had a wonderful rapport.
Other people couldn't get the machine running. It always worked for him.
Even errors were duplicated.
When the bomb people went home, he was allowed in there.
He would run that thing all night long, running these things,
if anybody remembers Stephen Wolfram,
who reinvented this stuff.
And he published it. It wasn't locked up and disappeared.
It was published in the literature.
"If it's that easy to create living organisms, why not create a few yourself?"
So, he decided to give it a try,
to start this artificial biology going in the machines.
And he found all these, sort of --
it was like a naturalist coming in
and looking at this tiny, 5,000-byte universe,
and seeing all these things happening
that we see in the outside world, in biology.
This is some of the generations of his universe.
But they're just going to stay numbers;
they're not going to become organisms.
They have to have something.
You have a genotype and you have to have a phenotype.
They have to go out and do something. And he started doing that,
started giving these little numerical organisms things they could play with --
playing chess with other machines and so on.
And they did start to evolve.
And he went around the country after that.
Every time there was a new, fast machine, he started using it,
and saw exactly what's happening now.
That the programs, instead of being turned off -- when you quit the program,
you'd keep running
and, basically, all the sorts of things like Windows is doing,
running as a multi-cellular organism on many machines,
he envisioned all that happening.
And he saw that evolution itself was an intelligent process.
It wasn't any sort of creator intelligence,
but the thing itself was a giant parallel computation
that would have some intelligence.
And he went out of his way to say
that he was not saying this was lifelike,
or a new kind of life.
It just was another version of the same thing happening.
And there's really no difference between what he was doing in the computer
and what nature did billions of years ago.
And could you do it again now?
the archivist came up one day, saying,
"I think we found another box that had been thrown out."
And it was his universe on punch cards.
So there it is, 50 years later, sitting there -- sort of suspended animation.
That's the instructions for running --
this is actually the source code
for one of those universes,
with a note from the engineers
saying they're having some problems.
"There must be something about this code that you haven't explained yet."
And I think that's really the truth. We still don't understand
how these very simple instructions can lead to increasing complexity.
What's the dividing line between
when that is lifelike and when it really is alive?
These cards, now, thanks to me showing up, are being saved.
And the question is, should we run them or not?
You know, could we get them running?
Do you want to let it loose on the Internet?
These machines would think they --
these organisms, if they came back to life now --
whether they've died and gone to heaven, there's a universe.
My laptop is 10 thousand million times
the size of the universe that they lived in when Barricelli quit the project.
how this would really grow into a new kind of life.
And that's what's happening!
When Juan Enriquez told us about
these 12 trillion bits being transferred back and forth,
of all this genomics data going to the proteomics lab,
that's what Barricelli imagined:
that this digital code in these machines
is actually starting to code --
it already is coding from nucleic acids.
We've been doing that since, you know, since we started PCR
and synthesizing small strings of DNA.
And real soon, we're actually going to be synthesizing the proteins,
and, like Steve showed us, that just opens an entirely new world.
This was published after he died: his sort of unfinished notes
on self-reproducing machines,
what it takes to get the machines sort of jump-started
to where they begin to reproduce.
It took really three people:
Barricelli had the concept of the code as a living thing;
Von Neumann saw how you could build the machines --
that now, last count, four million
of these Von Neumann machines is built every 24 hours;
and Julian Bigelow, who died 10 days ago --
this is John Markoff's obituary for him --
he was the important missing link,
the engineer who came in
and knew how to put those vacuum tubes together and make it work.
And all our computers have, inside them,
the copies of the architecture that he had to just design
one day, sort of on pencil and paper.
And we owe a tremendous credit to that.
And he explained, in a very generous way,
the spirit that brought all these different people to
the Institute for Advanced Study in the '40s to do this project,
and make it freely available with no patents, no restrictions,
no intellectual property disputes to the rest of the world.
when the machine was shut down, July 1958.
And it's Julian Bigelow who was running it until midnight
when the machine was officially turned off.
And that's the end.
Frank Gehry: I listened to this scientist this morning.
Dr. Mullis was talking about his experiments,
and I realized that I almost became a scientist.
When I was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set
and I decided to make water.
(Laughter)
So, I made a hydrogen generator and I made an oxygen generator,
and I had the two pipes leading into a beaker
and I threw a match in.
(Laughter)
And the glass -- luckily I turned around --
I had it all in my back
and I was about 15 feet away.
The wall was covered with ...
I had an explosion.
to see if I was okay.
RSW: ... huh. (Laughter)
this session again.
The gentleman to my left is the very famous, perhaps overly famous,
Frank Gehry.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And Frank, you've come to a place in your life, which is astonishing.
I mean it is astonishing for an artist, for an architect,
to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time.
I mean you have become, whether you can giggle at it
because it's a funny ... you know, it's a strange thought,
but your building is an icon --
you can draw a little picture of that building, it can be used in ads --
and you've had not rock star status, but celebrity status
in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life.
And I know the road was extremely difficult.
And it didn't seem, at least, that your sell outs,
whatever they were, were very big.
You kept moving ahead in a life where you're dependent
on working for somebody.
But that's an interesting thing for a creative person.
A lot of us work for people;
we're in the hands of other people.
And that's one of the great dilemmas -- we're in a creativity session --
it's one of the great dilemmas in creativity:
how to do work that's big enough and not sell out.
And you've achieved that
and that makes your win doubly big, triply big.
It's not quite a question but you can comment on it.
It's a big issue.
I've never really gone out looking for work.
I always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head.
And when I started out,
I thought that architecture was a service business
and that you had to please the clients and stuff.
And I realized when I'd come into the meetings
with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff,
and people would just look at me
like I'd just landed from Mars.
But I couldn't do anything else.
That was my response to the people in the time.
And actually, it was responding to clients that I had
who didn't have very much money, so they couldn't afford very much.
I think it was circumstantial.
We bought this tiny little bungalow in Santa Monica
and for like 50 grand I built a house around it.
And a few people got excited about it.
I was visiting with an artist, Michael Heizer,
out in the desert near Las Vegas somewhere.
He's building this huge concrete place.
And it was late in the evening. We'd had a lot to drink.
We were standing out in the desert all alone and,
thinking about my house, he said,
"Did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent,
somewhere in 2000 years somebody's going to like it?"
(Laughter)
So, I thought, "Yeah, that's probably a good idea."
Luckily I started to get some clients that had a little more money,
so the stuff was a little more permanent.
But I just found out the world ain't going to last that long,
this guy was telling us the other day.
So where do we go now?
Back to -- everything's so temporary.
For me, every day is a new thing.
I approach each project with a new insecurity,
almost like the first project I ever did,
and I get the sweats,
I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going --
if I knew where I was going, I wouldn't do it.
When I can predict or plan it, I don't do it.
I discard it.
So I approach it with the same trepidation.
Obviously, over time I have a lot more confidence
that it's going to be OK.
I do run a kind of a business --
I've got 120 people
and you've got to pay them,
so there's a lot of responsibility involved --
but the actual work on the project is with,
I think, a healthy insecurity.
you're not sure.
When Bilbao was finished and I looked at it,
I saw all the mistakes, I saw ...
They weren't mistakes;
I saw everything that I would have changed
and I was embarrassed by it.
I felt an embarrassment -- "How could I have done that?
How could I have made shapes like that or done stuff like that?"
It's taken several years to now look at it detached and say --
as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road
and the street, and it appears to have a relationship --
that I started to like it.
Tom Krens came to me with Bilbao and explained it all to me,
and I thought he was nuts.
I didn't think he knew what he was doing,
and he pulled it off.
So, I think he's Icarus and Phoenix all in one guy.
(Laughter)
He gets up there and then he ... comes back up.
They're still talking about it.
September 11 generated some interest
in moving it over to Ground Zero,
and I'm totally against that.
I just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on Ground Zero
I think for a long time.
is that Disney?
and when will that be finished?
and I'm hoping Kyu, and Herbie, and Yo-Yo and all those guys
come play with us at that place.
Luckily, today most of the people I'm working with are people I really like.
Richard Koshalek is probably one of the main reasons
that Disney Hall came to me.
He's been a cheerleader for quite a long time.
There aren't many people around that are really involved
with architecture as clients.
If you think about the world,
and even just in this audience,
most of us are involved with buildings.
Nothing that you would call architecture, right?
And so to find one, a guy like that,
you hang on to him.
He's become the head of Art Center,
and there's a building by Craig Ellwood there.
I knew Craig and respected him.
They want to add to it
and it's hard to add to a building like that --
it's a beautiful, minimalist, black steel building --
and Richard wants to add a library and more student stuff
and it's a lot of acreage.
I convinced him to let me bring in another architect
from Portugal: Alvaro Siza.
(Laughter)
and is probably considered the Portuguese main guy in architecture.
I visited with him a few years ago
and he showed me his early work,
and his early work had a resemblance to my early work.
When I came out of college,
I started to try to do things contextually in Southern California,
and you got into the logic of Spanish colonial tile roofs
and things like that.
I tried to understand that language as a beginning,
as a place to jump off,
and there was so much of it being done by spec builders
and it was trivialized so much that it wasn't ...
I just stopped.
I mean, Charlie Moore did a bunch of it,
but it didn't feel good to me.
Siza, on the other hand, continued in Portugal
where the real stuff was
and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language.
And I always felt that he should come to Southern California
and do a building.
I tried to get him a couple of jobs and they didn't pan out.
I like the idea of collaboration with people like that
because it pushes you.
I've done it with Claes Oldenburg and with Richard Serra,
who doesn't think architecture is art.
Did you see that thing?
RSW: No. What did he say?
(Laughter)
It's a richer experience.
It must be like that for Kyu doing things with musicians --
it's similar to that I would imagine --
where you ... huh?
(Laughter)
Where you ... It's like jazz: you improvise, you work together,
you play off each other, you make something,
they make something.
And I think
for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city
and what might happen in the city.
Or is it going to be down near ...
Anyway, he's that kind of patron.
It's not his money, of course.
(Laughter)
What's the schedule, Richard?
Richard Koshalek: [Unclear] starts from 2004.
You can come to the opening. I'll invite you.
No, but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting
because it creates chaos, right?
Everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment,
and if you can figure out how to work off each other --
if you can get a bunch of people
who respect each other's work and play off each other,
you might be able to create models for
how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect.
Like the Rockefeller Center model,
which is kind of from another era.
My preconception of Bilbao was this wonderful building,
you go inside and there'd be extraordinary spaces.
I'd seen drawings you had presented here at TED.
The surprise of Bilbao was in its context to the city.
That was the surprise of going across the river,
of going on the highway around it,
of walking down the street and finding it.
That was the real surprise of Bilbao.
most architects when they present their work --
most of the people we know,
you get up and you talk about your work,
and it's almost like you tell everybody you're a good guy
by saying, "Look, I'm worried about the context,
I'm worried about the city,
I'm worried about my client,
I worry about budget, that I'm on time."
Blah, blah, blah and all that stuff.
And it's like cleansing yourself so that you can ...
by saying all that, it means your work is good somehow.
And I think everybody --
I mean that should be a matter of fact, like gravity.
You're not going to defy gravity.
You've got to work with the building department.
If you don't meet the budgets, you're not going to get much work.
If it leaks --
Bilbao did not leak.
I was so proud.
(Laughter)
The MIT project -- they were interviewing me for MIT
and they sent their facilities people to Bilbao.
I met them in Bilbao.
They came for three days.
They were there three days and it rained every day
and they kept walking around --
I noticed they were looking under things
and looking for things,
and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden, you know?
People put buckets out ...
I was clean. There wasn't a bloody leak in the place,
it was just fantastic.
But you've got to --
yeah, well up until then every building leaked, so this ...
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
when the woman called and said,
"Mr. Wright, I'm sitting on the couch
and the water's pouring in on my head."
And he said, "Madam, move your chair."
(Laughter)
So, some years later I was doing a building,
a little house on the beach for Norton Simon,
and his secretary, who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady,
called me and said,
"Mr. Simon's sitting at his desk
and the water's coming in on his head."
And I told her the Frank Lloyd Wright story.
(Laughter)
OK, you solved all the problems,
you did all the stuff, you made nice,
you loved your clients,
you loved the city,
you're a good guy, you're a good person ...
and then what?
What do you bring to it?
And I think that's what I've always been interested in,
is that -- which is a personal kind of expression.
Bilbao, I think, shows that you can have
that kind of personal expression
and still touch all the bases that are necessary
of fitting into the city.
That's what reminded me of it.
And I think that's the issue, you know;
it's the "then what" that most clients who hire architects --
most clients aren't hiring architects for that.
They're hiring them to get it done, get it on budget,
be polite,
and they're missing out on the real value of an architect.
when Michael Graves was a fashion, before teapots ...
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Is that a curse, that people want a Bilbao building?
Since Bilbao opened, which is now four, five years,
both Krens and I have been called
with at least 100 opportunities --
China, Brazil, other parts of Spain --
to come in and do the Bilbao effect.
And I've met with some of these people.
Usually I say no right away,
but some of them come with pedigree
and they sound well-intentioned
and they get you for at least one or two meetings.
In one case, I flew all the way to Malaga with a team
because the thing was signed with seals and various
very official seals from the city,
and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port.
I asked them what kind of building it was.
"When you get here we'll explain it." Blah, blah, blah.
So four of us went.
And they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel
and we were looking over the bay,
and then they took us in a boat out in the water
and showed us all these sights in the harbor.
Each one was more beautiful than the other.
And then we were going to have lunch with the mayor
and we were going to have dinner with
the most important people in Malaga.
Just before going to lunch with the mayor,
we went to the harbor commissioner.
It was a table as long as this carpet
and the harbor commissioner was here,
and I was here, and my guys.
We sat down, and we had a drink of water
and everybody was quiet.
And the guy looked at me and said,
"Now what can I do for you, Mr. Gehry?"
(Laughter)
FG: So, I got up.
I said to my team,
"Let's get out of here."
We stood up, we walked out.
They followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said,
"You mean you're not going to have lunch with the mayor?"
I said, "Nope."
"You're not going to have dinner at all?"
They just brought us there to hustle this group,
you know, to create a project.
And we get a lot of that.
Luckily, I'm old enough that
I can complain I can't travel.
(Laughter)
I don't have my own plane yet.
because it's been very long.
But let me just say a couple words.
Are you going to talk about me or you?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Roy Gould: Less than a year from now,
the world is going to celebrate the International Year of Astronomy,
which marks the 400th anniversary
of Galileo's first glimpse of the night sky through a telescope.
In a few months, the world is also going to celebrate
the launch of a new invention from Microsoft Research,
which I think is going to have as profound an impact
on the way we view the universe as Galileo did four centuries ago.
It's called the WorldWide Telescope,
and I want to thank TED and Microsoft for allowing me to bring it to your attention.
And I want to urge you, when you get a chance,
to give it a closer look at the TED Lab downstairs.
from the world's greatest telescopes on Earth and in space,
and has woven them seamlessly
to produce a holistic view of the universe.
It's going to change the way we do astronomy,
it's going to change the way we teach astronomy
and I think most importantly
it's going to change the way we see ourselves in the universe.
that might not be so big a claim.
In 1920, for example, you weren't allowed to drink;
if you were a woman, you weren't allowed to vote;
and if you looked up at the stars and the Milky Way on a summer night,
what you saw was thought to be the entire universe.
In fact, the head of Harvard's observatory back then
gave a great debate in which he argued
that the Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.
Of course, we know today that galaxies extend far beyond our own galaxy.
We can see all the way out to the edge of the observable universe,
all the way back in time,
almost to the moment of the Big Bang itself.
We can see across the entire spectrum of light,
revealing worlds that had previously been invisible.
We see these magnificent star nurseries,
where nature has somehow arranged for just the right numbers
and just the right sizes of stars to be born for life to arise.
We see alien worlds, we see alien solar systems --
300 now, and still counting --
and they're not like us.
We see black holes at the heart of our galaxy,
in the Milky Way, and elsewhere in the universe,
where time itself seems to stand still.
But until now, our view of the universe has been disconnected and fragmented,
and I think that many of the marvelous stories that nature has to tell us
have fallen through the cracks. And that's changing.
why my colleagues and I, in astronomy and in education,
are so excited about the WorldWide Telescope
and why we think it's truly transformative.
First, it enables you to experience the universe:
the WorldWide Telescope, for me, is a kind of magic carpet
that lets you navigate through the universe where you want to go.
Second: you can tour the universe with astronomers as your guides.
And I'm not talking here about just experts who are telling you what you're seeing,
but really people who are passionate about the various nooks and crannies of the universe,
who can share their enthusiasm
and can make the universe a welcoming place.
And third, you can create your own tours --
you can share them with friends, you can create them with friends --
and that's the part that I think I'm most excited about
because I think that at heart, we are all storytellers.
And in telling stories,
each of us is going to understand the universe in our own way.
We're going to have a personal universe.
I think we're going to see a community of storytellers evolve and emerge.
I just want to leave you with this brief thought:
when I ask people, "How does the night sky make you feel?"
they often say, "Oh, tiny. I feel tiny and insignificant."
Well, our gaze fills the universe.
And thanks to the creators of the WorldWide Telescope,
we can now start to have a dialogue with the universe.
I think the WorldWide Telescope will convince you
that we may be tiny, but we are truly, wonderfully significant.
Thank you.
(Applause)
to introduce Curtis Wong from Microsoft. (Applause)
So, what you're seeing here is a wonderful presentation,
but it's one of the tours.
And actually this tour is one that was created earlier.
And the tours are all totally interactive,
so that if I were to go somewhere ...
you may be watching a tour and you can pause anywhere along the way,
pull up other information --
there are lots of Web and information sources
about places you might want to go --
you can zoom in, you can pull back out.
The whole resources are there available for you.
who's our colleague, and a lot of his work that he did
is really what makes this project possible.
It's a labor of love for us and our small team,
and we really hope it will inspire kids to explore and learn about the universe.
So basically, kids of all ages, like us.
It'll be a free download -- thank you, Craig Mundie --
and it'll be available at the website WorldWideTelescope.org,
which is something new.
And so, what you've seen today
is less than a fraction of one percent of what is in here,
and in the TED Lab, we have a tour
that was created by a six-year-old named Benjamin
that will knock your socks off. (Laughter)
So we'll see you there. Thank you.
(Applause)
Well, good morning.
You know, the computer and television both recently turned 60,
and today I'd like to talk about their relationship.
Despite their middle age, if you've been following the themes
of this conference or the entertainment industry,
it's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other.
So it's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television,
or why the invention of the atomic bomb
unleashed forces that lead to the writers' strike.
And it's not just what these are doing to each other,
but it's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter.
and it's been a theme we've talked about all week,
I recently talked to a bunch of tweeners.
I wrote on cards: "television," "radio," "MySpace," "Internet," "PC."
And I said, just arrange these, from what's important to you
and what's not, and then tell me why.
Let's listen to what happens when they get to the portion
of the discussion on television.
because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs.
Girl 2: I think we -- the reasons, one of the reasons we put computer before TV
is because nowadays, like, we have TV shows on the computer.
(Girl 3: Oh, yeah.)
Girl 2: And then you can download onto your iPod.
Girl 2: That would be so stressful.
Girl 5: No.
Girl 3: Like the stock market, it goes up and down and stuff.
I think right now the computers will be at the top
and everything will be kind of going down and stuff.
and the tech business, really ever since they both turned about 30.
We go through periods of enthrallment,
followed by reactions in boardrooms, in the finance community
best characterized as, what's the finance term? Ick pooey.
and Warner buys Atari because video games are on the rise.
The next year they march forward and they introduce Qube,
the first interactive cable TV system,
and the New York Times heralds this
as telecommunications moving to the home,
convergence, great things are happening.
Everybody in the East Coast gets in the pictures --
Citicorp, Penney, RCA -- all getting into this big vision.
By the way, this is about when I enter the picture.
I'm going to do a summer internship at Time Warner.
That summer I'm all -- I'm at Warner that summer --
I'm all excited to work on convergence, and then the bottom falls out.
Doesn't work out too well for them, they lose money.
And I had a happy brush with convergence
until, kind of, Warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing.
on kind of entertainment and technology
because I have to be exiled to California, where the remaining jobs are,
almost to the sea, to go to work for Apple Computer.
Warner, of course, writes off more than 400 million dollars.
Four hundred million dollars, which was real money back in the '70s.
But they were onto something and they got better at it.
By the year 2000, the process was perfected. They merged with AOL,
and in just four years, managed to shed about 200 billion dollars
of market capitalization, showing that they'd actually mastered the art
of applying Moore's law of successive miniaturization
to their balance sheet.
or the media community, is driven so crazy by the tech community
is that tech folks talk differently.
You know, for 50 years, we've talked about changing the world,
about total transformation.
For 50 years, it's been about hopes and fears
and promises of a better world. And I got to thinking,
you know, who else talks that way?
And the answer is pretty clearly --
it's people in religion and in politics.
not as a business cycle, but as a messianic movement.
We promise something great, we evangelize it,
we're going to change the world. It doesn't work out too well,
and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again,
as the people in New York and L.A. look on in absolute, morbid astonishment.
But it's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing.
of media and entertainment, how did we get here?
I mean, how did a machine that was built for accounting
and artillery morph into media?
to solve military problems, but things got really interesting
just a couple of years later -- 1949 with Whirlwind,
built at MIT's Lincoln Lab. Jay Forrester was building this for the Navy,
but you can't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind
a machine that might actually be a potential media star.
So take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist
of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers,
and the computer begins to express itself.
With considerable trepidation,
we undertake to interview this new machine.
And this is the oscilloscope of the Whirlwind electronic computer.
Would you like if I used the machine?
Since this computer was made
in conjunction with the Office of Naval Research,
why don't we switch down to the Pentagon in Washington
and let the Navy's research chief, Admiral Bolster,
give Whirlwind the workout?
This rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky.
Now, at the standard rate of fuel consumption,
I would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket
and see how it can determine, at any instant,
say at the end of 40 seconds, the amount of fuel remaining,
and the velocity at that set instant.
JF: Over on the left-hand side,
you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off.
And on the right-hand side, there's a scale
that shows the rocket's velocity.
The rocket's position is shown by the trajectory
that we're now looking at.
And as it reaches the peak of its trajectory,
the velocity, you will notice, has dropped off to a minimum.
Then, as the rocket dives down, velocity picks up again
toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground.
Journalist: What about that, Admiral?
CB: Looks very good to me.
mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out
in their spare time, in a less serious vein, for a Sunday afternoon. (Music)
the video display, pointing a gun. It lead to the microcomputer,
but unfortunately, it was too pricey for the Navy,
and all of this would have been lost
if it weren't for a happy coincidence.
We're threatened by the greatest weapon ever,
and knowing a good thing when it sees it,
the Air Force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us.
They adapt Whirlwind to a massive air defense system,
deploy it all across the frozen north,
and spend nearly three times as much on this computer
as was spent on the Manhattan Project
building the A-Bomb in the first place.
Talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry.
And you can imagine that the Air Force became a pretty good salesman.
Here's their marketing video.
before we could determine their tracks.
And then it would be too late to act.
We cannot afford to take that chance.
It is to meet this threat that the Air Force has been developing SAGE,
the Semi-Automatic Ground Environment system,
to strengthen our air defenses.
This new computer, built to become the nerve center of a defense network,
is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems
involved in countering a mass enemy raid.
It is provided with its own powerhouse
containing large diesel-driven generators,
air-conditioning equipment, and cooling towers
required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer.
There's an interesting marketing lesson from it,
which is basically, when you market a product,
you can either say, this is going to be wonderful,
it will make you feel better and enliven you.
Or there's one other marketing proposition: if you don't use our product, you'll die.
This is a really good example of that.
so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems --
so all these things could talk to each other.
About 20 percent of all the nation's programmers were wrapped up in this thing,
and it led to an awful lot of what we have today. It also used vacuum tubes.
You saw how huge it was, and to give you a sense for this --
because we've talked a lot about Moore's law and making things small
at this conference, so let's talk about making things large.
If we took Whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know,
say, Century City, it would fit beautifully.
You'd kind of have to take Century City out, but it could fit in there.
the latest Core 2 Extreme, which is a four-core processor
that Intel's working on, it will be our laptop tomorrow.
To build that, what we'd do with Whirlwind technology is
we'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to Mulholland,
and from the 405 to La Cienega just with those Whirlwinds.
And then, the 92 nuclear power plants
that it would take to provide the power
would fill up the rest of Los Angeles.
That's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of France creates.
So, the next time they tell you they're on to something, clearly they're not.
So -- and we haven't even worked out the cooling needs.
But it gives you the kind of power that people have, that the audience has,
and the reasons these transformations are happening.
DEC kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer.
It shows up at places like MIT, and then a mutation happens.
Spacewar! is built, the first computer game, and all of a sudden,
interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out.
Actually, many MIT students stayed up all night long working on this thing,
and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out.
DEC knew a good thing about wasting time.
It shipped every one of its computers with that game.
the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema
has been busted completely.
A new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls
and they're quite certain that television is about to do them in.
In fact, despair is in the air.
And a quote that sounds largely reminiscent
from everything I've been reading all week.
RCA had David Sarnoff, who basically commercialized radio,
said this, "I don't say that radio networks must die.
Every effort has been made and will continue to be made
to find a new pattern, new selling arrangements
and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues.
It may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio,
but I don't know how."
And of course, as the computer industry develops interactively,
producers in the emerging TV business actually hit on the same idea.
And they fake it.
up on the set, you just get them out.
First of all, get your Winky Dink kits out.
Put out your Magic Window and your erasing glove, and rub it like this.
That's the way we get some of the magic into it, boys and girls.
Then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set,
and rub it out from the center to the corners, like this.
Make sure you keep your magic crayons handy, your Winky Dink crayons
and your erasing glove,
because you'll be using them during the show to draw like that.
You all set? OK, let's get right to the first story about Dusty Man.
Come on into the secret lab.
they wanted to sell you the Winky Dink kits.
Those are the Winky Dink crayons. I know what you're saying.
"Pete, I could use any ordinary open-source crayon,
why do I have to buy theirs?"
I assure you, that's not the case.
Turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons
you should ever use with your Winky Dink Magic Window,
other crayons may discolor or hurt the window.
This proprietary principle of vendor lock-in
would go on to be perfected with great success
as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere.
It led to lawsuits --
and that's a scandal we won't discuss today.
went on to become the host of "Twenty One," one of the most important quiz shows ever.
And it was rigged, and it became unraveled when this man,
Charles van Doren, was outed after an unnatural winning streak,
ending Berry's career.
And actually, ending the career of a lot of people at CBS.
It turns out there was a lot to learn
about how this new medium worked.
and were trying to understand the media,
there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from,
Professor Marshall McLuhan.
He actually understood something about a theme
that we've been discussing all week. It's the role of the audience
in an era of pervasive electronic communications.
Here he is talking from the 1960s.
of making the ad, then it's happy. It's like the old quiz shows.
They were great TV because it gave the audience a role, something to do.
They were horrified when they discovered
they'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged.
Now, then, this was a horrible misunderstanding of TV
on the part of the programmers.
If you substitute the word blogosphere, of the Internet today,
it is very true that his understanding is probably
very enlightening now. Let's listen in to him.
in which you don't necessarily have harmony.
You have extreme concern with everybody else's business
and much involvement in everybody else's life.
It's a sort of Ann Landers' column writ large.
And it doesn't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet,
but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else's affairs.
And so the global village is as big as a planet,
and as small as a village post office.
We're now right into the 1960s.
It's the era of big business and data centers for computing.
But all that was about to change.
You know, the expression of technology
reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in.
And when I say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations,
it's not just a joke about messianism, it's actually what we do.
But for this part of the story, I'd actually like to throw it
to America's leading technology correspondent, John Markoff.
in drugs, sex, rock 'n' roll and the anti-war movement
had to do with computing? Everything.
It all happened within five miles of where I'm standing,
at Stanford University, between 1960 and 1975.
In the midst of revolution in the streets
and rock and roll concerts in the parks,
a group of researchers led by people like John McCarthy,
a computer scientist at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab,
and Doug Engelbart, a computer scientist at SRI, changed the world.
Engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture,
but while he was beginning to do his work,
all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula.
There was LSD leaking out of Kesey's Veterans' Hospital experiments
and other areas around the campus,
and there was music literally in the streets.
The Grateful Dead was playing in the pizza parlors.
People were leaving to go back to the land.
There was the Vietnam War. There was black liberation.
There was women's liberation.
This was a remarkable place, at a remarkable time.
And into that ferment came the microprocessor.
They saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment
as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use
by these communities that they were trying to build.
And most importantly, they had this ethos of sharing information.
I think these ideas are difficult to understand,
because when you're trapped in one paradigm,
the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense.
The stories were so compelling that I decided to write a book about them.
The title of the book is, "What the Dormouse Said:
How the '60s Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry."
The title was taken from the lyrics
to a Jefferson Airplane song. The lyrics go,
"Remember what the dormouse said.
Feed your head, feed your head, feed your head." (Music)
and in short order much of what we're doing today was imagined
in Cambridge and Silicon Valley.
Here's the Architecture Machine Group,
the predecessor of the Media Lab, in 1981.
Meanwhile, in California, we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff.
HyperCard was the first program
to introduce the public to hyperlinks,
where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture,
or piece of text, or data across a file system,
and we had no way of explaining it.
There was no metaphor. Was it a database?
A prototyping tool? A scripted language?
Heck, it was everything. So we ended up writing a marketing brochure.
and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant.
A few years later, we then hit on the idea
of explaining to people the secret of, how do you get the content you want,
the way you want it and the easy way?
Here's the Apple marketing video.
to create a HyperCard interactive video.
The most involved method is to go ahead
and produce your own videodisc
as well as build your own HyperCard stacks.
By far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc
and HyperCard stacks from a commercial supplier.
The method we illustrate in this video
uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom HyperCard stacks.
This method allows you to use existing videodisc materials
in ways which suit your specific needs and interests.
That's like a Dick Cheney speech.
You think he's a nice balding guy, but he's just declared war
on the content business. Find the commercial stuff,
mash it up, tell the story your way.
Now, as long as we confine this to the education market,
and a personal matter between the computer and the file system,
that's fine, but as you can see, it was about to leap out and upset Jack Valenti
and a lot of other people.
that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network.
A few years later, Tim Berners-Lee worked that out.
It became a killer app of links, and today, of course,
we call that the World Wide Web.
Now, not only was I instrumental in helping Apple miss the Internet,
but a couple of years later, I helped Bill Gates do the same thing.
The year is 1993
and he was working on a book and I was working on a video
to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this.
We were plenty aware that we were messing with media,
and on the surface, it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things,
but we also missed an awful lot. Let's take a look.
and TV dinners, ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all.
Yet each pales to insignificance with the completion
of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology,
the Digital Superhighway.
Once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians.
The Digital Highway arrived in America's living rooms late in the twentieth century.
Let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible.
The Digital Highway would follow the rutted trail
first blazed by Alexander Graham Bell.
Though some were incredulous ... Man 1: The phone company!
Narrator: Stirred by the prospects of mass communication
and making big bucks on advertising,
David Sarnoff commercializes radio.
Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
Narrator: The medium introduced America to new products.
Voice 1: Say, mom, Windows for Radio means more enjoyment
and greater ease of use for the whole family.
Be sure to enjoy Windows for Radio at home and at work.
Narrator: In 1939, the Radio Corporation of America introduced television.
Man 2: Never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand.
with the breakup of the telephone company.
And further stimulus came
with the deregulation of the cable television industry,
and the re-regulation of the cable television industry.
Ted Turner: We did the work to build this, this cable industry,
now the broadcasters want some of our money. I mean, it's ridiculous.
Narrator: Computers, once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks,
escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas.
The world and all its culture reduced to bits,
the lingua franca of all media.
And the forces of convergence exploded.
Telecommunications, entertainment, computing and everything else.
Man 3: We'll see channels for the gourmet
and we'll see channels for the pet lover.
Voice 2: Next on the gourmet pet channel,
decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer.
Narrator: All of industry was in play, as investors flocked to place their bets.
At stake: the battle for you, the consumer,
and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of America. (Music)
the long tail, the role of the audience, open systems, social networks.
It just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media.
Thomas Edison had the same problem.
He wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it,
and kind of only one of his ideas
turned out to have been the right early idea.
Well, you know where we're going on from here.
We come into the era of the dotcom, the World Wide Web,
and I don't need to tell you about that
because we all went through that bubble together.
But when we emerge from this and what we call Web 2.0,
things actually are quite different.
And I think it's the reason that TV's so challenged.
If Internet one was about pages, now it's about people.
It's a customer, it's an audience, it's a person who's participating.
It's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now.
we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in.
That's about 2,700 fresh, connective links
across about 112 million blogs that are out there.
And it's no wonder that as we head into the writers' strike, odd things happen.
You know, it reminds me of that old saw in Hollywood,
that a producer is anyone who knows a writer.
I now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem.
But it's not a joke. This is a real headline.
"Websites attract striking writers:
operators of sites like MyDamnChannel.com
could benefit from labor disputes."
Meanwhile, you have the TV bloggers going out on strike,
in sympathy with the television writers.
And then you have TV Guide, a Fox property,
which is about to sponsor the online video awards --
but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television,
not appearing to gloat.
To show you how schizophrenic this all is,
here's the head of MySpace, or Fox Interactive, a News Corp company,
being asked, well, with the writers' strike,
isn't this going to hurt News Corp and help you online?
there's an opportunity for more people to experience
video on places like MySpace TV.
as part of Fox Entertainment Group.
Obviously, we hope that the strike is --
that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible.
the globalization of content really is happening.
Here is a clip from a video, from a piece of animation
that was written by a writer in Hollywood,
animation worked out in Israel, farmed out to Croatia and India,
and it's now an international series.
in the months preceding the presidential primaries.
until we get word the terrorist threat is over.
Voices 2, 3 and 4: With her?
Voice 2: Well, there goes the neighborhood.
of where this is headed. Traditional TV animation costs, say,
between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute.
They're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute.
And they're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end,
in a much more entrepreneurial manner. So, it's a different model.
What the entertainment business is struggling with,
the world of brands is figuring out.
it's a network to hook its customers together.
And the head of marketing at Nike says, "People are coming to our site
an average of three times a week. We don't have to go to them."
Which means television advertising is down 57 percent for Nike.
Or, as Nike's head of marketing says,
"We're not in the business of keeping media companies alive.
We're in the business of connecting with consumers."
Here's a man announcing the new Market Watch from Dow Jones,
powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page --
user-generated content married up with traditional content.
It turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them.
Or, as Geoffrey Moore once told me,
it's intellectual curiosity that's the trade that brands need
in the age of the blogosphere.
And I think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business.
who just wrote "The Color Purple" and has been an R and --
rhythm and blues writer, and this is what she said
about where songwriting's going.
because to look at them strictly as spam
is missing what this medium is about.
who, 40 years ago, was dealing with audiences
that were going through just as much change,
and I think that, today, traditional Hollywood and the writers
are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before.
But I don't need to tell you this, let's throw it back to him.
MM: The medium does things to people
and they are always completely unaware of this.
They don't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up.
They think of the old medium,
because the old medium is always the content of the new medium,
as movies tend to be the content of TV,
and as books used to be the content,
novels used to be the content of movies.
And so every time a new medium arrives,
the old medium is the content, and it is highly observable,
highly noticeable, but the real, real roughing up and massaging
is done by the new medium, and it is ignored.
There's been more raw DNA of communications and media
thrown out there. Content is moving from shows to particles
that are batted back and forth, and part of social communications,
and I think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity.
And whereas television may have gotten beat up,
what's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication,
and we kind of have the merger of the two industries
and a new way of thinking to look at it.
You hear that this is the era of environment -- or biology, or information technology ...
it's the era of change. There's more change going on
than ever has occurred in the history of human life on earth.
And you all sort of know it, but it's hard to get it
so that you really understand it.
And I've tried to put together something that's a good start for this.
I've tried to show in this -- though the color doesn't come out --
that what I'm concerned with is the little 50-year time bubble
that you are in. You tend to be interested in a generation past,
a generation future -- your parents, your kids, things you can change
over the next few decades -- and this 50-year time bubble
you kind of move along in. And in that 50 years,
if you look at the population curve, you find the population of humans
on the earth more than doubles and we're up three-and-a-half times
since I was born. When you have a new baby,
by the time that kid gets out of high school
more people will be added than existed on earth when I was born.
This is unprecedented, and it's big.
Where it goes in the future is questioned. So that's the human part.
What I call the human portion -- humans and their livestock and pets --
versus the natural portion -- all the other wild animals and just --
these are vertebrates and all the birds, etc.,
in the land and air, not in the water. How does it balance?
Certainly, 10,000 years ago, the civilization's beginning,
the human portion was less than one tenth of one percent. Let's look at it now.
You follow this curve and you see the whiter spot in the middle --
that's your 50-year time bubble. Humans, livestock and pets
are now 97 percent of that integrated total mass on earth
and all wild nature is three percent. We have won. The next generation
doesn't even have to worry about this game -- it is over.
And the biggest problem came in the last 25 years:
it went from 25 percent up to that 97 percent.
And this really is a sobering picture upon realizing that we, humans,
are in charge of life on earth; we're like the capricious Gods
of old Greek myths, kind of playing with life --
and not a great deal of wisdom injected into it.
This is Moore's Law plotted here, which relates to density
of information, but it has been pretty good for showing
a lot of other things about information technology --
computers, their use, Internet, etc. And what's important
is it just goes straight up through the top of the curve,
and has no real limits to it. Now try and contrast these.
This is the size of the earth going through that same --
(Laughter)
-- frame. And to make it really clear, I've put all four on one graph.
There's no need to see the little detailed words on it.
That first one is humans-versus-nature;
we've won, there's no more gain. Human population.
And so if you're looking for growth industries to get into,
that's not a good one -- protecting natural creatures. Human population
is going up; it's going to continue for quite a while.
Good business in obstetricians, morticians, and farming, housing, etc. --
they all deal with human bodies, which require being fed,
transported, housed and so on. And the information technology,
which connects to our brains, has no limit -- now, that is a wonderful
field to be in. You're looking for growth opportunity?
It's just going up through the roof.
And then, the size of the Earth. Somehow making these all compatible
with the Earth looks like a pretty bad industry to be involved with.
for reasons I don't understand, I really do have a goal.
And the goal is that the world be desirable and sustainable
when my kids reach my age -- and I think that's -- in other words,
the next generation. I think that's a goal that we probably all share.
I think it's a hopeless goal. Technologically, it's achievable;
economically, it's achievable; politically,
it means sort of the habits, institutions of people -- it's impossible.
The institutions of the past with all their inertia
are just irrelevant for the future, except they're there
and we have to deal with them. I spend about 15 percent of my time
trying to save the world, the other 85 percent, the usual --
and whatever else we devote ourselves to.
And in that 15 percent, the main focus is on human mind, thinking skills,
somehow trying to unleash kids from the straightjacket of school,
which is putting information and dogma into them,
get them so they really think, ask tough questions, argue
about serious subjects, don't believe everything that's in the book,
think broadly or creative. They can be.
Our school systems are very flawed and do not reward you
for the things that are important in life
or for the survival of civilization; they reward you
for a lot of learning and sopping up stuff.
We can't go into that today because there isn't time --
it's a broad subject. One thing for sure, in the future
there is an essential feature -- necessary, but not sufficient --
which is doing more with less. We've got to be doing things
with more efficiency using less energy, less material.
Your great-great grandparents got by on muscle power,
and yet we all think there's this huge power that's essential
for our lifestyle. And with all the wonderful technology we have
we can do things that are much more efficient: conserve, recycle, etc.
Human-powered airplane -- Gossamer Condor sort of started me
in this direction in 1976 and 77,
winning the Kremer prize in aviation history,
followed by the Albatross. And we began
making various odd planes and creatures.
Here's a giant flying replica of a pterosaur that has no tail.
Trying to have it fly straight is like trying to shoot an arrow
with the feathered end forward. It was a tough job,
and boy it made me have a lot of respect for nature.
This was the full size of the original creature.
We did things on land, in the air, on water --
vehicles of all different kinds, usually with some electronics
or electric power systems in them. I find they're all the same,
whether its land, air or water.
I'll be focusing on the air here. This is a solar-powered airplane --
165 miles carrying a person from France to England
as a symbol that solar power is going to be an important part
of our future. Then we did the solar car for General Motors --
the Sunracer -- that won the race in Australia.
We got a lot of people thinking about electric cars,
what you could do with them. A few years later, when we suggested to GM that
now is the time and we could do a thing called the Impact,
they sponsored it, and here's the Impact that we developed with them
on their programs. This is the demonstrator. And they put huge effort
into turning it into a commercial product.
which shows a little airplane for surveillance
and moving to a giant airplane.
Narrator: A tiny airplane, the AV Pointer serves for surveillance --
in effect, a pair of roving eyeglasses. A cutting-edge example
of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote
from the vehicle. It is convenient to carry, assemble
and launch by hand. Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
With onboard GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
The modern sailplane is superbly efficient.
Some can glide as flat as 60 feet forward for every foot of descent.
They are powered only by the energy
they can extract from the atmosphere --
an atmosphere nature stirs up by solar energy.
Humans and soaring birds have found nature to be generous
in providing replenishable energy. Sailplanes have flown
over 1,000 miles, and the altitude record is over 50,000 feet.
(Music)
The Solar Challenger was made to serve as a symbol
that photovoltaic cells can produce real power
and will be part of the world's energy future.
In 1981, it flew 163 miles from Paris to England,
solely on the power of sunbeams,
and established a basis for the Pathfinder.
(Music)
The message from all these vehicles is that ideas and technology
can be harnessed to produce remarkable gains in doing more with less --
gains that can help us attain a desirable balance
between technology and nature. The stakes are high
as we speed toward a challenging future.
Buckminster Fuller said it clearly: "there are no passengers
on spaceship Earth, only crew. We, the crew,
can and must do more with less -- much less."
put in as quickly as you can, which -- this will show
the Pathfinder airplane in some flights this past year in Hawaii,
and will show a sequence of some of the beauty behind it
after it had just flown to 71,530 feet --
higher than any propeller airplane has ever flown.
It's amazing: just on the puny power of the sun --
by having a super lightweight plane, you're able to get it up there.
It's part of a long-term program NASA sponsored.
And we worked very closely with the whole thing being a team effort,
and with wonderful results like that flight.
And we're working on a bigger plane -- 220-foot span --
and an intermediate-size, one with a regenerative fuel cell
that can store excess energy during the day, feed it back at night,
and stay up 65,000 feet for months at a time.
(Music)
Ray Morgan's voice will come in here.
There he's the project manager. Anything they do
is certainly a team effort. He ran this program. Here's ...
some things he showed as a celebration at the very end.
Ray Morgan: We'd just ended a seven-month deployment of Hawaii.
For those who live on the mainland, it was tough being away from home.
The friendly support, the quiet confidence, congenial hospitality
shown by our Hawaiian and military hosts --
(Music)
this is starting --
made the experience enjoyable and unforgettable.
PM: We have real-time IR scans going out through the Internet
while the plane is flying. And it's exploring
without polluting the stratosphere. That's its goal: the stratosphere,
the blanket that really controls the radiation of the earth
and permits life on earth to be the success that it is --
probing that is very important. And also we consider it
as a sort of poor man's stationary satellite,
because it can stay right overhead for months at a time,
2,000 times closer than the real GFC synchronous satellite.
We couldn't bring one here to fly it and show you.
In the video you saw that nine-pound or eight-pound Pointer airplane
surveillance drone that Keenan has developed
and just done a remarkable job. Where some have servos
that have gotten down to, oh, 18 or 25 grams,
his weigh one-third of a gram. And what he's going to bring out here
is a surveillance drone that weighs about 2 ounces --
that includes the video camera, the batteries that run it,
the telemetry, the receiver and so on. And we'll fly it, we hope,
with the same success that we had last night when we did the practice.
So Matt Keenan, just any time you're --
all right
-- ready to let her go. But first, we're going to make sure
that it's appearing on the screen, so you see what it sees.
You can imagine yourself being a mouse or fly inside of it,
looking out of its camera.
Matt Keenan: It's switched on.
PM: But now we're trying to get the video. There we go.
MK: Can you bring up the house lights?
PM: Yeah, the house lights and we'll see you all better
and be able to fly the plane better.
MK: All right, we'll try to do a few laps around and bring it back in.
Here we go.
(Applause)
PM: The video worked right for the first few and I don't know why it --
there it goes.
Oh, that was only a minute, but I think you'd be safe
to have that near the end of the flight, perhaps.
We get to do the classic.
All right.
If this hits you, it will not hurt you.
(Laughter)
OK.
(Applause)
Thank you very much. Thank you.
(Applause)
we have something much better for you, which we're working on:
planes that are only six inches -- 15 centimeters -- in size.
And Matt's plane was on the cover of Popular Science last month,
showing what this can lead to. And in a while, something this size
will have GPS and a video camera in it. We've had one of these fly
nine miles through the air at 35 miles an hour
with just a little battery in it.
But there's a lot of technology going.
There are just milestones along the way of some remarkable things.
This one doesn't have the video in it,
but you get a little feel from what it can do.
OK, here we go.
(Laughter)
MK: Sorry.
OK.
(Applause)
PM: If you can pass it down when you're done. Yeah, I think --
I lost a little orientation; I looked up into this light.
It hit the building. And the building was poorly placed, actually.
(Laughter)
But you're beginning to see what can be done.
We're working on projects now -- even wing-flapping things
the size of hawk moths -- DARPA contracts, working with Caltech, UCLA.
But like any basic research, when you're really forced to do things
that are way beyond existing technology,
you can get there with micro-technology, nanotechnology.
You can do amazing things when you realize
what nature has been doing all along. As you get to these small scales,
you realize we have a lot to learn from nature -- not with 747s --
but when you get down to the nature's realm,
nature has 200 million years of experience.
It never makes a mistake. Because if you make a mistake,
you don't leave any progeny.
We should have nothing but success stories from nature,
for you or for birds, and we're learning a lot
from its fascinating subjects.
and I have just two final slides to try and put it in perspective.
The first I'll just read. At last, I put in three sentences
and had it say what I wanted.
Over billions of years on a unique sphere, chance has painted
a thin covering of life -- complex, improbable, wonderful
and fragile. Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species,
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --
have grown in population, technology and intelligence
to a position of terrible power. We now wield the paintbrush.
And that's serious: we're not very bright. We're short on wisdom;
we're high on technology. Where's it going to lead?
Every 25 years I do a picture. Here's the one --
tries to show that the world isn't getting any bigger.
Sort of a timeline, very non-linear scale, nature rates
and trilobites and dinosaurs, and eventually we saw some humans
with caves ... Birds were flying overhead, after pterosaurs.
And then we get to the civilization above the little TV set
with a gun on it. Then traffic jams, and power systems,
and some dots for digital. Where it's going to lead -- I have no idea.
And so I just put robotic and natural cockroaches out there,
but you can fill in whatever you want. This is not a forecast.
This is a warning, and we have to think seriously about it.
And that time when this is happening is not 100 years or 500 years.
Things are going on this decade, next decade;
it's a very short time that we have to decide what we are going to do.
And if we can get some agreement on where we want the world to be --
desirable, sustainable when your kids reach your age --
I think we actually can reach it. Now, I said this was a warning,
not a forecast. That was before --
I painted this before we started in on making robotic versions
of hawk moths and cockroaches, and now I'm beginning to wonder
seriously -- was this more of a forecast than I wanted?
I personally think the surviving intelligent life form on earth
is not going to be carbon-based; it's going to be silicon-based.
And so where it all goes, I don't know.
is an utterly impractical flight vehicle,
which is a little ornithopter wing-flapping device that --
rubber-band powered -- that we'll show you.
MK: 32 gram. Sorry, one gram.
PM: Last night we gave it a few too many turns
and it tried to bash the roof out also. It's about a gram.
The tube there's hollow, about paper-thin.
And if this lands on you, I assure you it will not hurt you.
But if you reach out to grab it or hold it, you will destroy it.
So, be gentle, just act like a wooden Indian or something.
And when it comes down -- and we'll see how it goes.
We consider this to be sort of the spirit of TED.
(Applause)
And you wonder, is it practical? And it turns out if I had not been --
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Unfortunately, we have some light bulb changes.
We can probably get it down,
but it's possible it's gone up to a greater destiny up there --
(Laughter)
-- than it ever had. And I wanted to make --
(Applause)
just --
(Applause)
there's nothing to it. And yet if I had not been making ornithopters
like that, a little bit cruder, in 1939 -- a long, long time ago --
there wouldn't have been a Gossamer Condor,
there wouldn't have been an Albatross, a Solar Challenger,
there wouldn't be an Impact car, there wouldn't be a mandate
on zero-emission vehicles in California.
A lot of these things -- or similar -- would have happened some time,
probably a decade later. I didn't realize at the time
I was doing inquiry-based, hands-on things with teams,
like they're trying to get in education systems.
So I think that, as a symbol, it's important.
And I believe that also is important. You can think of it
as a sort of a symbol for learning and TED
that somehow gets you thinking of technology and nature,
and puts it all together in things that are --
that make this conference, I think, more important than any
that's taken place in this country in this decade.
Thank you. (Applause)
Hi. I'm here to talk to you about the importance of
praise, admiration and thank you,
and having it be specific and genuine.
I noticed in myself, when I was growing up,
and until about a few years ago,
that I would want to say thank you to someone,
I would want to praise them,
I would want to take in their praise of me
and I'd just stop it.
And I asked myself, why?
I felt shy, I felt embarrassed.
And then my question became,
am I the only one who does this?
So, I decided to investigate.
so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction.
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as,
their core wound is their father died without ever saying he's proud of them.
But then, they hear from all the family and friends
that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him,
but he never told the son.
It's because he didn't know that his son needed to hear it.
I know a gentleman, married for 25 years,
who's longing to hear his wife say,
"Thank you for being the breadwinner, so I can stay home with the kids,"
but won't ask.
I know a woman who's good at this.
She, once a week, meets with her husband and says,
"I'd really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids."
And he goes, "Oh, this is great, this is great."
And praise really does have to be genuine,
but she takes responsibility for that.
And a friend of mine, April, who I've had since kindergarten,
she thanks her children for doing their chores.
And she said, "Why wouldn't I thank it, even though they're supposed to do it?"
Why were other people blocking it?
Why can I say, "I'll take my steak medium rare,
I need size six shoes," but I won't say,
"Would you praise me this way?"
And it's because I'm giving you critical data about me.
I'm telling you where I'm insecure.
I'm telling you where I need your help.
And I'm treating you, my inner circle,
like you're the enemy.
Because what can you do with that data?
You could neglect me.
You could abuse it.
Or you could actually meet my need.
same bike, and they'd do something called "truing" the wheels.
The guy said, "You know, when you true the wheels,
it's going to make the bike so much better."
I get the same bike back,
and they've taken all the little warps out of those same wheels
I've had for two and a half years, and my bike is like new.
So, I'm going to challenge all of you.
I want you to true your wheels:
be honest about the praise that you need to hear.
What do you need to hear? Go home to your wife --
go ask her, what does she need?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need?
Go home and ask those questions, and then help the people around you.
And why should we care about this?
We talk about world peace.
How can we have world peace with different cultures, different languages?
I think it starts household by household, under the same roof.
So, let's make it right in our own backyard.
And I want to thank all of you in the audience
for being great husbands, great mothers,
friends, daughters, sons.
And maybe somebody's never said that to you,
but you've done a really, really good job.
And thank you for being here, just showing up
and changing the world with your ideas.
(Applause)
So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories
in some unconventional ways.
This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested
in collecting imaginary stories.
So this is a picture of me
holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.
And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories
from reality -- so, real stories.
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,
stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,
which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.
So I'll be talking about each of those today.
So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.
I have many of these books,
and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.
They accompany me wherever I go in my life,
and I fill them with all sorts of things,
records of my lived experience:
so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,
dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,
business cards, writings.
And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses
of moments and experiences and people that I meet.
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,
I started to become very interested in collecting
not only my own personal artifacts,
but also the artifacts of other people.
So, I started collecting found objects.
This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City
about 10 years ago.
On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,
and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.
Have fun in whatever you do."
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.
As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,
and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.
And that idea of a partial glimpse is something
that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,
and I noticed that it was suddenly possible
to collect these sorts of personal artifacts,
not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores
of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.
Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,
all of these things were being expressed by people online,
and leaving behind trails.
So, I started to write computer programs
that study very, very large sets of these online footprints.
One such project is about a year and a half old.
It's called "We Feel Fine."
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries
every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases
"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,
it grabs the full sentence up to the period
and also tries to identify demographic information about the author.
So, their gender, their age, their geographic location
and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day
and it's been running for about a year and a half,
having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.
This is, then, how they're presented.
These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's
feelings from the last few hours,
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,
so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.
And the diameter of each dot corresponds
to the length of the sentence inside.
So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse
for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"
from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.
"I got this on some trading locally,
but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."
Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.
And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,
which consist of the sentence and images being combined.
And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.
"I feel good."
"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,
but it was worth it."
"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything
that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,
man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."
So the next movement is called mobs.
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.
This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,
dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.
Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits
of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,
the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,
and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots
on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."
These are the images that are automatically constructed.
"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."
(Laughter)
"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,
the kisses felt messy and wrong,
but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."
"I can feel my cancer grow."
"I feel pretty."
"I feel skinny, but I'm not."
"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,
and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."
"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,
because I feel the need for speed."
(Laughter)
"I feel sassy."
"I feel so sexy in this new wig."
As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects
very, very small-scale personal stories.
Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.
So, really even challenging the notion
of what can be considered a story.
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.
And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,
not with the Internet,
and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.
So these are some newer projects that
actually aren't even launched publicly yet.
The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,
the northernmost settlement in the United States,
with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,
camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.
And that water that you see there is the open lead,
and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,
waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,
it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up
under the ice, and cuts it up.
And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.
So I went up there, and I lived with these guys
out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,
and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.
So every five minutes, I took a photograph.
When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.
And then in moments of high adrenaline,
like when something exciting was happening,
I would up that photographic frequency to as many as
37 photographs in five minutes.
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat
that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.
That was the first concept here.
The second concept was to use this experience to think about
the fundamental components of any story.
What are the things that make up a story?
So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.
They have colors. What do they look like?
They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?
And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums
that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,
photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,
some kind of omniscient, external body
through whose eyes you see the story.
We're very used to this.
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,
and there's all of these overlapping stories
intersecting and touching each other.
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework
to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"
how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,
with an excitement level of high?
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.
This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,
and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper
in the basement apartment where I was staying.
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.
You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.
These are organized chronologically.
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,
so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.
And any of these can be clicked,
and then the narrative is entered at that position.
So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.
That's "Moby Dick."
This is the food we ate.
This is in the Patkotak's family living room
in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.
This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.
This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be
reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,
showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"
and the two whales that were killed down here.
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,
extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood
and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.
And now we've whittled down that whole story
to just 29 matching photographs,
and then we can enter the narrative at that position.
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.
These whales are about 40 feet long,
and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source
for the community for much of the year.
Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,
and an incredibly efficient process.
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.
This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.
It's baleen. Moving on.
So what I'm going to tell you about next
is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,
I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom
nestled between Tibet and India.
And I was doing a project there about happiness,
interviewing a lot of local people.
So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base
most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept
of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,
and they've been doing this since the '70s.
And it leads to just a completely different value system.
It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,
where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,
and took a number of set photographs,
and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons
and give them that number of balloons to hold.
So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,
and some really sad soul holding one balloon.
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.
(Laughter)
And then I would ask them a number of questions like
what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.
And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.
And when they made a wish, I would write their wish
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets
of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.
This is an 11-year-old student.
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,
and they all had plastic toy guns.
His wish was to become a police officer.
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.
I took pictures of everybody's hands,
because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody
from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,
and asked everybody to make a funny face.
A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.
She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,
and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.
If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand
how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.
He wanted to help poor people.
A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,
and that pile of wheat behind her
had taken her about a week to make.
She wanted to keep farming until she dies.
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,
and she'd found it in the road somewhere.
A 16-year-old quarry worker.
This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,
but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.
A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.
He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,
which I'm told is very good luck.
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.
A 16-year-old student.
She wanted to become an independent woman.
I asked her about that, and she said she meant
that she doesn't want to be married,
because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,
your chances to live an independent life kind of end,
and so she had no interest in that.
A 24-year-old truck driver.
There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks
that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,
with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,
and he was driving one of these trucks.
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.
She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.
Her wish was to marry someone with a car.
She wanted a change in her life.
She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,
and she wanted a different lot on things.
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.
I saw this guy on the side of the road,
and he actually doesn't have a home.
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,
and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.
So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.
He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho
and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.
It was all good-natured.
A 10-year-old.
He wanted to join a school and learn to read,
but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.
He was eating this orange, sugary candy
that he kept dipping his fingers into,
and since there was so much saliva on his hands,
this orange paste started to form on his palms.
(Laughter)
A 37-year-old road worker.
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan
is the use of Indian cheap labor
that they import from India to build the roads,
and then they send these people home once the roads are built.
So these guys were in a worker's gang
mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.
His wish was to make some money and open a store.
A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.
I asked her about her wish, and she said,
"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."
She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth
over the years to turn very red.
Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,
"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,
but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."
And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."
And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"
And she said, "Well, you know,
I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --
with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --
that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into
on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.
But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.
I asked her a little bit more about the cave
and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.
What if she saw the truth after just one year,
what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?
And this is what she said.
Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.
Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.
JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.
Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die
within one year, or something like that.
JH: Are you hoping to?
Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.
JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --
would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,
or to live for one year?
Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.
JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.
JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.
Woman: Thank you.
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.
So thank you again, so much.
Woman: You're most welcome.
JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die
when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.
So, the last thing we did, very quickly,
is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,
117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,
which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,
one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.
And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags
that people have spread out over the years.
And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,
and hung them up there among the prayer flags.
And they're actually still flying up there today.
So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,
you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.
We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.
You can start to see some familiar balloons here.
"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.
Thanks very much.
(Applause)
There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world
and at IDEO this past year,
and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.
when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;
it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.
those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --
certainly technological objects.
And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you
who are in the audience were my clients.
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth
and we'd put it on the conference table,
and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah."
That was a really good time.
And if you were here last year,
I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,
which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.
And I took a lot of pictures last year;
very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.
This year -- maybe you could show the slides --
this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with
and helped Handspring design it.
Also, though we designed it a few years ago --
it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --
Lots of lives are being saved by those.
And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product
that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.
So, we really will continue to focus on products.
and that's that people like us --
I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,
but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of
human-centeredness in an approach to design.
That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.
And I think you're starting to see that,
and it's making our job even more enjoyable.
you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.
Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.
But firms like ours are having to move to a point where
we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,
showing how they'll be used.
And so in order to do that we've been forming
internal video-production groups
in order to make these kind of experience prototypes
that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.
And it's a much better way to see.
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,
as opposed to them being empty.
to show off this new, broader definition
of design in products and services and environments.
I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute
or a minute-and-a-half apiece --
but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our
work over the last year, and how it responds in video.
and OMA to help us conceive the technology
that's in their retail store in New York.
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --
a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.
And that meant actually designing custom technology
as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.
there's the staff devices that are all around the store.
You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,
the staff person can scan them in
and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.
And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --
so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.
We can put that up on a touch screen
It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here
of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.
there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,
"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"
But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.
So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.
And then one of my favorite features of the technology
is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.
There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --
but there's a three second delay.
So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.
(Applause)
an installation in the museum --
this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,
and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.
And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,
designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.
I don't know if anybody's seen this --
it's pretty spectacular in the room.
the goal is to bring some of the feedback
that the people who had gone to the museum were giving,
and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.
So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,
the little trains go around with what you're thinking about.
And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.
mostly teenagers coming out of there --
there's this big open space that has these tables in it
that have interactive games which are quite fun,
male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby
or what a driverless car might be like.
There's lots of room, so people can come up
and understand what it is before they get involved.
after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits
and go off into the atmosphere.
This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.
Scott Adams ran into us
and asked us if we wouldn't help to design
the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,
which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.
He's always been interested in technology in the future.
for the computer and for family photos.
In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive
and actually give Dilbert a group hug.
(Laughter)
Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)
So you feel that in your cubicle.
and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.
or something to be aggressive with to release tension.
that stretches across your cubicle.
the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,
as well as wastewater.
So this building actually celebrates the water
In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's
And then you would wander around and gather information,
in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process
and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water
once it comes through the plant.
And then, if you saw,
the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information
on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual
recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.
You can see: there's the plant.
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.
started by Nigel Jagger in London.
actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water
and actually seeing what's there,
and enjoying what scuba divers do.
This product, it has two cameras.
You throw it over the side of your boat
and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.
so that the interface doesn't get in your way.
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --
of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.
And the other one was to design the object
and [we're] just ready to start building them.
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,
and is equipped with powerful lights.
It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.
and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.
that indicate your depth and compass heading.
(Applause)
which is a project that I'm very excited about.
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,
who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.
He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright
and he had a very interesting insight, which is that
he said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;
there must be entrepreneurs everywhere."
And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there
they could find enough money to put something together.
So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya
And to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --
he's started 19,000 companies.
He's made 30,000 new jobs.
And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --
the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.
This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.
deep-well, low-cost manual pumps
in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land
to be able to grow crops in the off-season.
And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --
she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college
and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.
and so --
(Laughter)
-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day
and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.
(Laughter)
Can you read it?
(Laughter)
Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.
You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,
and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
and from all the different presenters.
And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,
and I think this is great.
Designers are more trusted and more integrated
into the business strategy of companies,
You might be wondering why I'm wearing sunglasses,
and one answer to that is, because I'm here to talk about glamour.
So, we all think we know what glamour is. Here it is.
It's glamorous movie stars, like Marlene Dietrich.
And it comes in a male form, too --
very glamorous.
Not only can he shoot, drive, drink -- you know, he drinks wine,
there actually is a little wine in there --
and of course, always wears a tuxedo.
But I think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning --
one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters,
but also comes in other forms.
Well, it's certainly not this one.
This is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it's all about sex tips.
Sex tips are not glamorous.
And Drew Barrymore, for all her wonderful charm,
is not glamorous either.
But there is a glamour of industry.
This is Margaret Bourke-White's --
one of her pictures she did.
Fantastic, glamorous pictures
of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places.
And there's the mythic glamour
of the garage entrepreneur.
This is the Hewlett-Packard garage.
We know everyone who starts a business in a garage
ends up founding Hewlett-Packard.
There's the glamour of physics.
What could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe,
grand unification? And, by the way, it helps if you're Brian Greene --
he has other kinds of glamour.
This is very, very glamorous: the glamour of outer space --
and not the alien-style glamour,
but the nice, clean, early '60s version.
So what do we mean by glamour?
Well, one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means
is you can look in the dictionary.
And it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary,
in this case the 1913 dictionary.
Because for centuries, glamour had a very particular meaning,
and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it.
You had "a" glamour.
It wasn't glamour as a quality -- you "cast a glamour."
Glamour was a literal magic spell.
Not a metaphorical one, the way we use it today,
but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies
and to some extent, Celtic magic.
And over the years, around the turn of the 20th century,
it started to take on this other kind of deception --
this definition for any artificial interest in, or association with,
an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified.
But still, glamour is an illusion.
Glamour is a magic spell.
And there's something dangerous about glamour
throughout most of history. When the witches cast a magic spell
on you, it was not in your self-interest --
it was to get you to act against your interest.
glamour came to have this different meaning associated with Hollywood.
And this is Hedy Lamarr.
Hedy Lamarr said, "Anyone can look glamorous,
all you have to do is sit there and look stupid." (Laughter)
But in fact, with all due respect to Hedy --
about whom we'll hear more later -- there's a lot more to it.
There was a tremendous amount of technical achievement
associated with creating this Hollywood glamour.
There were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts.
You can go to the museum of Hollywood history in Hollywood
and see Max Factor's special rooms that he painted different colors
depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up.
So you've got this highly stylized portrait of something
that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star.
And actually, we see glamorized photos of stars all the time --
they call them false color.
but falsification to achieve a particular purpose.
It may be to illuminate the star; it may be to sell a film.
And it involves a great deal of technique.
It's not -- glamour is not something --
you don't wake up in the morning glamorous. I don't care who you are.
Even Nicole Kidman doesn't wake up in the morning glamorous.
There is a process of "idealization, glorification and dramatization,"
and it's not just the case for people.
Glamour doesn't have to be people.
Architectural photography --
Julius Schulman, who has talked about transfiguration,
took this fabulous, famous picture of the Kauffman House.
Architectural photography is extremely glamorous.
It puts you into this special, special world.
This is Alex Ross's comic book art,
which appears to be extremely realistic,
as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art.
Except that light doesn't work this way in the real world.
the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground --
but not in the world of glamour.
What glamour is all about -- I took this from a blurb
in the table of contents of New York magazine,
which was telling us that glamour is back --
glamour is all about transcending the everyday.
And I think that that's starting to get at what the core
that combines all sorts of glamour is.
This is Filippino Lippi's 1543 portrait of Saint Apollonia.
And I don't know who she is either,
but this is the [16th] century equivalent of a supermodel.
It's a very glamorous portrait.
Why is it glamorous?
It's glamorous, first, because she is beautiful --
but that does not make you glamorous,
that only makes you beautiful.
She is graceful, she is mysterious and she is transcendent,
and those are the central qualities of glamour.
You don't see her eyes; they're looking downward.
She's not looking away from you exactly,
but you have to mentally imagine her world.
She's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world
to which she belongs, where she can be completely tranquil
while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture.
Mel Gibson's "Passion Of The Christ" -- not glamorous.
That's glamour:
that's Michelangelo's "Pieta," where Mary is the same age as Jesus
and they're both awfully happy and pleasant.
It has to simultaneously be mysterious, a little bit distant --
that's why, often in these glamour shots,
the person is not looking at the audience,
it's why sunglasses are glamorous --
but also not so far above us that we can't identify with the person.
In some sense, there has to be something like us.
So as I say, in religious art, you know, God is not glamorous.
God cannot be glamorous because God is omnipotent,
omniscient -- too far above us.
And yet you will see in religious art, saints or the Virgin Mary
will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms.
As I said earlier, glamour does not have to be about people,
but it has to have this transcendent quality.
What is it about Superman?
Aside from Alex Ross's style, which is very glamorous,
one thing about Superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly.
and getting to an idealized, perfect place.
And this is one reason that modes of transportation
tend to be extremely glamorous.
The less experience we have with them,
the more glamorous they are.
So you can do a glamorized picture of a car,
but you can't do a glamorized picture of traffic.
You can do a glamorized picture of an airplane, but not the inside.
The notion is that it's going to transport you,
and the story is not about, you know, the guy in front of you in the airplane,
who has this nasty little kid, or the big cough.
The story is about where you're arriving,
or thinking about where you're arriving.
And this sense of being transported
is one reason that we have glamour styling.
This sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous
because we associate it with movies of that period, but because,
in it's streamlining, it transports us from the everyday.
Arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous.
Staircases that curve away from you are glamorous.
I happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous
because, to me, it captures the whole promise
of the academic contemplative life --
but maybe that's because I went to Princeton.
Anyway, skylines are super glamorous,
city streets -- not so glamorous.
You know, when you get, actually to this town it has reality.
The horizon, the open road, is very, very glamorous.
There are few things more glamorous than the horizon --
except, possibly, multiple horizons.
Of course, here you don't feel the cold, or the heat --
you just see the possibilities.
In order to pull glamour off, you need this Renaissance quality
of sprezzatura, which is a term coined by Castiglione
in his book, "The Book Of The Courtier."
There's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today,
after a few centuries.
It makes things look effortless.
You don't think about how Nicole Kidman is maneuvering that dress --
she just looks completely natural.
And I remember reading, after the Lara Croft movies,
Of course, they covered that with make-up,
because Lara Croft did all those same stunts --
but she doesn't get black and blue, because she has sprezzatura.
"To conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort":
And this is one of the critical aspects of glamour.
Glamour is about editing.
How do you create the sense of transcendence,
the sense of evoking a perfect world?
The sense of, you know, life could be better, I could join this --
I could be a perfect person, I could join this perfect world.
We don't tell you all the grubby details.
This is underneath Jeff's desk.
This is what the real world of computers,
lamps, electrical appliances of all kinds, looks like.
But if you look in a catalog --
particularly a catalog of modern, beautiful objects for your home --
it looks like this.
There are no cords.
Look next time you get these catalogs in your mail --
you can usually figure out where they hid the cord.
But there's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp,
you will live in a world without cords. (Laughter)
And the same thing is true of, if you buy this laptop
or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras,
you don't get to live in the world without cords.
You have to have mystery and you have to have grace.
And there she is -- Grace.
This is the most glamorous picture, I think, ever.
Part of the thing is that, in "Rear Window,"
the question is, is she too glamorous to live in his world?
And the answer is no, but of course it's really just a movie.
because, like sunglasses, it conceals and reveals at the same time.
Translucence is glamorous --
that's why all these people wear pearls.
It's why barware is glamorous. Glamour is translucent --
not transparent, not opaque.
It invites us into the world
but it doesn't give us a completely clear picture.
And I think if Grace Kelly is the most glamorous person,
maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot,
because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous.
It has that sense of going up and away,
and yet you never think about how you would really trip
if you were -- particularly going down.
And of course glass block has that sense of translucence.
So, this session's supposed to be about pure pleasure
but glamour's really partly about meaning.
All individuals and all cultures have ideals
that cannot possibly be realized in reality.
they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other --
whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose
to our lives as cultures and as individuals.
And the way we deal with that is we displace them --
we put them into a golden world, an imagined world,
an age of heroes, the world to come.
And in the life of an individual, we often associate that with some object.
The white picket fence, the perfect house.
The perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen.
You know, you buy that Viking range, this is what your kitchen will look like.
The perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace,
the perfect diamond ring.
The perfect getaway in your perfect car.
This is an interior design firm that is literally called Utopia.
The perfect office --
again, no cords, as far as I can tell.
And certainly, no, it doesn't look a thing like my office.
I mean, there's no paper on the desk.
We want this golden world.
And some people get rich enough,
and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense,
they get to acquire their perfect world.
I don't think accidentally -- in Art Deco style.
That symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home.
This is not always good, because what is your perfect world?
What is your ideal, and also, what has been edited out?
Is it something important?
"The Matrix" is a movie that is all about glamour.
I could do a whole talk on "The Matrix" and glamour.
It was criticized for glamorizing violence,
because, look -- sunglasses and those long coats, and, of course,
they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things
that are impossible in the real world.
This is another Margaret Bourke-White photo.
This is from Soviet Union. Attractive.
I mean, look how happy the people are, and good-looking too.
You know, we're marching toward Utopia.
Because what they're doing is they're saying,
your coat's not so glamorous, what's been edited out is something important.
But actually, what's even more important
than remembering what's been edited out is thinking, are the ideals good?
Because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive.
And it's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor.
This is from "Triumph Of The Will" --
brilliant editing to cut together things.
There's a glamour shot.
National Socialism is all about glamour.
It was a very aesthetic ideology.
It was all about cleaning up Germany, and the West, and the world,
and ridding it of anything unglamorous.
So glamour can be dangerous.
I'm not against glamour.
But there's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life.
And there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour
and a way to broaden your appreciation of it.
And that's to take Isaac Mizrahi's advice
and confront the manipulation of it all,
and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy,
but also enjoy how it happens.
And here's Hedy Lamarr.
She's very glamorous but, you know, she invented spread-spectrum technology.
So she's even more glamorous if you know that she really wasn't stupid,
even though she thought she could look stupid.
very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about
the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash,
which only took a fraction of a second to happen.
There is a book out in the bookstore --
it's called "Symphony In Steel,"
and it's about the stuff that's hidden under the skin of the Disney Center.
And that has a fascination.
It's not necessarily glamorous, but unveiling the glamour has an appeal.
There's a wonderful book called "Crowns"
that's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats.
And there's a quote from one of these women, and she talks about,
"As a little girl, I'd admire women at church with beautiful hats.
They looked like beautiful dolls, like they'd just stepped out of a magazine.
But I also knew how hard they worked all week.
Sometimes under those hats there's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow."
And, actually, you get more appreciation for glamour
when you realize what went into creating it.
Thank you.
I was asked to come here and speak about creation.
And I only have 15 minutes, and I see they're counting already.
And I can -- in 15 minutes, I think I can touch only a very rather janitorial branch of creation,
which I call "creativity."
Creativity is how we cope with creation.
While creation sometimes seems a bit un-graspable, or even pointless,
creativity is always meaningful.
See, for instance, in this picture.
You know, creation is what put that dog in that picture,
and creativity is what makes us see a chicken on his hindquarters.
You know, when I was a teenager, I was a creator.
I just did things.
Then I became an adult and started knowing who I was,
and tried to maintain that persona -- I became creative.
It wasn't until I actually did a book and a retrospective exhibition, that I could track exactly --
looks like all the craziest things that I had done, all my drinking, all my parties --
they followed a straight line that brings me to the point
that actually I'm talking to you at this moment.
Though it's actually true, you know,
the reason I'm talking to you right now is because I was born in Brazil.
If I was born in Monterey, probably would be in Brazil.
under a climate of political distress,
and I was forced to learn to communicate in a very specific way --
in a sort of a semiotic black market.
You couldn't really say what you wanted to say;
you had to invent ways of doing it.
You didn't trust information very much.
That led me to another step of why I'm here today,
is because I really liked media of all kinds.
I was a media junkie, and eventually got involved with advertising.
My first job in Brazil
was actually to develop a way to improve the readability of billboards,
and based on speed, angle of approach and actually blocks of text.
It was very -- actually, it was a very good study,
and got me a job in an ad agency.
And they also decided that I had to --
to give me a very ugly Plexiglas trophy for it.
is that the day I went to pick up the Plexiglas trophy,
I rented a tuxedo for the first time in my life,
picked the thing -- didn't have any friends.
On my way out, I had to break a fight apart.
Somebody was hitting somebody else with brass knuckles.
They were in tuxedos, and fighting. It was very ugly.
And also -- advertising people do that all the time -- (Laughter) --
and I -- well, what happened is when I went back, it was on the way back to my car,
the guy who got hit decided to grab a gun --
I don't know why he had a gun --
and shoot the first person he decided to be his aggressor.
The first person was wearing a black tie, a tuxedo. It was me.
Luckily, it wasn't fatal, as you can all see.
And, even more luckily, the guy said that he was sorry
and I bribed him for compensation money, otherwise I press charges.
And that's how -- with this money I paid for a ticket to come to the United States in 1983,
and that's very -- the basic reason I'm talking to you here today:
because I got shot. (Laughter) (Applause)
You know, I became -- I took this very iconoclastic approach.
Because when I decided to go into advertising, I wanted to do --
I wanted to airbrush naked people on ice, for whiskey commercials,
that's what I really wanted to do. (Laughter)
But I -- they didn't let me do it, so I just -- you know,
they would only let me do other things.
But I wasn't into selling whiskey; I was into selling ice.
The first works were actually objects.
It was kind of a mixture of found object, product design and advertising.
And I called them relics.
They were displayed first at Stux Gallery in 1983.
Is a remnant of a race of -- a very evolved race of entertainers.
They lived in Brazil, long time ago. (Laughter)
This is the Ashanti joystick.
Unfortunately, it has become obsolete because it was designed for Atari platform.
A Playstation II is in the works, maybe for the next TED I'll bring it.
The rocking podium. (Laughter)
This is the pre-Columbian coffeemaker. (Laughter)
Actually, the idea came out of an argument that I had at Starbucks,
that I insisted that I wasn't having Colombian coffee;
the coffee was actually pre-Columbian.
The Bonsai table.
The entire Encyclopedia Britannica bound in a single volume, for travel purposes.
And the half tombstone, for people who are not dead yet.
and I decided to make things that had the same identity conflicts.
So I decided to do work with clouds.
Because clouds can mean anything you want.
But now I wanted to work in a very low-tech way,
so something that would mean at the same time
a lump of cotton, a cloud and Durer's praying hands --
although this looks a lot more like Mickey Mouse's praying hands.
But I was still, you know -- this is a kitty cloud.
They're called "Equivalents," after Alfred Stieglitz's work.
"The Snail."
But I was still working with sculpture,
and I was really trying to go flatter and flatter.
"The Teapot."
and I saw Ghiberti's "Door of Paradise."
And he did something that was very tricky.
He put together two different media from different periods of time.
First, he got an age-old way of making it, which was relief,
and he worked this with three-point perspective, which was brand-new technology at the time.
And it's totally overkill.
And your eye doesn't know which level to read.
And you become trapped into this kind of representation.
So I decided to make these very simple renderings,
that at first they are taken as a line drawing --
you know, something that's very -- and then I did it with wire.
The idea was to -- because everybody overlooks white -- like pencil drawings, you know?
And they would look at it -- "Ah, it's a pencil drawing."
Then you have this double take and see that it's actually something that existed in time.
It had a physicality,
and you start going deeper and deeper into sort of narrative
that goes this way, towards the image. So this is "Monkey with Leica."
"Relaxation."
"Fiat Lux."
evolved from line drawings to shaded drawings.
And I wanted to deal with other subjects.
I started taking that into the realm of landscape,
which is something that's almost a picture of nothing.
I made these pictures called "Pictures of Thread,"
and I named them after the amount of yards that I used to represent each picture.
These always end up being a photograph at the end,
or more like an etching in this case.
So this is a lighthouse.
This is "6,500 Yards," after Corot. "9,000 Yards," after Gerhard Richter.
And I don't know how many yards, after John Constable.
like which is more similar to the type of representation that we find in photographs themselves.
I had met a group of children in the Caribbean island of Saint Kitts,
and I did work and play with them.
I got some photographs from them.
Upon my arrival in New York, I decided --
they were children of sugar plantation workers.
And by manipulating sugar over a black paper, I made portraits of them.
These are -- (Applause) --
Thank you. This is "Valentina, the Fastest."
It was just the name of the child,
with the little thing you get to know of somebody that you meet very briefly.
"Valicia."
"Jacynthe."
Because I was doing this while I was making these pictures,
I realized that I could add still another thing
I was trying to make a subject --
something that would interfere with the themes,
so chocolate is very good, because it has --
it brings to mind ideas that go from scatology to romance.
And so I decided to make these pictures,
and they were very large, so you had to walk away from it to be able to see them.
So they're called "Pictures of Chocolate."
Freud probably could explain chocolate better than I. He was the first subject.
And Jackson Pollock also.
because, you know, you go to that --
you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily,
like a face, goes into becoming just a texture.
"Paparazzi."
I used the dust at the Whitney Museum to render some pieces of their collection.
And I picked minimalist pieces because they're about specificity.
And you render this with the most non-specific material,
which is dust itself.
Like, you know, you have the skin particles of every single museum visitor.
They do a DNA scan of this, they will come up with a great mailing list.
This is Richard Serra.
You know an artist's first response to this is, who counted it? You know?
And I realized that I never worked with color,
because I had a hard time controlling the idea of single colors.
But once they're applied to numeric structure,
then you can feel more comfortable.
So the first time I worked with colors was by making these mosaics of Pantone swatches.
They end up being very large pictures,
and I photographed with a very large camera --
an 8x10 camera.
So you can see the surface of every single swatch --
like in this picture of Chuck Close.
And you have to walk very far to be able to see it.
Also, the reference to Gerhard Richter's use of color charts --
and the idea also entering another realm of representation that's very common to us today,
which is the bit map.
I ended up narrowing the subject to Monet's "Haystacks."
you know, make -- the same like -- Robert Smithson's "Spiral Jetty" --
and then leaving traces, as if it was done on a tabletop.
I tried to prove that he didn't do that thing in the Salt Lake.
But then, just doing the models, I was trying to explore the relationship
between the model and the original.
And I felt that I would have to actually go there and make some earthworks myself.
I opt for very simple line drawings -- kind of stupid looking.
being 150 meters away.
Now I would do very small ones, which would be like --
but under the same light, and I would show them together,
so the viewer would have to really figure it out what one he was looking.
I wasn't interested in the very large things, or in the small things.
I was more interested in the things in between,
you know, because you can leave an enormous range for ambiguity there.
This is like you see -- the size of a person over there.
This is a pipe.
A hanger.
-- everybody loves to watch somebody draw,
but not many people have a chance to watch somebody draw in --
a lot of people at the same time, to evidence a single drawing.
And I love this work,
because I did these cartoonish clouds over Manhattan for a period of two months.
And it was quite wonderful, because I had an interest -- an early interest -- in theater,
that's justified on this thing.
In theater, you have the character and the actor in the same place,
trying to negotiate each other in front of an audience.
And in this, you'd have like a --
something that looks like a cloud, and it is a cloud at the same time.
So they're like perfect actors.
Actually, I once paid like 60 dollars
to see a very great actor to do a version of "King Lear,"
and I felt really robbed, because by the time the actor started being King Lear,
he stopped being the great actor that I had paid money to see.
On the other hand, you know, I paid like three dollars, I think --
and I went to a warehouse in Queens
to see a version of "Othello" by an amateur group.
And it was quite fascinating, because you know the guy --
his name was Joey Grimaldi --
he impersonated the Moorish general
-- you know, for the first three minutes he was really that general,
and then he went back into plumber, he worked as a plumber, so --
plumber, general, plumber, general --
so for three dollars, I saw two tragedies for the price of one.
making people fall for a really perfect illusion,
as much as it is to make -- I usually work at the lowest threshold of visual illusion.
Because it's not about fooling somebody,
it's actually giving somebody a measure of their own belief:
how much you want to be fooled.
That's why we pay to go to magic shows and things like that.
Well, I think that's it.
My time is nearly up.
Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk about a technology that we're developing at Oxford now,
that we think is going to change the way that
computer games and Hollywood movies are being made.
That technology is simulating humans.
It's simulated humans with a simulated body
and a simulated nervous system to control that body.
Now, before I talk more about that technology,
let's have a quick look at what human characters look like
at the moment in computer games.
This is a clip from a game called "Grand Theft Auto 3."
We already saw that briefly yesterday.
And what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game.
It's one of the most successful games of all time.
But what you'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive.
They pretty much look the same.
I've made him run into a wall here, over and over again.
And you can see he looks always the same.
The reason for that is that these characters
are actually not real characters.
They are a graphical visualization of a character.
what's going to happen in the actual game,
and then has to animate that particular sequence.
So, he or she sits down, animates it, and tries to anticipate what's going to happen,
and then these particular animations are just played back
at appropriate times in the computer game.
Now, the result of that is that you can't have real interactivity.
All you have is animations that are played back
at more or less the appropriate times.
It also means that games aren't really going to be as surprising as they could be,
because you only get out of it, at least in terms of the character,
what you actually put into it.
There's no real emergence there.
Now, the only way to get around that
is to actually simulate the human body
and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body.
And maybe, if I could have you for a quick demonstration
to show what the difference is --
because, I mean, it's very, very trivial.
If I push Chris a bit, like this, for example, he'll react to it.
If I push him from a different angle, he'll react to it differently,
and that's because he has a physical body,
and because he has the motor skills to control that body.
It's a very trivial thing.
Thank you very much. Chris Anderson: That's it?
So, that's what we're trying to simulate --
not Chris specifically, I should say, but humans in general.
Now, we started working on this a while ago at Oxford University,
and we tried to start very simply.
What we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk.
That stick figure is physically stimulated. You can see it here on the screen.
So, it's subject to gravity, has joints, etc.
If you just run the simulation, it will just collapse, like this.
The tricky bit is now to put an AI controller in it
that actually makes it work.
And for that, we use the neural network, which we based on
that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine
that controls walking in humans.
It's called the central pattern generator.
So, we simulated that as well, and then the really tricky bit
is to teach that network how to walk.
For that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms.
and I suppose that most of you are familiar with that already.
But, just briefly, the concept is that
you create a large number of different individuals --
neural networks, in this case --
all of which are random at the beginning.
You hook these up -- in this case, to the virtual muscles
of that two-legged creature here --
and hope that it does something interesting.
At the beginning, they're all going to be very boring.
Most of them won't move at all,
but some of them might make a tiny step.
Those are then selected by the algorithm,
reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well.
And you repeat that process over and over again,
until you have something that walks --
in this case, in a straight line, like this.
So that was the idea behind this.
When we started this, I set up the simulation one evening.
It took about three to four hours to run the simulation.
I got up the next morning, went to the computer and looked at the results,
and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line,
like I've just demonstrated,
and this is what I got instead.
We did get it to work eventually,
after tweaking a bit here and there.
And this is an example of a successful evolutionary run.
So, what you'll see in a moment is a very simple biped
that's learning how to walk using artificial evolution.
At the beginning, it can't walk at all,
but it will get better and better over time.
So, this is the one that can't walk at all.
the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better.
still not quite there.
But now, after generation 20, it actually walks in a straight line without falling over.
That was the real breakthrough for us.
It was, academically, quite a challenging project,
and once we had reached that stage, we were quite confident
that we could try and do other things as well with this approach --
actually simulating the body
and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it.
Now, at this stage, it also became clear that this could be very exciting
for things like computer games or online worlds.
What you see here is the character standing there,
and there's an obstacle that we put in its way.
And what you see is, it's going to fall over the obstacle.
Now, the interesting bit is, if I move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right,
which is what I'm doing now, here,
it will fall over it in a completely different way.
And again, if you move the obstacle a tiny bit, it'll again fall differently.
are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles.
Okay. That's the video. Thanks.
Now, this might look kind of trivial, but it's actually very important
because this is not something you get at the moment
in any interactive or any virtual worlds.
Now, at this stage, we decided to start a company and move this further,
because obviously this was just a very simple, blocky biped.
What we really wanted was a full human body.
So we started the company.
We hired a team of physicists, software engineers and biologists
to work on this, and the first thing we had to work on
was to create the human body, basically.
It's got to be relatively fast, so you can run it on a normal machine,
but it's got to be accurate enough, so it looks good enough, basically.
and tried to make it as realistic as possible.
What you see here on the screen right now
is a very simple visualization of that body.
I should add that it's very simple to add things like hair, clothes, etc.,
but what we've done here is use a very simple visualization,
so you can concentrate on the movement.
Now, what I'm going to do right now, in a moment,
is just push this character a tiny bit and we'll see what happens.
Nothing really interesting, basically.
It falls over, but it falls over like a rag doll, basically.
The reason for that is that there's no intelligence in it.
It becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it.
So, this character now has motor skills in the upper body --
nothing in the legs yet, in this particular one.
But what it will do -- I'm going to push it again.
It will realize autonomously that it's being pushed.
It's going to stick out its hands.
It's going to turn around into the fall, and try and catch the fall.
So that's what you see here.
if you then add the AI for the lower part of the body as well.
So here, we've got the same character.
I'm going to push it a bit harder now,
harder than I just pushed Chris.
But what you'll see is -- it's going to receive a push now from the left.
What you see is it takes steps backwards,
it tries to counter-balance,
it tries to look at the place where it thinks it's going to land.
I'll show you this again.
And then, finally hits the floor.
Now, this becomes really exciting
when you push that character in different directions, again, just as I've done.
That's something that you cannot do right now.
At the moment, you only have empty computer graphics in games.
What this is now is a real simulation. That's what I want to show you now.
but now I'm just going to push it from different directions.
First, starting with a push from the right.
This is all slow motion, by the way, so we can see what's going on.
Now, the angle will have changed a tiny bit,
so you can see that the reaction is different.
Again, a push, now this time from the front.
And you see it falls differently.
And now from the left --
and it falls differently.
That was really exciting for us to see that.
That was the first time we've seen that.
This is the first time the public sees this as well,
because we have been in stealth mode.
I haven't shown this to anybody yet.
Now, just a fun thing:
what happens if you put that character --
this is now a wooden version of it, but it's got the same AI in it --
but if you put that character on a slippery surface, like ice.
We just did that for a laugh, just to see what happens.
We just took this character that I just talked about,
put it on a slippery surface, and this is what you get out of it.
And that's a really fascinating thing about this approach.
Now, when we went to film studios and games developers
and showed them that technology, we got a very good response.
And what they said was, the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen.
Because stunts are obviously very dangerous, they're very expensive,
and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you cannot do, obviously,
because you can't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt.
So, they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman
and that's what we've been working on for the past few months.
And that's our first product that we're going to release in a couple of weeks.
So, here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked.
That's what people want. That's what we're giving them.
This is not a dead body. This is a body who basically, in this particular case,
feels the force and tries to protect its head.
Only, I think it's quite a big blow again.
You feel kind of sorry for that thing,
and we've seen it so many times now that
we don't really care any more.
Now, here's another one.
What people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion,
a strong force applied to the character,
and have the character react to it in midair.
So that you don't have a character that looks limp,
but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away,
that looks kind of alive in midair as well.
So this character is going to be hit by a force,
it's going to realize it's in the air,
and it's going to try and, well,
stick out its arm in the direction where it's landing.
That's one angle; here's another angle.
We now think that the realism we're achieving with this
is good enough to be used in films.
This is something I just got last night
from an animation studio in London, who are using our software
and experimenting with it right now.
So this is exactly the same behavior that you saw,
but in a slightly better rendered version.
So if you look at the character carefully,
you see there are lots of body movements going on,
none of which you have to animate like in the old days.
Animators had to actually animate them.
This is all happening automatically in the simulation.
This is a slightly different angle,
and again a slow motion version of this.
This is incredibly quick. This is happening in real time.
You can run this simulation in real time, in front of your eyes,
change it, if you want to, and you get the animation straight out of it.
At the moment, doing something like this by hand
would take you probably a couple of days.
I'm not quite sure why, but we've done it anyway.
It's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach.
In this case, the character's hands
are fixed to a particular point in space,
and all we've told the character to do is to struggle.
And it looks organic. It looks realistic.
You feel kind of sorry for the guy.
It's even worse -- and that is another video I just got last night --
if you render that a bit more realistically.
how organic it actually can feel, how realistic it can look.
And this is all a physical simulation of the body,
using AI to drive virtual muscles in that body.
Now, one thing which we did for a laugh was
to create a slightly more complex stunt scene,
and one of the most famous stunts is the one where James Bond
jumps off a dam in Switzerland and then is caught by a bungee.
Got a very short clip here.
In this case, they were using a real stunt man. It was a very dangerous stunt.
It was just voted, I think in the Sunday Times, as one of the most impressive stunts.
Now, we've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves,
"Can we do that ourselves as well?"
Can we use the physical simulation of the character,
use artificial intelligence,
put that artificial intelligence into the character,
drive virtual muscles, simulate the way he jumps off the dam,
and then skydive afterwards,
and have him caught by a bungee afterwards?
We did that. It took about altogether just two hours,
pretty much, to create the simulation.
And that's what it looks like, here.
Now, this could do with a bit more work. It's still very early stages,
and we pretty much just did this for a laugh,
just to see what we'd get out of it.
But what we found over the past few months
is that this approach -- that we're pretty much standard upon --
is incredibly powerful.
We are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations.
There's very often very surprising behavior that you didn't predict before.
The first thing, as I said, is going to be virtual stuntmen.
Several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen,
and they're going to hit the screen quite soon, actually,
for some major productions.
The second thing is video games.
With this technology, video games will look different and they will feel very different.
For the first time, you'll have actors that really feel very interactive,
that have real bodies that really react.
I think that's going to be incredibly exciting.
Probably starting with sports games,
which are going to become much more interactive.
But I particularly am really excited
about using this technology in online worlds,
like there, for example, that Tom Melcher has shown us.
The degree of interactivity you're going to get
is totally different, I think, from what you're getting right now.
We've been approached by several simulation companies,
but one project we're particularly excited about, which we're starting next month,
is to use our technology -- and in particular, the walking technology --
to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy,
to predict the outcome of operations on these children.
As you probably know,
it's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is
if you try and correct the gait.
is what people think right now, is the outcome.
Now, what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool.
We're going to simulate the gait of a particular child
and the surgeon can then work on that simulation
and try out different ways to improve that gait,
before he actually commits to an actual surgery.
That's one project we're particularly excited about,
and that's going to start next month.
Just finally, this is only just the beginning.
We can only do several behaviors right now.
The AI isn't good enough to simulate a full human body.
The body yes, but not all the motor skills that we have.
And, I think, we're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing.
Right now, we don't have that
but I'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage.
the last thing I'm going to show you.
This was an AI contour that was produced and evolved --
half-evolved, I should say -- to produce balance, basically.
So, you kick the guy and the guy's supposed to counter-balance.
That's what we thought was going to come out of this.
But this is what emerged out of it, in the end.
So, this was not something we actually put in there.
He just started to create that dance himself.
He's actually a better dancer than I am, I have to say.
And what you see after a while --
I think he even goes into a climax right at the end.
And I think -- there you go.
That's just the simulation creating this itself, basically.
So it's just --
Not quite John Travolta yet, but we're working on that as well,
so thanks very much for your time.
Thanks.
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,
asking you to join me by stepping off the land
and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,
and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.
And it's a lively and a lovely place,
but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --
not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,
our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,
but also, most recently, with climate change,
and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,
more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating
will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.
and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,
but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi
is just not going to fill you up.
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.
So it may be good for the waistline,
but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish
isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,
that is, unless you eat jellyfish.
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack
on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,
whose primary prey are jellyfish.
for being the world's heaviest bony fish.
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here
that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --
that its favorite food is the moon jelly.
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,
even if one is eating the other.
Now this is typically how you see sunfish,
this is where they get their common name.
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.
They just lay out on the surface of the sea
and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,
they lie out and bask on the surface.
but it's actually Latin for millstone,
and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,
was this terribly bizarre shape.
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,
and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --
they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,
and then you look at the sunfish.
it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense
except in the light of evolution.
The Mola's no exception.
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,
65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,
and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --
oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,
about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction
that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --
we're going to head to the high seas.
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,
and we turn our puffer into the Mola.
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.
kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,
but in fact, in fact they are the --
they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,
right up there with flat fish.
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.
And in terms of fishes --
fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,
just 50 million years ago, so --
so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.
They start as little eggs,
and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again
for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,
can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --
and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.
And from that little egg,
they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,
and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.
That's a little diver up there in the corner.
for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage
till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.
600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,
and you had to feed this thing.
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --
we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,
but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --
one of the first places to have them in captivity --
they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.
I said, now, that's a true American.
because schooling used to be salvation for fishes,
but it's suicide for fishes now.
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,
they still get caught in nets as by-catch.
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,
then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --
how they live their lives, like the Mola.
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --
up to 26 percent of the drift net.
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,
they make up up to 90 percent.
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.
And how do you do that?
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.
This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?
Well, there's some great new technology
that has just recently become available,
and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,
which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.
And it can record this data for up to two years,
and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,
float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,
to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,
and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --
we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.
So the great thing about the Mola
is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --
that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.
But they have 40 genera of parasites,
and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.
They don't seem to mind, so far.
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,
using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.
We'd love to tag in Monterey.
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.
but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this
because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,
rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,
and then tosses them back and forth.
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just --
and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,
it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,
so we head down south, to San Diego.
Not so many California sea lions down there.
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,
and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there
because it's spa time for the Molas there.
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.
And they come and give the Molas --
you can see they strike this funny little position that says,
"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."
and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --
because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.
And it's also a great place to go down south
because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,
will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --
and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;
we've gone over to another part of the Pacific,
and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.
Well, not the one we tagged!
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,
to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.
after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,
I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out
during the course that the tag is recording.
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,
so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,
we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.
They're not big migrators. This is their track:
we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month
kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.
And that's kind of their home range.
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,
that population doesn't get replenished.
So that's a very important piece of data.
They're super industrious.
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --
they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up
and up and down, up to 40 times a day.
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,
and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,
and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --
which a whole variety of food's in that layer.
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,
they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance
between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.
we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,
a real three-dimensional play.
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,
where they're going to be tagging all over the world
and the Mola's going to enter into that.
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know
the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,
and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals
and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,
and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.
But people would write into the site with all sorts of,
all sorts of stories about these animals
and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --
a shared love and an interest in the oceans.
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns,
Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,
united by their love of life.
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:
"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book
that I was just in the process of completing,
that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today
about some of the controversies that that book inspired.
The book is called "The Blank Slate,"
based on the popular idea
that the human mind is a blank slate,
and that all of its structure comes from
socialization, culture, parenting, experience.
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.
Here are a few quotes indicating that:
"Man has no nature," from the historian
Jose Ortega y Gasset;
"Man has no instincts," from the
anthropologist Ashley Montagu;
"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors
and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.
is a blank slate,
and some of them just come from common sense.
As many people have told me over the years,
anyone who's had more than one child
knows that kids come into the world
with certain temperaments and talents;
it doesn't all come from the outside.
Oh, and anyone who
has both a child and a house pet
has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,
will acquire a human language,
whereas the house pet won't,
presumably because of some innate different between them.
And anyone who's ever been
in a heterosexual relationship knows that
the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.
There are also, I think,
increasing results from
the scientific study of humans
that, indeed, we're not born blank slates.
One of them, from anthropology,
is the study of human universals.
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --
kind of an occupational
pleasure of anthropologists to show
how exotic other cultures can be,
and that there are places out there where, supposedly,
everything is the opposite to the way it is here.
But if you instead
look at what is common to the world's cultures,
you find that there is an enormously rich set
of behaviors and emotions
and ways of construing the world
that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.
The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,
and they range from aesthetics,
affection and age statuses
all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,
attempts to control, the color white
and a worldview.
are increasingly showing that the brain
is intricately structured.
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson
and his colleagues in which they --
using MRI --
measured the distribution of gray matter --
that is, the outer layer of the cortex --
in a large sample of pairs of people.
They coded correlations in the thickness
of gray matter in different parts of the brain
using a false color scheme, in which
no difference is coded as purple,
and any color other than purple indicates
a statistically significant correlation.
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.
By definition, two people picked at random
can't have correlations in the distribution
of gray matter in the cortex.
This is what happens in people who share
half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain
are not purple, showing that if one person
has a thicker bit of cortex
in that region, so does his fraternal twin.
And here's what happens if you
get a pair of people who share all their DNA --
namely, clones or identical twins.
And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are
massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.
differences in anatomy,
like the shape of your ear lobes,
but they have consequences in thought and behavior
that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:
"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."
As you can see, there are two inventors
with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting
in the waiting room of a patent attorney.
Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because
studies of identical twins who were separated at birth
and then tested in adulthood
show that they have astonishing similarities.
And this happens in every pair of identical twins
separated at birth ever studied --
but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.
My favorite example is a pair of twins,
one of whom was brought up
as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,
the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota,
they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;
both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,
both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,
both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,
and both of them liked to surprise people
by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.
Now --
the story might seem to good to be true,
but when you administer
batteries of psychological tests,
you get the same results -- namely,
identical twins separated at birth show
quite astonishing similarities.
and scientific data
calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,
why should it have been such an appealing notion?
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.
The foremost is that if we're blank slates,
then, by definition, we are equal,
because zero equals zero equals zero.
But if something is written on the slate,
then some people could have more of it than others,
and according to this line of thinking, that would justify
discrimination and inequality.
is that if we are blank slates,
we can perfect mankind --
the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species
through social engineering.
Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts,
then perhaps some of them might condemn us
to selfishness, prejudice and violence.
Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.
And just to make a long story short:
first of all, the concept of fairness
is not the same as the concept of sameness.
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote
in the Declaration of Independence,
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are created equal,"
he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,
that all men are clones."
Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,
and that every person ought to be treated
as an individual, and not prejudged
by the statistics of particular groups
that they may belong to.
Also, even if we were born
with certain ignoble motives,
they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.
That is because the human mind
is a complex system with many parts,
and some of them can inhibit others.
For example, there's excellent reason to believe
that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,
and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us
to profit from the lessons of history.
So even if people did have impulses
towards selfishness or greed,
that's not the only thing in the skull,
and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.
go over controversies such as this one,
and a number of other hot buttons,
hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --
including the arts, cloning, crime,
free will, education, evolution,
gender differences, God, homosexuality,
infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,
Nazism, parenting, politics,
race, rape, religion, resource depletion,
social engineering, technological risk and war.
And needless to say, there were certain risks
in taking on these subjects.
When I wrote a first draft of the book,
I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,
and here are some of
the reactions that I got:
"Better get a security camera for your house."
"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers
or positions in scholarly societies."
"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown
in your author bio."
"Do you have tenure?"
(Laughter)
and nothing terrible has happened.
I -- I like --
There was indeed reason to be nervous,
and there were moments in which I did feel nervous,
knowing the history
of what has happened to people
who've taken controversial stands
or discovered disquieting findings
in the behavioral sciences.
There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,
of people who have been slandered, called Nazis,
physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution
for stumbling across or arguing
about controversial findings.
And you never know when you're going to
come across one of these booby traps.
My favorite example is a pair of psychologists
who did research on left-handers,
and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,
more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents
and have a shorter lifespan.
It's not clear, by the way, since then,
whether that is an accurate generalization,
but the data at the time seemed to support that.
Well, pretty soon they were barraged
with enraged letters,
death threats,
ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,
coming from irate left-handers
and their advocates,
and they were literally afraid to open their mail
because of the venom and vituperation
that they had inadvertently inspired.
the night is young, but the book has been out
for half a year,
and nothing terrible has happened.
None of the dire professional consequences
has taken place --
I haven't been
exiled from the city of Cambridge.
But what I wanted to talk about
are two of these hot buttons
that have aroused the strongest response
in the 80-odd reviews
that The Blank Slate has received.
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds,
and see if you can guess which two
-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics
inspired probably 90 percent
of the reaction in the various reviews
and radio interviews.
It's not violence and war,
it's not race, it's not gender,
it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.
They are: the arts and parenting.
(Laughter)
So let me tell you what
aroused such irate responses,
and I'll let you decide if whether they --
the claims are really that outrageous.
I note that among the long list of human universals
that I presented a few slides ago
are art.
There is no society ever discovered
in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something
that we would consider the arts.
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --
appears to be a human universal.
The telling of stories, music,
dance, poetry -- found in all cultures,
and many of the motifs and themes
that
give us pleasure in the arts
can be found in all human societies:
a preference for symmetrical forms,
the use of repetition and variation,
even things as specific as the fact
that in poetry all over the world,
you have lines that are very close
to three seconds long, separated by pauses.
Now, on the other hand,
in the second half of the 20th century,
the arts are frequently said to be in decline.
And I have a collection,
probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines
deploring the fact that
the arts are in decline in our time.
I'll give you a couple of representative quotes:
"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is
one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower
than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline
are visible in every department of human activity."
That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.
And a more recent one:
"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time
is becoming increasing problematical.
Serious book stores are losing their franchise,
nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily
by commercializing their repertory,
symphony orchestras are diluting their programs,
public television is increasing its dependence
on reruns of British sitcoms,
classical radio stations are dwindling,
museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."
That's from Robert Brustein,
the famous drama critic and director,
in The New Republic about five years ago.
I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,
but by any standard
they have never been flourishing
to a greater extent.
There are, of course, entirely new art forms
and new media, many of which you've heard
over these few days.
By any economic standard,
the demand for art of all forms
is skyrocketing,
as you can tell from the price of opera tickets,
by the number of books sold,
by the number of books published,
the number of musical titles released,
the number of new albums and so on.
The only grain of truth to this
complaint that the arts are in decline
come from three spheres.
One of them is in elite art since the 1930s --
say, the kinds of works performed
by major symphony orchestras,
where most of the repertory is before 1930,
or the works shown in
major galleries and prestigious museums.
In literary criticism and analysis,
probably 40 or 50 years ago,
literary critics were a kind of cultural hero;
now they're kind of a national joke.
And the humanities and arts programs
in the universities, which by many measures,
indeed are in decline.
Students are staying away in droves,
universities are disinvesting
in the arts and humanities.
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission,
they need all the help that they can get.
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence
that this supposed decline
in the elite arts and criticism
occurred in the same point in history in which
there was a widespread denial of human nature.
A famous quotation can be found --
if you look on the web, you can find it in
literally scores
of English core syllabuses --
"In or about December 1910,
human nature changed."
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,
and there's some debate
as to what she actually meant by that.
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,
that -- it's used now
as a way of saying that all forms
of appreciation of art
that were in place for centuries, or millennia,
in the 20th century were discarded.
The beauty and pleasure in art --
probably a human universal --
were -- began to be considered saccharine,
or kitsch, or commercial.
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art
is the desire to destroy beauty" --
which was considered bourgeois or tacky.
And here's just one example.
I mean, this is perhaps a representative example
of the visual depiction of the female form
in the 15th century;
here is a representative example
of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.
And, as you can see, there -- something has changed
in the way the elite arts
appeal to the senses.
and post-modernism,
there was visual art without beauty,
literature without narrative and plot,
poetry without meter and rhyme,
architecture and planning without ornament,
human scale, green space and natural light,
music without melody and rhythm,
and criticism without clarity,
attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.
(Laughter)
Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement.
But here, there -- one of the most famous literary
English scholars of our time
is the Berkeley professor,
Judith Butler.
And here is an example of
one of her analyses:
"The move from a structuralist account in which capital
is understood to structure social relations
in relatively homologous ways
to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,
convergence and rearticulation
brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,
and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory
that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."
Well, you get the idea.
By the way, this is one sentence --
you can actually parse it.
Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate"
was that elite art and criticism
in the 20th century,
although not the arts in general,
have disdained beauty, pleasure,
clarity, insight and style.
People are staying away from elite art and criticism.
What a puzzle -- I wonder why.
Well, this turned out to be probably
the most controversial claim in the book.
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in
in order to deflect ire
from discussions of gender and Nazism
and race and so on. I won't comment on that.
But it certainly inspired
an energetic reaction
from many university professors.
And the starting point is the -- for that discussion
was the fact that we have all
been subject to the advice
of the parenting industrial complex.
Now, here is -- here is a
representative quote from a besieged mother:
"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids
so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit
so they'll grow up to be healthy adults.
And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play
so they'll grow up smart.
And there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,
word games for reading success, large motor play,
small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life
to figuring out what to play with my kids."
I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize
with this mother.
Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based
are useless. They're useless because they don't control
for heritability. They measure some correlation
between what the parents do, how the children turn out
and assume a causal relation:
that the parenting shaped the child.
Parents who talk a lot to their kids
have kids who grow up to be articulate,
parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up
to be violent and so on.
And very few of them control for the possibility
that parents pass on genes for --
that increase the chances a child will be articulate
or violent and so on.
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children,
who provide an environment
but not genes to their kids,
we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.
have some sobering results.
Remember the Mallifert twins:
separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --
remarkably similar.
Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?
You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,
because not only would they share their genes,
but they would also share their environment.
That would make them super-similar, right?
Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,
who are separated at birth are no less similar
than if they had grown up together.
Everything that happens to you in a given home
over all of those years
appears to leave no permanent stamp
on your personality or intellect.
A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,
is that adopted siblings reared together --
the mirror image of identical twins reared apart,
they share their parents, their home,
their neighborhood,
don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.
not by their parents over the long run,
but in part -- only in part -- by their genes,
in part by their culture --
the culture of the country at large
and the children's own culture, namely their peer group --
as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,
that's what kids care about --
and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,
by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;
chance events as you live your life.
with just a remark
to bring it back to the theme of choices.
I think that the sciences of human nature --
behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology,
neuroscience, cognitive science --
are going to, increasingly in the years to come,
upset various dogmas,
careers and deeply-held political belief systems.
And that presents us with a choice.
The choice is whether certain facts about humans,
or topics, are to be considered taboos,
forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there
because no good can come from it,
or whether we should explore them honestly.
I have my own
answer to that question,
which comes from a great artist of the 19th century,
Anton Chekhov, who said,
"Man will become better when you show him
what he is like."
And I think that the argument
can't be put any more eloquently than that.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
The advances that have taken place in astronomy,
cosmology and biology, in the last 10 years,
are really extraordinary --
to the point where we know more about our universe and how it works
than many of you might imagine.
But there was something else that I've noticed
as those changes were taking place, as people were starting to find out that
hmm ... yeah, there really is a black hole at the center of every galaxy.
The science writers and editors -- I shouldn't say science writers,
I should say people who write about science --
and editors would sit down over a couple of beers,
after a hard day of work, and start talking about
some of these incredible perceptions about how the universe works.
which is ways the world could end very suddenly.
And that's what I want to talk about today. (Laughter)
Ah, you laugh, you fools. (Laughter)
Stephen Petranek: At first, it all seemed a little fantastical to me, but after challenging a lot of these ideas,
I began to take a lot of them seriously. And then September 11 happened,
and I thought, ah, God,
I can't go to the TED conference and talk about how the world is going to end.
Nobody wants to hear that. Not after this!
And that got me into a discussion with some other people, other scientists,
about maybe some other subjects, and one of the guys I talked to,
who was a neuroscientist, said,
"You know, I think there are a lot of solutions to the problems you brought up,"
and reminds me of Michael's talk yesterday
and his mother saying you can't have a solution if you don't have a problem.
So, we went out looking for solutions to ways that the world might end tomorrow,
and lo and behold, we found them.
Which leads me to a videotape of a President Bush
press conference from a couple of weeks ago.
Can we run that, Andrew?
and whatever it costs to defend our freedom, we must pay it.
He wants two trillion dollars to protect us from terrorists next year,
a two-trillion-dollar federal budget, which will land us back into deficit spending real fast.
But terrorists aren't the only threat we face.
There are really serious calamities staring us in the eye
that we're in the same kind of denial about
that we were about terrorism, and what could've happened on September 11.
from that 2.13 trillion dollar budget --
which is two one hundredths of that budget --
and we doled out a billion dollars to each one of these problems
I'm going to talk to you about, the vast majority could be solved,
and the rest we could deal with. So, I hope you find this both fascinating --
I'm fascinated by this kind of stuff, I gotta admit --
to me these are Richard's cockroaches.
I hope you take some of this stuff away with you,
and when you have an opportunity to be influential,
that you try to get some heavy-duty money spent on some of these ideas.
We live in an incredible age of modern medicine.
We are all much healthier than we were 20 years ago.
People around the world are getting better medicine --
but mentally, we're falling apart.
The World Health Organization now estimates
that one out of five people on the planet is clinically depressed.
And the World Health Organization also says that depression is the
biggest epidemic that humankind has ever faced.
are going to allow us to think of 100 as a normal lifespan.
A female child born tomorrow, on average -- median -- will live to age 83.
Our life longevity is going up almost a year for every year that passes.
Now the problem with all of this, getting older,
is that people over 65 are the most likely people to commit suicide.
We don't really have mental health insurance in this country,
and it's -- (Applause) -- it's really a crime.
Something like 98 percent of all people with depression,
and I mean really severe depression
-- I have a friend with stunningly severe depression
-- this is a curable disease, with present medicine and present technology.
But it is often a combination of talk therapy and pills.
Pills alone don't do it, especially in clinically depressed people.
You ought to be able to go to a psychiatrist or a psychologist,
and put down your 10-dollar copay, and get treated,
just like you do when you got a cut on your arm. It's ridiculous.
psychoactive drugs. We know that most mental illnesses have a biological
component that can be dealt with.
And we know just an amazing amount more about the brain now than we
did 10 years ago. We need a pump-push from the federal government,
through NIH and National Science -- NSF --
and places like that to start helping the drug companies
develop some advanced psychoactive drugs.
Ten years ago, you couldn't have found an astronomer --
well, very few astronomers -- in the world who would've told you that
there are any planets anywhere outside our solar system.
1995, we found three. The count now is up to 80 --
we're finding about two or three a month.
All of the ones we've found, by the way, are in this little, teeny, tiny corner where we live,
in the Milky Way. There must be millions of planets in the Milky Way,
and as Carl Sagan insisted for many years,
and was laughed at for it, there must be billions and billions in the universe.
In a few years, NASA is going to launch four or five telescopes out to Jupiter,
where there's less dust, and start looking for Earth-like planets,
which we cannot see with present technology, nor detect.
It's becoming obvious that the chance that life does not exist elsewhere in the universe,
and probably fairly close to us, is a fairly remote idea.
And the chance that some of it isn't more intelligent than ours is also a remote idea.
an industrial civilization, if you would -- for 200 years.
Although every time I go to Pompeii, I'm amazed that they had
the equivalent of a McDonald's on every street corner, too.
So, I don't know how much civilization really has progressed since AD 79,
but there's a great likelihood. I really believe this,
and I don't believe in aliens, and I don't believe there are any aliens on the Earth
or anything like that. But there's a likelihood that we will confront a
civilization that is more intelligent than our own.
suck up our oceans for the hydrogen?
And swat us away like flies, the way we swat away flies when we go into
the rainforest and start logging it.
We can look at our own history. The late physicist Gerard O'Neill said,
"Advanced Western civilization has had a destructive effect
on all primitive civilizations it has come in contact with,
even in those cases where every attempt was made
to protect and guard the primitive civilization."
If the aliens come visiting, we're the primitive civilization.
Thank God you can all read!
It may seem ridiculous, but we have a really lousy history of anticipating things like this
and actually being prepared for them.
How much energy and money does it take to actually have a plan
to negotiate with an advanced species?
we have to become an outward-looking, space-faring nation.
We have got to develop the
idea that the Earth doesn't last forever,
our sun doesn't last forever.
If we want humanity to last forever, we have to colonize the Milky Way.
And that is not something that is beyond comprehension at this point.
(Applause)
It'll also help us a lot, if we meet an advanced civilization along the way,
if we're trying to be an advanced civilization. Number eight --
Last July, in Science, the journal Science,
19 oceanographers published a very, very unusual article.
It wasn't really a research report; it was a screed.
They said, we've been looking at the oceans for a long time now,
and we want to tell you they're not in trouble, they're near collapse.
Many other ecosystems on Earth are in real, real danger.
We're living in a time of mass extinctions that exceeds the fossil record
by a factor of 10,000.
We have lost 25 percent of the unique species in Hawaii in the last 20 years.
California is expected to lose 25 percent of its species in the next 40 years.
Somewhere in the Amazon forest is the marginal tree.
You cut down that tree, the rain forest collapses as an ecosystem.
There's really a tree like that out there. That's really what it comes to.
And when that ecosystem collapses, it could take a major ecosystem with it,
like our atmosphere. So, what do we do about this? What are the solutions?
The problem with ecosystems is that we understand them so poorly,
that we don't know they're really in trouble until it's almost too late.
We need to know earlier that they're getting in trouble,
and we need to be able to pump possible solutions into models.
And with the kind of computing power we have now,
there is, as I say, some of this going on, but it needs money.
National Science Foundation needs to say -- you know,
almost all the money that's spent on science in this country
comes from the federal government, one way or another.
And they get to prioritize, you know?
There are people at the National Science Foundation
who get to say, this is the most important thing.
This is one of the things they ought to be thinking more about.
and start moving them around.
There's been an experiment for the last four or five years on the Georges Bank,
or the Grand Banks off of Newfoundland. It's a no-take fishing zone.
They can't fish there for a radius of 200 miles.
And an amazing thing has happened: almost all the fish have come back,
and they're reproducing like crazy. We're going to have to start doing this
around the globe. We're going to have to have no-take zones.
We're going to have to say, no more logging in the Amazon for 20 years.
Let it recover, before we start logging again.
(Applause)
You all remember Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber?
One of the things he raved about was that a particle accelerator experiment
could go haywire and set off a chain reaction that would destroy the world.
A lot of very sober-minded physicists, believe it or not,
have had exactly the same thought.
This spring -- there's a collider at Brookhaven, on Long Island --
this spring, it's going to have an experiment in which it creates black holes.
They are expecting to create little, tiny black holes.
They expect them to evaporate. (Laughter)
I hope they're right. (Laughter)
at CERN -- have the possibility of creating something called strangelets,
which are kind of like antimatter. Whenever they hit other matter, they destroy it
and obliterate it. Most physicists say that the accelerators we have now
are not really powerful enough to create black holes and strangelets
that we need to worry about, and they're probably right.
But, all around the world, in Japan, in Canada,
there's talk about this, of reviving this in the United States.
We shut one down that was going to be big.
But there's talk of building very big accelerators.
What can we do about this? What are the solutions?
We need to -- we need the advice of particle physicists to talk about particle physics
and what should be done in particle physics,
but we need some outside thinking and watchdogging
of what's going on with these experiments.
We have an electromagnetic field around the Earth,
and it's constantly bombarded by high-energy particles, like protons.
And in my opinion, we don't spend enough time
looking at that natural laboratory and figuring out first what's safe to do on Earth.
It's one of my favorite ones, because we've done several stories on Bt corn.
Bt corn is a corn that creates its own pesticide to kill a corn borer.
You may of heard of it -- heard it called StarLink,
especially when all those taco shells were taken out of the supermarkets
about a year and a half ago.
This stuff was supposed to only be feed for animals in the United States,
and it got into the human food supply, and somebody should've figured out
that it would get in the human food supply very easily.
But the thing that's alarming is a couple of months ago, in Mexico,
where Bt corn and all genetically altered corn is totally illegal,
they found Bt corn genes in wild corn plants.
Now, corn originated, we think, in Mexico.
This is the genetic biodiversity storehouse of corn.
This brings back a skepticism that has gone away recently,
that superweeds and superpests could spread around the world,
from biotechnology, that literally could destroy the world's food supply
in very short order.
We treat biotechnology with the same scrutiny we apply to nuclear power plants.
It's that simple. This is an amazingly unregulated field.
When the StarLink disaster happened, there was a battle between the
EPA and the FDA over who really had authority, and over what parts of this,
and they didn't get it straightened out for months. That's kind of crazy.
Believe it or not, this happens every few hundred thousand years,
and has happened many times in our history.
North Pole goes to the South, South Pole goes to the North, and vice versa.
But what happens, as this occurs,
is that we lose our magnetic field around the Earth over the period of about 100 years,
and that means that all these cosmic rays and particles
that are to come streaming at us from the sun,
that this field protects us from, are -- well, basically, we're gonna fry. (Laughter)
It's been 780,000 years since this happened.
So, it should have happened about 480,000 years ago.
Oh, and here's one other thing.
Scientists think now our magnetic field may be diminished by about five percent.
So, maybe we're in the throes of it.
One of the problems of trying to figure out how healthy the Earth is,
is that we have -- you know, we don't have good weather data from 60 years ago,
much less data on things like the ozone layer.
There's going to be a lot of cheap rocketry that's going to come online
in about six or seven years
that gets us into the low atmosphere very cheaply.
You know, we can make ozone from car tailpipes.
It's not hard: it's just three oxygen atoms.
If you brought the entire ozone layer down to the surface of the Earth,
it would be the thickness of two pennies, at 14 pounds per square inch.
You don't need that much up there.
We need to learn how to repair and replenish the Earth's ozone layer.
(Applause)
Solar flares are enormous magnetic outbursts from the Sun
that bombard the Earth with high-speed subatomic particles.
So far, our atmosphere has done, and our magnetic field has done
pretty well protecting us from this.
Occasionally, we get a flare from the Sun that causes havoc
with communications and so forth, and electricity.
But the alarming thing is that astronomers recently have been studying
stars that are similar to our Sun,
and they've found that a number of them, when they're about the age of our Sun,
brighten by a factor of as much as 20. Doesn't last for very long.
And they think these are super-flares, millions of times more powerful
than any flares we've had from our Sun so far.
There's a flip side to it. In studying stars
like our Sun, we've found that they go through periods of diminishment,
when their total amount of energy that's expelled from them
goes down by maybe one percent.
One percent doesn't sound like a lot, but it would cause one hell of an ice age here.
So, what can we do about this?
I wrote a story about this in Life magazine in 1993.
This is rocket science, but it's not hard rocket science.
Everything that we need to make an atmosphere on Mars,
and to make a livable planet on Mars, is probably there.
And you just, literally, have to send little nuclear factories up there
that gobble up the iron oxide on the surface of Mars and spit out the oxygen.
The problem is it takes 300 years to terraform Mars, minimum.
Really more like 500 years to do it right.
There's no reason why we shouldn't start now. (Laughter)
A new global epidemic. People have been at war with germs
ever since there have been people,
and from time to time, the germs sure get the upper hand.
In 1918, we had a flu epidemic in the United States that killed 20 million people.
That was back when the population was around 100 million people.
The bubonic plague in Europe, in the Middle Ages,
killed one out of four Europeans.
AIDS is coming back. Ebola seems to be rearing its head
with much too much frequency,
and old diseases like cholera are becoming resistant to antibiotics.
We've all learned what -- the kind of panic that can occur
when an old disease rears its head, like anthrax.
for which we have one antibiotic that still works, mutates.
And we know staph can do amazing things.
A staph cell can be next to a muscle cell in your body and borrow genes from it
when antibiotics come, and change and mutate.
The danger is that some germ like staph will be --
will mutate into something that's really virulent, very contagious,
and will sweep through populations before we can do anything about it.
That's happened before. About 12,000 years ago,
there was a massive wave of mammal extinctions in the Americas,
and that is thought to have been a virulent disease.
So, what can we do about it?
every cow, every lamb, every chicken, they get antibiotics every day, all.
You know, you go to a restaurant, you eat fish, I got news for you,
it's all farmed. You know, you gotta ask when you go to a restaurant if it's a wild fish,
cause they're not going to tell you. We're giving away the code.
This is like being at war and giving somebody your secret code.
We're telling the germs out there how to fight us.
We gotta fix that. We gotta outlaw that right away.
We have a real, major outbreak of disease in the United States,
we are not prepared to cope with it.
Now, there is money in the federal budget, next year,
to build up the public health service.
But I don't think to any extent that it really needs to be done.
You know, 10 years ago, or 15 years ago, really,
you walk into an astronomy convention, and you say,
"You know, there's probably a black hole at the center of every galaxy,"
and they're going to hoot you off the stage.
And now, if you went into one of those conventions and you said,
"Well, I don't think black holes are out there," they'd hoot you off the stage.
Our comprehension of the way the universe works is really --
has just gained unbelievably in recent years.
And these stars have compressed down to maybe something like 12, 15 miles wide,
and they are black holes. And they are gobbling up everything around them,
including light, which is why we can't see them.
Most of them should be in orbit around something.
But galaxies are very violent places, and things can be spun out of orbit.
And also, space is incredibly vast.
So even if you flung a million of these things out of orbit,
the chances that one would actually hit us is fairly remote.
But it only has to get close, about a billion miles away, one of these things.
About a billion miles away, here's what happens to Earth's orbit:
it becomes elliptical instead of circular.
And for three months out of the year,
the surface temperatures go up to 150 to 180.
For three months out of the year, they go to 50 below zero.
That won't work too well. What can we do about this?
And this is my scariest. (Laughter)
I don't have a good answer for this one.
Again, we gotta think about being a colonizing race.
a really big asteroid heads for Earth.
The important thing to remember here -- this is not a question of if,
this is a question of when, and how big.
In 1908, just a 200-foot piece of a comet
exploded over Siberia and flattened forests for maybe 100 miles.
It had the effect of about 1,000 Hiroshima bombs.
Astronomers estimate that little asteroids like that come about every hundred years.
In 1989, a large asteroid passed 400,000 miles away from Earth.
It passed directly through Earth's orbit. We were in that that spot six hours earlier.
A small asteroid, say a half mile wide, would touch off firestorms
followed by severe global cooling from the debris kicked up --
Carl Sagan's nuclear winter thing.
An asteroid five miles wide causes major extinctions.
We think the one that got the dinosaurs was about five miles wide.
Where are they? There's something called the Kuiper belt,
which -- some people think Pluto's not a planet,
that's where Pluto is, it's in the Kuiper belt.
There's also something a little farther out, called the Oort cloud.
There are about 100,000 balls of ice and rock -- comets, really --
out there, that are 50 miles in diameter or more,
and they regularly take a little spin,
in towards the Sun and pass reasonably close to us.
Of more concern, I think, is the asteroids that exist between Mars and Jupiter.
The folks at the Sloan Digital Sky Survey told us last fall --
they're making the first map of the universe, three-dimensional map of the universe --
that there are probably 700,000 asteroids between Mars and Jupiter
that are a half a mile big or bigger.
So you say, yeah, well, what are really the chances of this happening?
Andrew, can you put that chart up?
presented to Congress a few years ago.
You'll notice that the chance of an asteroid-slash-comet impact killing you
is about one in 20,000, according to the work they've done.
Now look at the one right below that.
Passenger aircraft crash, one in 20,000.
We spend an awful lot of money trying to be sure that we don't die in airplane accidents,
and we're not spending hardly anything on this. And yet, this is completely preventable.
We finally have, just in the last year, the technology to stop this cold.
Could we have the solutions?
that is like pocket change -- to search for asteroids.
Because we can actually figure out every asteroid that's out there,
and if it might hit Earth, and when it might hit Earth.
And they're trying to do that.
But it's going to take them 10 years, at spending three million dollars a year,
and even then, they claim they'll only have about 80 percent of them catalogued.
Comets are a tougher act.
We don't really have the technology to predict comet trajectories,
or when one with our name on it might arrive.
But we would have lots of time, if we see it coming.
We really need a dedicated observatory.
You'll notice that a lot of comets are named after people you never heard of,
amateur astronomers? That's because nobody's looking for them, except amateurs.
We need a dedicated observatory that looks for comets.
or alter its trajectory. Now, a year ago, we did an amazing thing.
We sent a probe out to this asteroid belt,
called NEAR, Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous.
And these guys orbited a 30 -- or no, about a 22-mile long asteroid called Eros.
And then, of course, you know, they pulled one of those sneaky NASA things,
where they had extra batteries and extra gas aboard and everything,
and then, at the last minute, they landed.
When the mission was over, they actually landed on the thing.
We have landed a rocket ship on an asteroid. It's not a big deal.
Now, the trouble with just sending a bomb out for this thing
is that you don't have anything to push against in space, because there's no air.
A nuclear explosion is just as hot,
but we don't really have anything big enough to melt a 22-mile long asteroid,
or vaporize it, would be more like it.
and put something like a small ion propulsion motor on it,
which would gently, slowly, after a period of time, push it into a different trajectory,
which, if we've done our math right, would keep it from hitting Earth.
This is just a matter of finding 'em, going there, and doing something about it.
I know your head is spinning from all this stuff.
Yikes! So many big threats!
We don't want to get caught flat-footed again.
We know about this stuff.
Science has the power to predict the future in many cases now.
Knowledge is power.
The worst thing we can do is say, jeez, I got enough to worry about
without worrying about an asteroid. (Laughter)
That's a mistake that could literally cost us our future.
Thank you.
about how a company called Silk tripled their sales;
how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody
to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact;
to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect.
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years --
a record label I started that had a CD called "Sauce."
Now, before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s
I wonder what they said?
Like the greatest invention since the telegraph or something.
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread,
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this --
that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available
And I think that the way you're going to get what you want,
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion.
When I talk about it I usually pick business,
because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation,
and because it's the easiest sort of way to keep score.
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way.
I call it the "TV-industrial complex."
The way the TV-industrial complex works, is you buy some ads,
interrupt some people, that gets you distribution.
You take the profit from that to buy more ads.
And it goes around and around and around,
the same way that the military-industrial complex worked a long time ago.
That model of, and we heard it yesterday --
and tell them about what we want to do.
Well, this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours.
I mean, all of these products succeeded because someone figured out
how to touch people in a way they weren't expecting,
is that it's not working the way that it used to.
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars
trying to interrupt me in one year.

Now there are magazines about water.

I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something,
Part of the reason is -- they've got way more choices than they used to,
and way less time.
And my parable here is you're driving down the road
Cows are invisible. Cows are boring.
I could do that again if you want.
I mean, if all cows were purple you'd get bored with those, too.
The thing that's going to decide what gets talked about,
what gets done, what gets changed,
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going.

is that they don't have anything in common.
It's never "The Godfather," it's never "Citizen Kane,"

and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend.
And when Lionel started his bakery, the French pooh-pooh-ed it.
It wasn't what they expected.
That's what mass marketing is.
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken,
I don't think that's a strategy we want to use any more.
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people
because they're really good at ignoring you.
And when you talk to them, they'll listen,
because they like listening -- it's about them.
It describes the desire of someone who's obsessed to say,

because it'll blow out the windshield otherwise.

because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about, because it's remarkable.
They didn't just slap a new ad on the product;

They got this way by being remarkable,

That's a purple cow; that's something worth noticing.
What I want to tell you about today is how I see robots invading our lives
at multiple levels, over multiple timescales.
Assuming -- despite all the dire predictions from many people about our future --
assuming we're still around, I can't imagine the world not being populated with robots.
And then the question is, well, if they're going to be here in 500 years,
are they going to be everywhere sooner than that?
Are they going to be around in 50 years?
Yeah, I think that's pretty likely -- there's going to be lots of robots everywhere.
And in fact I think that's going to be a lot sooner than that.
I think we're sort of on the cusp of robots becoming common,
and I think we're sort of around 1978 or 1980 in personal computer years,
where the first few robots are starting to appear.
And you know, the first computer most people had in the house
may have been a computer to play Pong,
a little microprocessor embedded,
and then other games that came after that.
And we're starting to see that same sort of thing with robots:
LEGO Mindstorms, Furbies -- who here -- did anyone here have a Furby?
Yeah, there's 38 million of them sold worldwide.
They are pretty common. And they're a little tiny robot,
a simple robot with some sensors,
a little bit of processing actuation.
And just as in the early days,
And on the left there is a platform from Evolution Robotics,
where you put a PC on, and you program this thing with a GUI
to wander around your house and do various stuff.
And then there's a higher price point sort of robot toys --
the Sony Aibo. And on the right there, is one that the NEC developed,
the PaPeRo, which I don't think they're going to release.
But nevertheless, those sorts of things are out there.
Husqvarna on the bottom, Friendly Robotics on top there, an Israeli company.
And then in the last 12 months or so
we've started to see a bunch of home-cleaning robots appear.
The top left one is a very nice home-cleaning robot
from a company called Dyson, in the U.K. Except it was so expensive --
3,500 dollars -- they didn't release it.
Another one from Karcher.
At the bottom right is one that I built in my lab
about 10 years ago, and we finally turned that into a product.
And let me just show you that.
We're going to give this away I think, Chris said, after the talk.
This is a robot that you can go out and buy, and that will clean up your floor.
And it starts off sort of just going around in ever-increasing circles.
If it hits something -- you people see that?
Now it's doing wall-following, it's following around my feet
to clean up around me. Let's see, let's --
oh, who stole my Rice Krispies? They stole my Rice Krispies!
(Laughter)
Don't worry, relax, no, relax, it's a robot, it's smart!
(Laughter)
See, the three-year-old kids, they don't worry about it.
It's grown-ups that get really upset.
(Laughter)
We'll just put some crap here.
(Laughter)
Okay.
(Laughter)
I don't know if you see -- so, I put a bunch of Rice Krispies there,
I put some pennies, let's just shoot it at that, see if it cleans up.
Yeah, OK. So --
we'll leave that for later.
(Applause)
the intelligence on board was fairly simple.
And that's true with a lot of robots.
We've all, I think, become, sort of computational chauvinists,
and think that computation is everything,
but the mechanics still matter.
Here's another robot, the PackBot,
that we've been building for a bunch of years.
It's a military surveillance robot, to go in ahead of troops --
looking at caves, for instance.
much more robust than the robots we build in our labs.
(Laughter)
On board that robot is a PC running Linux.
It can withstand a 400G shock. The robot has local intelligence:
it can flip itself over, can get itself into communication range,
can go upstairs by itself, et cetera.
Okay, so it's doing local navigation there.
A soldier gives it a command to go upstairs, and it does.
That was not a controlled descent.
(Laughter)
Now it's going to head off.
And the big breakthrough for these robots, really, was September 11th.
We had the robots down at the World Trade Center late that evening.
Couldn't do a lot in the main rubble pile,
things were just too -- there was nothing left to do.
But we did go into all the surrounding buildings that had been evacuated,
and searched for possible survivors in the buildings
that were too dangerous to go into.
Let's run this video.
Reporter: ...battlefield companions are helping to reduce the combat risks.
Nick Robertson has that story.
Rodney Brooks: Can we have another one of these?
Okay, good.
So, this is a corporal who had seen a robot two weeks previously.
He's sending robots into caves, looking at what's going on.
The robot's being totally autonomous.
The worst thing that's happened in the cave so far
was one of the robots fell down ten meters.
Now they're on active duty in Afghanistan every day.
And that's one of the reasons they say a robot invasion is happening.
There's a sea change happening in how -- where technology's going.
Thanks.
And over the next couple of months,
we're going to be sending robots in production
down producing oil wells to get that last few years of oil out of the ground.
Very hostile environments, 150˚ C, 10,000 PSI.
Autonomous robots going down, doing this sort of work.
But robots like this, they're a little hard to program.
How, in the future, are we going to program our robots
and make them easier to use?
And I want to actually use a robot here --
a robot named Chris -- stand up. Yeah. Okay.
Come over here. Now notice, he thinks robots have to be a bit stiff.
He sort of does that. But I'm going to --
Chris Anderson: I'm just British. RB: Oh.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'm going to show this robot a task. It's a very complex task.
Now notice, he nodded there, he was giving me some indication
he was understanding the flow of communication.
And if I'd said something completely bizarre
he would have looked askance at me, and regulated the conversation.
So now I brought this up in front of him.
I'd looked at his eyes, and I saw his eyes looked at this bottle top.
And I'm doing this task here, and he's checking up.
His eyes are going back and forth up to me, to see what I'm looking at --
so we've got shared attention.
And so I do this task, and he looks, and he looks to me
to see what's happening next. And now I'll give him the bottle,
and we'll see if he can do the task. Can you do that?
(Laughter)
Okay. He's pretty good. Yeah. Good, good, good.
I didn't show you how to do that.
Now see if you can put it back together.
(Laughter)
And he thinks a robot has to be really slow.
Good robot, that's good.
We saw when we're interacting,
we're trying to show someone how to do something, we direct their visual attention.
The other thing communicates their internal state to us,
whether he's understanding or not, regulates a social interaction.
There was shared attention looking at the same sort of thing,
and recognizing socially communicated reinforcement at the end.
And we've been trying to put that into our lab robots
because we think this is how you're going to want to interact with robots in the future.
I just want to show you one technical diagram here.
The most important thing for building a robot that you can interact with socially
is its visual attention system.
Because what it pays attention to is what it's seeing
and interacting with, and what you're understanding what it's doing.
So in the videos I'm about to show you,
you're going to see a visual attention system on a robot
which has -- it looks for skin tone in HSV space,
so it works across all human colorings.
It looks for highly saturated colors, from toys.
And it looks for things that move around.
And it weights those together into an attention window,
and it looks for the highest-scoring place --
the stuff where the most interesting stuff is happening --
and that is what its eyes then segue to.
And it looks right at that.
At the same time, some top-down sort of stuff:
might decide that it's lonely and look for skin tone,
or might decide that it's bored and look for a toy to play with.
And so these weights change.
this is what we call the Steven Spielberg memorial module.
Did people see the movie "AI"? (Audience: Yes.)
looked at the blue fairy for 2,000 years without taking his eyes off it?
Well, this gets rid of that,
because this is a habituation Gaussian that gets negative,
and more and more intense as it looks at one thing.
And it gets bored, so it will then look away at something else.
So, once you've got that -- and here's a robot, here's Kismet,
looking around for a toy. You can tell what it's looking at.
You can estimate its gaze direction from those eyeballs covering its camera,
and you can tell when it's actually seeing the toy.
And it's got a little bit of an emotional response here.
(Laughter)
But it's still going to pay attention
if something more significant comes into its field of view --
such as Cynthia Breazeal, the builder of this robot, from the right.
It sees her, pays attention to her.
Kismet has an underlying, three-dimensional emotional space,
a vector space, of where it is emotionally.
And at different places in that space, it expresses --
can we have the volume on here?
Can you hear that now, out there? (Audience: Yeah.)
Do you really think so?
and the prosody in its voice.
And when I was dealing with my robot over here,
Chris, the robot, was measuring the prosody in my voice,
and so we have the robot measure prosody for four basic messages
that mothers give their children pre-linguistically.
Here we've got naive subjects praising the robot:
You're such a cute little robot.
(Laughter)
RB: And the robot's reacting appropriately.
(Laughter)
These are naive subjects.
Here we asked them to get the robot's attention
and indicate when they have the robot's attention.
Voice: Kismet, do you like the toy? Oh.
and this first woman really pushes the robot into an emotional corner.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
When we talk to someone, we talk.
Then we sort of raise our eyebrows, move our eyes,
give the other person the idea it's their turn to talk.
And then they talk, and then we pass the baton back and forth between each other.
So we put this in the robot.
We got a bunch of naive subjects in,
we didn't tell them anything about the robot,
sat them down in front of the robot and said, talk to the robot.
Now what they didn't know was,
the robot wasn't understanding a word they said,
and that the robot wasn't speaking English.
It was just saying random English phonemes.
And I want you to watch carefully, at the beginning of this,
where this person, Ritchie, who happened to talk to the robot for 25 minutes --
(Laughter)
-- says, "I want to show you something.
I want to show you my watch."
And he brings the watch center, into the robot's field of vision,
points to it, gives it a motion cue,
and the robot looks at the watch quite successfully.
We don't know whether he understood or not that the robot --
Notice the turn-taking.
Ritchie: OK, I want to show you something. OK, this is a watch
that my girlfriend gave me.
Robot: Oh, cool.
Ritchie: Yeah, look, it's got a little blue light in it too. I almost lost it this week.
(Laughter)
RB: So it's making eye contact with him, following his eyes.
Ritchie: Can you do the same thing? Robot: Yeah, sure.
RB: And they successfully have that sort of communication.
This is another robot, Cog.
They first make eye contact, and then, when Christie looks over at this toy,
the robot estimates her gaze direction
and looks at the same thing that she's looking at.
(Laughter)
So we're going to see more and more of this sort of robot
over the next few years in labs.
But then the big questions, two big questions that people ask me are:
if we make these robots more and more human-like,
will we accept them, will we -- will they need rights eventually?
And the other question people ask me is, will they want to take over?
(Laughter)
And on the first -- you know, this has been a very Hollywood theme
with lots of movies. You probably recognize these characters here --
where in each of these cases, the robots want more respect.
Well, do you ever need to give robots respect?
They're just machines, after all.
But I think, you know, we have to accept that we are just machines.
After all, that's certainly what modern molecular biology says about us.
You don't see a description of how, you know,
Molecule A, you know, comes up and docks with this other molecule.
And it's moving forward, you know, propelled by various charges,
and then the soul steps in and tweaks those molecules so that they connect.
It's all mechanistic. We are mechanism.
If we are machines, then in principle at least,
we should be able to build machines out of other stuff,
which are just as alive as we are.
But I think for us to admit that,
we have to give up on our special-ness, in a certain way.
And we've had the retreat from special-ness
under the barrage of science and technology many times
over the last few hundred years, at least.
500 years ago we had to give up the idea
that we are the center of the universe
when the earth started to go around the sun;
150 years ago, with Darwin, we had to give up the idea we were different from animals.
And to imagine -- you know, it's always hard for us.
Recently we've been battered with the idea that maybe
we didn't even have our own creation event, here on earth,
which people didn't like much. And then the human genome said,
maybe we only have 35,000 genes. And that was really --
people didn't like that, we've got more genes than that.
We don't like to give up our special-ness, so, you know,
having the idea that robots could really have emotions,
or that robots could be living creatures --
I think is going to be hard for us to accept.
But we're going to come to accept it over the next 50 years or so.
And here the standard scenario is that we create these things,
they grow, we nurture them, they learn a lot from us,
and then they start to decide that we're pretty boring, slow.
They want to take over from us.
And for those of you that have teenagers, you know what that's like.
(Laughter)
But Hollywood extends it to the robots.
And the question is, you know,
will someone accidentally build a robot that takes over from us?
And that's sort of like this lone guy in the backyard,
you know -- "I accidentally built a 747."
I don't think that's going to happen.
And I don't think --
(Laughter)
-- I don't think we're going to deliberately build robots
that we're uncomfortable with.
We'll -- you know, they're not going to have a super bad robot.
Before that has to come to be a mildly bad robot,
and before that a not so bad robot.
(Laughter)
And we're just not going to let it go that way.
(Laughter)
So, I think I'm going to leave it at that: the robots are coming,
we don't have too much to worry about, it's going to be a lot of fun,
and I hope you all enjoy the journey over the next 50 years.
(Applause)
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.
(Laughter)
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.
And you're on the outside, you're at home.
You're like the Raspyni Brothers,
where you've got your balls in cold water. And --
(Laughter) --
you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time
and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.
And you want to go back and do it again.
But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,
and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.
within the subject of creation and optimism.
And if you put creation and optimism together,
you've got two choices that you can talk about.
You can talk about creationism --
which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,
at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --
or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.
But any kind of conversation about architecture --
which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,
setting up TED, small-scale architecture --
at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,
the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.
which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,
what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation
that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?
And our own opportunity to make something new there?
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,
brought architecture into focus
in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,
and made it a subject for common conversation.
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,
a time when five people sat me down at a table
and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,
safety concerns and whether carpet burns.
These are just not things we talked about very often.
And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,
you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.
And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,
we're going to think about it like this.
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.
They've made a selection.
They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,
the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.
Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,
and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,
and now to an even larger instrument,
upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,
as you see here.
He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,
after six previous firms struck out
with things that were so stupid and banal
that even the city of New York was forced to go,
"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."
Right. Can we do this again from the top,
except use some people with a vague hint of talent,
instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,
real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.
And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.
This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,
and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.
This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:
a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.
Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,
because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction
by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.
But that's what we're going to do.
But I want you to think about these things
in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,
and that these two things talk about very specifically.
And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,
in trying to decide whether we want architecture
from the kind of technocratic solution to everything --
that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,
be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --
or something that's more of a romantic solution.
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.
So, in the American tradition,
the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,
would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's
Cartesian grids spreading across the United States,
that gives us basically the whole shape
of every western state in the United States,
as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --
in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.
Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?
Manifest destiny.
it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?
Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one
the moment they saw one.
And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,
rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,
and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.
Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.
back and forth between this technocratic solution
and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.
So we're going to go straight into this.
Can I have the lights off for a moment?
I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly
that represent the current split, architecturally,
between these two traditions of a technocratic
or technological solution and a romantic solution.
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.
One very young, one a little more mature.
This is the work of a firm called SHoP,
and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings
of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses
that takes a picture of the outside world --
it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --
and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.
does it look like a regular building? No.
It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,
square, rectangular, anything like that,
that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.
The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,
has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,
traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.
What's interesting about it is not the shape.
What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.
A brand-new way to put buildings together,
something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.
What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,
is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.
That's why we all live in developer houses.
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.
That's because it's cheaper.
a program that says, manufacture these parts.
The computer then talks to a machine --
a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --
that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,
because the computer is just a machine.
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,
so the parts can all be cut at the same time.
Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,
which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,
what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,
like you used to get when you were a child,
when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."
And so what the builder will get is every single individual part
that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck
to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.
Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --
and that's what will happen in the end.
Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,
these same architects were asked to produce something
for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,
as part of their young architects summer series.
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?
In the summer, you go to the beach.
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,
and that computer program shaped a sand dune
and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --
at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --
a set of instructions for pieces of wood.
And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.
These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.
and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,
and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.
And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,
and there it is fully built.
There are only 16 different pieces of wood,
only 16 different assembly parts here.
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,
where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.
this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,
replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,
that very important pedestrian connection
between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.
They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,
building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.
And they were able to do it. That was their design,
using that same computer modeling system
and only five or six really different kinds of parts,
a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material
and a very simple framing system
that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.
They were able to create that.
They were able to create something wonderful.
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,
using the same technology.
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,
so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.
Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,
and you get the same kind of grandeur.
Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,
whose work you can see out here today.
The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work
in a very different fashion.
It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you
into something that you can do, into something that will please you,
something that will lift your spirits,
something that will make you feel as if are in another world --
such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,
which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City
to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.
Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.
It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.
Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.
This is happening by itself.
It transforms through the magic of lighting.
It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.
Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,
up on the Upper West Side,
with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.
Let's see it one more time.
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.
And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good
in places that you wouldn't have felt good before.
It's about bringing nature to the inside.
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world
to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space
of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.
It's about stimulation.
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,
all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters
for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,
where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.
And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.
I am known best for human-powered flight,
but that was just one thing that got me going
in the sort of things that I'm working in now.
As a youngster, I was very interested in model airplanes,
ornithopters, autogyros, helicopters, gliders, power planes,
indoor models, outdoor models, everything,
which I just thought was a lot of fun,
and wondered why most other people didn't share my same enthusiasm with them.
And then, navy pilot training, and, after college,
I got into sailplane flying, power plane flying,
and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun,
but got tangled up with some great professor types,
who convinced me and everybody else in the field
that this was a good way to get into really deep science.
although getting a Ph.D. in aeronautics.
The weather modification subject was getting started,
and as a graduate student,
I could go around to the various talks that were being given,
on a hitchhiker ride to the East Coast,
and so on. And everybody would talk to me,
but all the professionals in the field hated each other,
and they wouldn't communicate. And as a result,
I got the absolutely unique background in that field,
and started a company, which did more research
in weather modification than anybody,
and there are a lot of things that I just can't go into.
But then, 1971 started AeroVironment, with no employees --
then one or two, three,
and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects.
We had AirDynamisis,
who, like I, did not want to work for aerospace companies
on some big, many year project,
and so we did our small projects, and the company slowly grew.
I suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane
because I'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars,
or I guaranteed the money at the bank.
He needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company.
The company did not succeed, and he couldn't pay the money back,
and I was the guarantor of the note. So, I had a $100,000 debt,
and I noticed that the Kramer prize for human-powered flight,
which had then been around for -- (Laughter) --
17 years at the time, was 50,000 pounds,
which, at the exchange rate, was just about 100,000 dollars.
(Laughter) --
and did not -- the way I approached it, first,
thinking about ways to make the planes,
was just like they'd been doing in England, and not succeeding,
and I gave it up. I figured, nah, there isn't any simple, easy way.
But then, got off on a vacation trip, and was studying bird flight,
just for the fun of it,
and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles,
and measure the time, and estimate the bank angle,
and immediately, figure out its speed,
and the turning radius, and so on,
which I could do in the car, as we're driving along on a vacation trip --
(Laughter) --
with my three sons, young sons, helping me,
but ridiculing the whole thing very much.
and then how airplanes would, how hang gliders would fly,
and then other planes,
and the idea of the Gossamer-Condor-type airplane quickly emerged,
was so logical, one should have thought of it in the first place,
but one didn't. And it was just, keep the weight down --
70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up, like a hang glider,
but three times the span, three times the cord.
You're down to a third of the speed, a third of the power,
and a good bicyclist can put out that power, and that worked,
and we won the prize a year later.
and ones that did work, and the plane kept getting a little better, a little better.
Got a good pilot, Brian Allen, to operate it,
and finally, succeeded. But unfortunately,
about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project.
But fortunately, Henry Kramer, who put up the prize for --
that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize
for flying the English Channel, 21 miles.
And he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that.
We realized that if you just cleaned up our Gossamer Condor a little bit,
the power to fly would be decreased a little bit,
and if you decrease the power required a little,
the pilot can fly a much longer period of time.
And Brian Allen was able, in a miraculous flight,
to get the Gossamer Albatross across the English Channel,
and we won the 100,000-pound, 200,000-dollar prize for that.
And when all expenses were paid, the debt was handled, and everything was fine.
It turned out that giving the planes to the museum
was worth much more than the debt,
so for five years, six years, I only had to pay one third income tax.
So, there were good economic reasons for the project, but --
(Laughter) --
and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then --
(Laughter) --
because the prizes are all over.
(Laughter)
But that sure started me thinking about various things,
and immediately, we began making a solar-powered plane
because we felt solar power was going to be so important
for the country and the world,
we didn't want the small funding in the government to be decreased,
which is what the government was trying to do with it.
And we thought a solar-powered plane wouldn't really make sense,
but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power
and maybe help that field.
And that project continued, did succeed,
and we then got into other projects in aviation
and mechanical things and ground devices.
in 1982, I got a prize from the Lindbergh Foundation --
their annual prize --
and I had to prepare a paper on it,
which collected all my varied thoughts
and varied interests over the years.
This was the one chance that I had to focus on what I, really, was after,
and what was important. And to my surprise,
I realized the importance of environmental issues,
which Charles Lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to,
and preparing that paper did me a lot of good.
I thought back about if I was a space traveler,
and came and visited Earth every 5,000 years.
And for a few thousand visits, I would see the same thing every time,
the little differences in the Earth.
suddenly, there'd be huge changes in the environment,
in the concentration of people,
and it was just unbelievable, the amount of -- all the change in it.
I wanted to -- well, one of the biggest changes is, 200 years ago,
we began using coal from underground, which has a lot of pollution,
and 100 years ago, began getting gasoline from underground,
with a lot of pollution. And gasoline consumption, or production,
will reach its limit in about ten years, and then go down,
and we wonder what's going to happen with transportation.
this slide, I think, is the most important one any of you will see, ever, because --
(Laughter)
(Applause) --
it shows nature versus humans, and goes from 1850 to 2050.
And so, the year 2000, you see there.
And this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates.
Humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on, are --
the red line goes up. That's the humans and livestock and pets portion.
The green line goes down. That's the wild nature portion.
Humans, livestock and pets are, now, 98 percent of the total world's mass
of vertebrates on land and air.
And you don't know what the future will hold,
but it's not going to get a lower percentage.
Ten thousand years ago, the humans and livestock and pets
were not even one tenth of one percent
and wouldn't even have been visible on such a curve.
Now they are 98 percent, and it, I think, shows human domination of the Earth.
and ask them, after they've asked me questions,
and I give them a talk and so on. Then I ask them questions.
What's the population of the Earth?
What's the population of the Earth going to be
when you're the age of your parents?
Which I'd never, really -- they had never, really, thought about
but, now, they think about it.
And then, what population of the Earth would be an equilibrium
that could continue on, and be for 2050, 2100, 2150?
And they form little groups, all fighting with each other,
and when I leave, two hours later,
most of them are saying about 2 billion people,
and they don't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion,
nor do I, but I think they're right and this is a serious problem.
"Solar Manifesto" by Hermann Scheer, in Germany,
claims all energy on Earth can be derived, for every country,
from solar energy and water, and so on.
You don't need to dig down for these chemicals,
and we can do things much more efficiently.
Let's have the next slide.
So this just summarizes it. "Over billions of years,
on a unique sphere, chance has painted a thin covering of life --
complex and probable, wonderful and fragile.
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature,
have grown in population, technology and intelligence
to a position of terrible power. We, now, wield the paintbrush."
We're in charge. It's frightening.
And I do a painting every 20 or 25 years. This is the last one.
(Laughter)
And [it] shows the Earth in a time flag: on the right,
in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on;
and over the triangle, we now get to civilization and TV
and traffic jams and so on.
I have no idea of what comes next,
so I just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future,
as a little warning.
And two weeks after this drawing was done,
we actually had our first project contract, at AeroVironment,
on robotic cockroaches, which was very frightening to me.
(Paper rustling)
As time went on, we stopped our environmental programs.
We focused more on the really serious energy problems
of the future, and we produced products for the company.
And we developed the impact car that General Motors made,
the EV1, out of --
and got the Air Resources Board to have the regulations
that stimulated the electric cars, but they've since come apart.
And we've done a lot of things, small drone airplanes and so on.
I have a Helios. We have the first video.
gives Helios' structure the flexibility and strength
to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere.
This enables her to easily ride through the air currents
to maximize the power from her solar array.
As the sky gets darker, and the outside air temperatures drop
below minus 100 degrees Fahrenheit,
the most environmentally hostile segment of Helios's journey
has gone by without notice,
except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems
and their associated sensors.
Approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet,
at 4:12 p.m., Helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the Earth's atmosphere.
This is more than 10,000 feet higher
than the previous world's altitude record held by the SR-71 Blackbird.
and it can fly so slowly that it'll just stay up at 65,000 feet.
Eventually, it will be able to have to stay up day, night, day, night,
for six months at a time, acting like the synchronous satellite,
but only ten miles above the Earth.
Let's have the next video. This shows the other end of the spectrum.
In effect a pair of roving eyeglasses,
a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead
if the operator is remote from the vehicle.
It is convenient to carry, assemble, and launch by hand.
Battery-powered, it is silent and rarely noticed.
It sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator.
With on-board GPS, it can navigate autonomously,
and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage.
Let's have the next video.
by meeting his son, Tyler, who, with his two brothers,
helped build the Gossamer Condor, 25 years ago.
they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own.
How old were you when you invented that?
and one of the first things,
the production version seemed to dive a little bit,
and so I would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit
before you try flying it.
I'll give you a demonstration of how it works.
The idea is that it soars on the lift over your body, like a seagull soaring on a cliff.
As the wind comes up, it has to go over the cliff, so
as you walk through the air, it goes around your body, some has to go over you.
And so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current.
The launch is the difficult part: you've got to hold it high up, over your head,
and you start walking forward, and just let go of it, and you can control it like that.
you can turn it left or right
just by putting the lift under one wing or another.
So I can do it -- oops, that was going to be a right turn.
Here, but --
(Applause) --
anyway.
(Applause)
And that's it, so you can just control it, wherever you want,
and it's just hours of fun. And these are no longer in production,
so you have real collector's items.
if we can get the video running on this, yeah --
just an example of a little video surveillance.
(Laughter) --
you can see how it just can fly around,
and you can spy on anybody you want.
but I was worried about hitting people in here,
so I thought this would be a little bit more gentle.
And that's it, yeah, just a few inventions.
(Applause)
All right.
I want to argue to you that in fact, politics and religion,
which are the two primary factors --
not the sole, but overwhelmingly, the primary factors --
which are driving towards a war which looks extremely likely --
bordering on the inevitable at this point,
whether one is in favor of that or not --
that politics and religion are, in fact, themselves
better conceptualized as kinds of technology,
let's focus on the political system in particular question here,
which is the system of democracy.
Democracy, as a type of politics, is a technology
for the control and deployment of power.
You can deploy power in a wide range of ways.
The famous ones -- despotism is a good one;
anarchy is a way to not deploy the power in any organized way,
to do it in a radically diffused fashion;
and democracy is a set of technologies,
which have the effect of, in principle,
diffusing the power source to a large number of people
and then re-concentrating it in a smaller group of people who govern,
and who themselves are, in principle, authorized to govern
by virtue of what the broader public has done.
which is the religion that, in some direct sense,
can be said to be precipitating what we're about to enter.
Let me say parenthetically why I think that's the case,
because I think it's a potentially controversial statement.
I would put it in the following equation: no 9/11, no war.
At the beginning of the Bush administration,
when President Bush, now President Bush, was running for president,
he made it very clear that he was not interested in intervening broadly in the world.
In fact, the trend was for disengagement with the rest of the world.
After 9/11, the tables were turned.
And the president decided, with his advisors,
to undertake some kind of an active intervention in the world around us.
That began with Afghanistan,
and when Afghanistan went extremely smoothly and quickly,
a decision was made through the technology of democracy --
again, notice, not a perfect technology --
but through the technology of democracy
that this administration was going to push in the direction of another war --
this time, a war in Iraq.
is that we have to acknowledge that Islam,
as interpreted by a very, very small, extremely radical group of people,
was a precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --
the precipitating cause of the 9/11 attacks --
and as a consequence, at one degree of remove,
the precipitating cause of the coming war that we're about to be engaged in.
And I would add that bin Laden and his followers
are consciously devoted to the goal of creating a conflict between democracy,
or at least capitalist democracy, on the one hand,
and the world of Islam as they see and define it.
Well, it's a technology for, first, salvation in its most basic sense.
but it's also meant by the Islamists --
and I use that term to mean people who believe that Islam --
they follow the slogan, Islam is the answer to a wide range of questions,
whether they're social, or political, or personal, or spiritual.
Within the sphere of people who have that view,
and it's a large number of people in the Muslim world
who disagree with bin Laden in his application,
but agree that Islam is the answer.
Islam represents a way of engaging the world
through which one can achieve certain desirable goals.
And the goals from the perspective of Muslims are, in principle,
peace, justice and equality,
but on terms that correspond to traditional Muslim teachings.
by identifying either of these propositions --
rather, either of these phenomena, democracy or Islam -- as technologies.
I don't want to suggest that they are a single thing that you can point to.
And I think a good way to prove this
is simply to demonstrate to you what my thought process was
when deciding what to put on the wall behind me when I spoke.
And I ran immediately into a conceptual problem:
you can't show a picture of democracy.
You can show a slogan, or a symbol, or a sign that stands for democracy.
I had the same problem when I was designing the cover
of my forthcoming book, in fact --
what do you put on the cover to show democracy?
And the same problem with respect to Islam.
You can show a mosque, or you can show worshippers,
but there's not a straightforward way of depicting Islam.
That's because these are the kinds of concepts
that are not susceptible to easy representation.
It follows from that that all of the people in the world
who say that they are Muslims can, in principle,
subscribe to a wide range of different interpretations
of what Islam really is, and the same is true of democracy.
In other words, unlike the word hope,
which one could look up in a dictionary and derive origins for,
and, perhaps, reach some kind of a consensual use analysis,
these are essentially contested concepts.
They're ideas about which people disagree in the deepest possible sense.
And as a consequence of this disagreement,
it's very, very difficult for anyone to say,
"I have the right version of Islam."
You know, post-9/11, we were treated to the amazing phenomenon
of George W. Bush saying, "Islam means peace."
Well, so says George W. Bush.
Other people would say it means something else.
Some people would say that Islam means submission.
Other people would say it means an acknowledgement
or recognition of God's sovereignty.
There are a wide range of different things that Islam can mean.
And ostensibly, the same is true of democracy.
Some people say that democracy consists basically in elections.
Other people say no, that's not enough,
there have to be basic liberal rights: free speech, free press, equality of citizens.
These are contested points, and it's impossible to answer them by saying,
in a moment of great confrontation,
what does that mean?
Well, you could fit it into a range of different interpretative frameworks.
You could begin with the one that we began with a couple of days ago,
which was fear.
Fear is not an implausible reaction with a war just around the corner
and with a very, very high likelihood that many, many people are going to die
as a consequence of this confrontation --
a confrontation which many, many people
in the Muslim world do not want,
many, many people in the American democracy do not want,
many people elsewhere in the world do not want,
but which nonetheless is favored by a large enough number of people --
at least in the relevant space, which is the United States --
to actually go forward. So fear is not a crazy response at all.
And I think that that's, in fact, probably the first appropriate response.
is that there's also a hopeful response to this.
And the hopeful response derives from recognizing
that Islam and democracy are technologies.
And by virtue of being technologies, they're manipulable.
And they're manipulable in ways
that can produce some extremely positive outcomes.
What do I have in mind?
Well, all over the Muslim world there are people
who take Islam deeply seriously, people who care about Islam,
for whom it's a source either of faith, or of civilization, or of deep values,
or just a source of powerful personal identity,
who think and are saying loudly that Islam and democracy
are in fact not in conflict, but are in fact deeply compatible.
And these Muslims -- and it's the vast majority of Muslims --
disagree profoundly with bin Laden's approach, profoundly.
And they furthermore think overwhelmingly --
again one can't speak of every person, but overwhelmingly,
and one can find this by reading any of the sources
that they have produced, and they're all over the Internet
and in all sorts of languages -- one can see that they're saying
that their concern in their own countries is primarily to free up themselves
to have choice in the spheres of personal life,
in the sphere of economics, in the sphere of politics,
and, yes, in the sphere of religion,
which is itself closely regulated in most of the Muslim world.
that their disagreement with the United States
is that it, in the past and still in the present,
has sided with autocratic rulers in the Muslim world
in order to promote America's short-term interests.
Now, during the Cold War, that may have been
a defensible position for the United States to take.
That's an academic question.
It may be that there was a great war to be fought between West and East,
and it was necessary on the axis of democracy against communism.
And it was necessary in some way for these to contradict each other,
and as a consequence you have to make friends wherever you can get them.
But now that the Cold War is over,
there's nearly universal consensus in the Muslim world --
and pretty close to the same here in the United States,
if you talk to people and ask them --
that in principle, there's no reason that democracy and Islam cannot co-exist.
And we see this among activist, practical Muslims,
like the Muslims who are presently the elected,
parliamentary, democratic government of Turkey,
who are behaving pragmatically, not ideologically,
who are promoting their own religious values,
who are elected by their own people
because they were perceived as honest and sincere
because of their religious values,
but who do not think that Islam and a democratic system of governance
are fundamentally incompatible.
convinces us that it can't possibly be compatible
with what we consider the core of democracy --
namely, free political choice, basic liberty and basic equality.
But I'm here to tell you that technologies
are more malleable than that.
I'm here to tell you that many, many Muslims believe --
the vast majority, in fact -- in fact I think I would go so far as to say
that many Muslims in Saudi Arabia believe that the core values of Islam,
namely acknowledgement of God's sovereignty
and basic human equality before God,
are themselves compatible with liberty, equality and free political choice.
And there are Muslims, many Muslims out there, who are saying precisely this.
And they're making this argument wherever they're permitted to make it.
But their governments, needless to say, are relatively threatened by this.
And for the most part try to stop them from making this argument.
try to form a party known as the Center Party,
which advocated the compatibility of Islam and democracy.
They weren't even allowed to form a party.
They were actually blocked from even forming a party
under the political system there. Why?
Because they would have done extraordinarily well.
In the most recent elections in the Muslim world --
which are those in Pakistan, those in Morocco
and those in Turkey -- in each case,
people who present themselves to the electorate as Islamic democrats
were far and away the most successful vote-getters
every place they were allowed to run freely.
So in Morocco, for example, they finished third in the political race
but they were only allowed to contest half the seats.
So had they contested a larger number of the seats,
they would have done even better.
Now what I want to suggest to you is that the reason for hope in this case
is that we are on the edge of a real transformation in the Muslim world.
And that's a transformation in which many sincerely believing Muslims --
who care very, very deeply about their traditions,
who do not want to compromise those values --
believe, through the malleability of the technology of democracy
and the malleability and synthetic capability of the technology of Islam,
that these two ideas can work together.
What does it mean to say that there's an Islamic democracy?
Well, one thing is, it's not going to look identical
to democracy as we know it in the United States.
That may be a good thing, in light of some of the criticisms we've heard today --
for example, in the regulatory context -- of what democracy produces.
It will also not look exactly the way either the people in this room,
or Muslims out in the rest of the world --
I don't mean to imply there aren't Muslims here, there probably are --
conceptualize Islam.
It will be transformative of Islam as well.
And as a result of this convergence,
this synthetic attempt to make sense of these two ideas together,
there's a real possibility that, instead of a clash
of Islamic civilization -- if there is such a thing --
and democratic civilization -- if there is such a thing --
we'll in fact have close compatibility.
and you can't pretend that there isn't about to be a war
if you're talking about these issues.
The war has tremendous risks for the model that I'm describing
because it's very possible that as a consequence of a war,
many Muslims will conclude that the United States
is not the kind of place that they want to emulate
with respect to its forms of political government.
On the other hand, there's a further possibility that many Americans,
swept up in the fever of a war, will say, and feel, and think
that Islam is the enemy somehow --
that Islam ought to be construed as the enemy.
And even though, for political tactical reasons,
the president has been very, very good about saying that Islam is not the enemy,
nonetheless, there's a natural impulse when one enters war
to think of the other side as an enemy.
And one furthermore has the impulse to generalize, as much as possible,
in defining who that enemy is.
So the risks are very great.
even by, and I would say especially by, people
who are deeply skeptical about whether we should go to war in the first place.
Those who oppose the war ought to realize that if a war happens,
it cannot be the right strategy,
either pragmatically, or spiritually, or morally, to say after the war,
"Well, let's let it all run itself out, and play out however it wants to play out,
because we opposed the war in the first place."
That's not the way human circumstances operate.
You face the circumstances you have in front of you
and you go forward.
for people who are skeptical about the war,
it's especially important to recognize that in the aftermath of the war
there is a possibility for the government of the United States
and the Muslim peoples with whom it interacts
to create real forms of government that are truly democratic
and also truly Islamic.
And it is crucial -- it is crucial in a practical, activist way --
for people who care about these issues to make sure
that within the technology of democracy, in this system,
they exercise their preferences, their choices and their voices
to encourage that outcome.
That's a hopeful message,
but it's a message that's hopeful only if you understand it
as incurring serious obligation for all of us.
And I think that we are capable of taking on that obligation,
but only if we put what we can into it.
And if we do, then I don't think that the hope will be unwarranted altogether.
So, what I'd like to talk about is something
that was very dear to Kahn's heart, which is:
how do we discover what is really particular about a project?
How do you discover the uniqueness of a project as unique as a person?
Because it seems to me that finding this uniqueness
has to do with dealing with the whole force of globalization;
that the particular is central to finding the uniqueness of place
and the uniqueness of a program in a building.
where I was asked some years ago to do a science museum
on a site, right downtown by the river.
And I thought the secret of the site was to make the building of the river, part of the river.
Unfortunately, though, the site was separated from the river by McLean Boulevard
so I suggested, "Let's reroute McLean,"
and that gave birth instantly to Friends of McLean Boulevard.
(Laughter)
And it took six months to reroute it.
this astronomic observatory of Jantar Mantar in Jaipur
because I talked about what makes a building a building of science.
And it seemed to me that this structure -- complex, rich and yet
totally rational: it's an instrument -- had something to do with science,
and somehow a building for science should be different and unique and speak of that.
And so my first sketch after I left was to say,
"Let's cut the channel and make an island and make an island building."
And I got all excited and came back, and
they sort of looked at me in dismay and said, "An island?
This used to be an island -- Ackerman Island --
and we filled in the channel during the Depression to create jobs."
(Laughter)
"You can't put it all on an island;
some of it has to be on the mainland because
we don't want to turn our back to the community."
And there emerged a design: the galleries sort of forming an island
and you could walk through them or on the roof.
And there were all kinds of exciting features:
you could come in through the landside buildings,
walk through the galleries into playgrounds in the landscape.
If you were cheap you could walk on top of a bridge to the roof,
peek in the exhibits and then get totally seduced,
come back and pay the five dollars admission.
(Laughter)
And the client was happy -- well, sort of happy
because we were four million dollars over the budget, but essentially happy.
It was complex, but there was something capricious about its complexity.
It was, what I would say, compositional complexity,
and I felt that if I had to fulfill what I talked about --
a building for science -- there had to be some kind of a generating idea,
some kind of a generating geometry.
And this gave birth to the idea of having toroidal generating geometry,
one with its center deep in the earth for the landside building
and a toroid with its center in the sky for the island building.
A toroid, for those who don't know,
is the surface of a doughnut or, for some of us, a bagel.
And out of this idea started spinning off many,
many kinds of variations of different plans and possibilities,
and then the plan itself evolved in relationship to the exhibits,
and you see the intersection of the plan with the toroidal geometry.
And when there were complaints about budget, I said,
"Well, it's worth doing the island because you get twice for your money: reflections."
And here's the building as it opened,
with a channel overlooking downtown, and as seen from downtown.
And the bike route's going right through the building,
so those traveling the river would see the exhibits and be drawn to the building.
The toroidal geometry made for a very efficient building:
every beam in this building is the same radius, all laminated wood.
Every wall, every concrete wall is resisting the stresses and supporting the building.
Every piece of the building works.
These are the galleries with the light coming in through the skylights,
and at night, and on opening day.
(Applause)
In 1976, I was asked to design a children's memorial museum
in a Holocaust museum in Yad Vashem in Jerusalem,
which you see here the campus.
I was asked to do a building,
and I was given all the artifacts of clothing and drawings.
And I felt very troubled.
they are totally saturated with information
and to see yet another museum with information,
it would make them just unable to digest.
And so I made a counter-proposal:
descend through the rock into an underground chamber.
There's an anteroom with photographs of children who perished
and then you come into a large space.
There is a single candle flickering in the center;
by an arrangement of reflective glasses, it reflects into infinity in all directions.
You walk through the space, a voice reads the names,
ages and place of birth of the children.
This voice does not repeat for six months.
And then you descend to light and to the north and to life.
they'll think it's a discotheque. You can't do that."
And they shelved the project. And it sat there for 10 years,
and then one day Abe Spiegel from Los Angeles,
who had lost his three-year-old son at Auschwitz,
came, saw the model, wrote the check and it got built 10 years later.
I was on one of my monthly trips to Jerusalem
and I got a call from the foreign ministry saying,
"We've got the Chief Minister of the Punjab here.
He is on a state visit. We took him on a visit to Yad Vashem,
we took him to the children's memorial; he was extremely moved.
He's demanding to meet the architect. Could you come down and meet him in Tel Aviv?"
And I went down and Chief Minister Badal said to me,
I was very moved by what I saw today.
We are going to build our national museum to tell the story of our people;
we're about to embark on that.
I'd like you to come and design it."
But two weeks later, I was in this little town, Anandpur Sahib,
outside Chandigarh, the capital of the Punjab,
and the temple and also next to it the fortress
that the last guru of the Sikhs, Guru Gobind, died in
as he wrote the Khalsa, which is their holy scripture.
And I got to work and they took me somewhere down there,
nine kilometers away from the town and the temple,
and said, "That's where we have chosen the location."
The pilgrims come here by the hundreds of thousands --
they're not going to get in trucks and buses and go down there.
Let's get back to the town and walk to the site."
And I recommended they do it right there, on that hill
and this hill, and bridge all the way into the town.
And, as things are a little easier in India, the site was purchased within a week
and we were working.
(Laughter)
the permanent exhibits at one end, the auditorium, library,
and changing exhibitions on the other --
to flood the valley into a series of water gardens
and to link it all to the fort and to the downtown.
And the structures rise from the sand cliffs --
they're built in concrete and sandstones; the roofs are stainless steel --
they are facing south and reflecting light towards the temple itself,
pedestrians crisscross from one side to the other.
And as you come from the north, it is all masonry growing out of the sand cliffs
as you come from the Himalayas and evoking the tradition of the fortress.
and there was going to be groundbreaking.
And I came back and, lo and behold, the little model I'd left behind
had been built ten times bigger for public display on site
and ... the bridge was built!
(Laughter)
Within the working drawings!
And half a million people gathered for the celebrations;
you can see them on the site itself as the foundations are beginning.
I was renamed Safdie Singh. And there it is under construction;
there are 1,800 workers at work and it will be finished in two years.
Yad Vashem decided to rebuild completely the historic museum
because now Washington was built -- the Holocaust Museum in Washington --
and that museum is so much more comprehensive in terms of information.
And Yad Vashem needs to deal with three million visitors a year at this point.
They said, "Let's rebuild the museum."
But of course, the Sikhs might give you a job on a platter -- the Jews make it hard:
international competition, phase one, phase two, phase three.
(Laughter)
that a building the size of the Washington building --
50,000 square feet -- will sit on that fragile hill
and that we will go into galleries -- rooms with doors
and sort of familiar rooms -- to tell the story of the Holocaust.
And I proposed that we cut through the mountain. That was my first sketch.
Just cut the whole museum through the mountain --
come out on the other side of the mountain --
and then bring light through the mountain into the chambers.
a reception building and some underground parking.
You cross a bridge, you enter this triangular room, 60 feet high,
which cuts right into the hill
and extends right through as you go towards the north.
And all of it, then, all the galleries are underground,
and you see the openings for the light.
And at night, just one line of light cuts through the mountain,
And all the galleries,
as you move through them and so on, are below grade.
And there are chambers carved in the rock --
concrete walls, stone, the natural rock when possible -- with the light shafts.
This is actually a Spanish quarry, which sort of inspired
the kind of spaces that these galleries could be.
And then, coming towards the north, it opens up:
it bursts out of the mountain into, again, a view of light and of the city
and of the Jerusalem hills.
It's the headquarters for the Institute of Peace in Washington,
the U.S. Institute of Peace.
The site chosen is across from the Lincoln Memorial;
you see it there directly on the Mall. It's the last building on the Mall,
on access of the Roosevelt Bridge that comes in from Virginia.
That too was a competition, and it is something I'm just beginning to work on.
If it were to be anywhere in Washington,
it would be an office building, a conference center,
a place for negotiating peace and so on -- all of which the building is --
but by virtue of the choice of putting it on the Mall and by the Lincoln Memorial,
this becomes the structure that is the symbol of peace on the Mall.
And that was a lot of heat to deal with.
spaces where research goes on, conference centers,
a public building because it will be a museum devoted to peacemaking --
and these are the drawings that we submitted for the competition,
the plans showing the spaces which radiate outwards from the entry.
You see the structure as, in the sequence of structures on the Mall,
very transparent and inviting and looking in.
And then as you enter it again, looking in all directions towards the city.
And what I felt about that building is that it really was a building
that had to do with a lightness of being -- to quote Kundera --
that it had to do with whiteness,
it had to do with a certain dynamic quality and it had to do with optimism.
And this is where it is; it's sort of evolving.
which demands maybe new materials:
how to make it white, how to make it translucent, how to make it glowing,
how to make it not capricious.
And here studying, in three dimensions,
how to give some kind, again, of order, a structure;
not something you feel you could just change
because you stop the design of that particular process.
And so it goes.
(Applause)
I'd like to conclude by relating all of what I've said to the term "beauty."
And I know it is not a fashionable term these days,
and certainly not fashionable in the discourse of architectural schools,
but it seems to me that all this, in one way or the other, is a search for beauty.
Beauty in the most profound sense of fit.
I have a quote that I like by a morphologist, 1917,
Theodore Cook, who said, "Beauty connotes humanity.
We call a natural object beautiful because we see
that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function."
Well, I would have said the perfect fulfillment of purpose.
Nevertheless, beauty as the kind of fit; something that tells us
that all the forces that have to do with our natural environment
have been fulfilled -- and our human environment -- for that.
I wrote a poem, which seems to me to still hold for me today.
"He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity.
He who seeks order shall find gratification.
He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.
He who considers himself the servant of his fellow beings
shall find the joy of self-expression. He who seeks self-expression
shall fall into the pit of arrogance.
Arrogance is incompatible with nature.
Through nature, the nature of the universe and the nature of man,
we shall seek truth. If we seek truth, we shall find beauty."
If you ask people about what part of psychology do they think is hard,
and you say, "Well, what about thinking and emotions?"
Most people will say, "Emotions are terribly hard.
They're incredibly complex. They can't -- I have no idea of how they work.
But thinking is really very straightforward:
it's just sort of some kind of logical reasoning, or something.
But that's not the hard part."
One nice problem is, what do we do about health?
The other day, I was reading something, and the person said
probably the largest single cause of disease is handshaking in the West.
And there was a little study about people who don't handshake,
and comparing them with ones who do handshake.
And I haven't the foggiest idea of where you find the ones that don't handshake,
because they must be hiding.
And the people who avoid that
have 30 percent less infectious disease or something.
Or maybe it was 31 and a quarter percent.
So if you really want to solve the problem of epidemics and so forth,
let's start with that. And since I got that idea,
I've had to shake hundreds of hands.
And I think the only way to avoid it
is to have some horrible visible disease,
and then you don't have to explain.
Well, the single best way is to get them to understand
that what they're being told is a whole lot of nonsense.
And then, of course, you have to do something
about how to moderate that, so that anybody can -- so they'll listen to you.
Pollution, energy shortage, environmental diversity, poverty.
How do we make stable societies? Longevity.
Okay, there're lots of problems to worry about.
and it's absolutely taboo -- is, how many people should there be?
And I think it should be about 100 million or maybe 500 million.
And then notice that a great many of these problems disappear.
If you had 100 million people
properly spread out, then if there's some garbage,
you throw it away, preferably where you can't see it, and it will rot.
Or you throw it into the ocean and some fish will benefit from it.
The problem is, how many people should there be?
And it's a sort of choice we have to make.
and there's these cube laws. So if you make them this big,
by using nanotechnology, I suppose --
(Laughter)
-- then you could have a thousand times as many.
That would solve the problem, but I don't see anybody
doing any research on making people smaller.
Now, it's nice to reduce the population, but a lot of people want to have children.
And there's one solution that's probably only a few years off.
You know you have 46 chromosomes. If you're lucky, you've got 23
from each parent. Sometimes you get an extra one or drop one out,
but -- so you can skip the grandparent and great-grandparent stage
and go right to the great-great-grandparent. And you have 46 people
and you give them a scanner, or whatever you need,
and they look at their chromosomes and each of them says
which one he likes best, or she -- no reason to have just two sexes
any more, even. So each child has 46 parents,
and I suppose you could let each group of 46 parents have 15 children.
Wouldn't that be enough? And then the children
would get plenty of support, and nurturing, and mentoring,
and the world population would decline very rapidly
and everybody would be totally happy.
And there's this great novel that Arthur Clarke wrote twice,
called "Against the Fall of Night" and "The City and the Stars."
They're both wonderful and largely the same,
except that computers happened in between.
And Arthur was looking at this old book, and he said, "Well, that was wrong.
The future must have some computers."
So in the second version of it, there are 100 billion
or 1,000 billion people on Earth, but they're all stored on hard disks or floppies,
or whatever they have in the future.
And you let a few million of them out at a time.
A person comes out, they live for a thousand years
doing whatever they do, and then, when it's time to go back
for a billion years -- or a million, I forget, the numbers don't matter --
but there really aren't very many people on Earth at a time.
And you get to think about yourself and your memories,
and before you go back into suspension, you edit your memories
and you change your personality and so forth.
The plot of the book is that there's not enough diversity,
so that the people who designed the city
make sure that every now and then an entirely new person is created.
And in the novel, a particular one named Alvin is created. And he says,
maybe this isn't the best way, and wrecks the whole system.
are good enough or smart enough.
I think the big problem is that we're not smart enough
to understand which of the problems we're facing are good enough.
Therefore, we have to build super intelligent machines like HAL.
As you remember, at some point in the book for "2001,"
HAL realizes that the universe is too big, and grand, and profound
for those really stupid astronauts. If you contrast HAL's behavior
with the triviality of the people on the spaceship,
you can see what's written between the lines.
Well, what are we going to do about that? We could get smarter.
I think that we're pretty smart, as compared to chimpanzees,
but we're not smart enough to deal with the colossal problems that we face,
either in abstract mathematics
or in figuring out economies, or balancing the world around.
So one thing we can do is live longer.
And nobody knows how hard that is,
but we'll probably find out in a few years.
You see, there's two forks in the road. We know that people live
twice as long as chimpanzees almost,
and nobody lives more than 120 years,
for reasons that aren't very well understood.
But lots of people now live to 90 or 100,
unless they shake hands too much or something like that.
And so maybe if we lived 200 years, we could accumulate enough skills
and knowledge to solve some problems.
So that's one way of going about it.
And as I said, we don't know how hard that is. It might be --
after all, most other mammals live half as long as the chimpanzee,
so we're sort of three and a half or four times, have four times
the longevity of most mammals. And in the case of the primates,
we have almost the same genes. We only differ from chimpanzees,
in the present state of knowledge, which is absolute hogwash,
maybe by just a few hundred genes.
And whatever you do, don't read anything about genetics
that's published within your lifetime, or something.
(Laughter)
The stuff has a very short half-life, same with brain science.
And so it might be that if we just fix four or five genes,
we can live 200 years.
Or it might be that it's just 30 or 40,
and I doubt that it's several hundred.
So this is something that people will be discussing
and lots of ethicists -- you know, an ethicist is somebody
who sees something wrong with whatever you have in mind.
(Laughter)
And it's very hard to find an ethicist who considers any change
worth making, because he says, what about the consequences?
And, of course, we're not responsible for the consequences
of what we're doing now, are we? Like all this complaint about clones.
And yet two random people will mate and have this child,
and both of them have some pretty rotten genes,
and the child is likely to come out to be average.
Which, by chimpanzee standards, is very good indeed.
problem anyway. Because if people live 200 or 1,000 years,
then we can't let them have a child more than about once every 200 or 1,000 years.
And so there won't be any workforce.
And one of the things Laurie Garrett pointed out, and others have,
is that a society that doesn't have people
of working age is in real trouble. And things are going to get worse,
because there's nobody to educate the children or to feed the old.
And when I'm talking about a long lifetime, of course,
I don't want somebody who's 200 years old to be like our image
of what a 200-year-old is -- which is dead, actually.
which seem to have different functions.
Nobody knows how most of them work in detail,
but we do know that there're lots of different things in there.
And they don't always work together. I like Freud's theory
that most of them are cancelling each other out.
And so if you think of yourself as a sort of city
with a hundred resources, then, when you're afraid, for example,
you may discard your long-range goals, but you may think deeply
and focus on exactly how to achieve that particular goal.
You throw everything else away. You become a monomaniac --
all you care about is not stepping out on that platform.
And when you're hungry, food becomes more attractive, and so forth.
So I see emotions as highly evolved subsets of your capability.
Emotion is not something added to thought. An emotional state
is what you get when you remove 100 or 200
of your normally available resources.
less than thinking is immensely productive. And I hope,
in the next few years, to show that this will lead to smart machines.
And I guess I better skip all the rest of this, which are some details
on how we might make those smart machines and --
(Laughter)
-- and the main idea is in fact that the core of a really smart machine
is one that recognizes that a certain kind of problem is facing you.
This is a problem of such and such a type,
and therefore there's a certain way or ways of thinking
that are good for that problem.
So I think the future, main problem of psychology is to classify
types of predicaments, types of situations, types of obstacles
and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up.
So you see, it's almost like a Pavlovian --
we lost the first hundred years of psychology
by really trivial theories, where you say,
how do people learn how to react to a situation? What I'm saying is,
after we go through a lot of levels, including designing
a huge, messy system with thousands of ports,
we'll end up again with the central problem of psychology.
Saying, not what are the situations,
but what are the kinds of problems
and what are the kinds of strategies, how do you learn them,
how do you connect them up, how does a really creative person
invent a new way of thinking out of the available resources and so forth.
if we can get rid of all of the traditional approaches to artificial intelligence,
like neural nets and genetic algorithms
and rule-based systems, and just turn our sights a little bit higher to say,
can we make a system that can use all those things
for the right kind of problem? Some problems are good for neural nets;
we know that others, neural nets are hopeless on them.
Genetic algorithms are great for certain things;
I suspect I know what they're bad at, and I won't tell you.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
[SHIT]
when I was in Africa last year, my wife and I were driving around,
we had this wonderful guide,
who showed us something that surprised both of us,
and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination
that comes with the design of animals.
It turns out that in about the 1880s, the missionaries came to Africa
to spread the word of Christianity,
to teach English to the natives.
And they brought blackboards and chalk.
And I'd like you to imagine that that's a blackboard,
and I just used some chalk on there.
And they brought quite a bit of this stuff.
But over the years, the blackboards were fine,
but they ran out of chalk.
And this is a real crisis for them.
The hyena is probably the most perfectly designed
scavenging animal in the world.
It strip-mines carcasses, and it has amazing teeth,
because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones.
Now, the end product of that action is up on the board here.
What the missionaries would do is, they'd walk around
and they'd pick up hyena shit.
And the incredible thing about hyena shit is, it makes great chalk.
but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design.
What I'm here to talk about is the camel.
When I started talking to Richard
about what I was going to speak about,
I had recently come back from Jordan,
where I had an amazing experience with a camel.
There were four of us, two Bedouin drivers.
You can just imagine, this expanse is an ocean of sand,
105 degrees, one water bottle.
And we were driving in what they told us was their very, very best Jeep.
Didn't look like it to me.
And as we started to go through the desert,
the Jeep broke down.
The guys got out, they put the hood up,
they started working under the hood, got it going again.
About a hundred yards, it broke down.
This went on about 6-7 times, we were getting more and more alarmed,
we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert.
they flooded the engine.
And they said, "Ah, no problem! We just get out and walk."
And we said, "We get out and walk?"
One water bottle, remember, guys, four people.
And they said, "Yeah, yeah, we'll walk. We'll find some camels."
We got out and walked, and sure enough,
about half a mile, we came over the crest of this hill,
and there was a huge gathering of Bedouin with their camels.
The guy went up and started dickering,
and 10 dollars later, we had four camels.
They went down like elevators; we got on them.
They went back up, and the Bedouin, each Bedouin, four of them,
got behind each of the camels with a little whip.
And they started slashing away at the back of the camels,
and they started galloping.
And if you've ever been on a camel, it is a very, very uncomfortable ride.
There's also one other aspect about these camels.
About every 10 steps, they lean back
and try to take a chunk out of your leg.
and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg.
And eventually, three miles later, we arrived at our destination,
where a Jeep was supposed to meet us.
And the camels come down again like elevators,
we sort of clumsily get off,
and they, obviously, try to take another chunk out of my leg.
And I've developed a very wonderful relationship
with this creature by this point,
and I've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch.
And much meaner, by the way, than the Bedouin who greeted me
and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters
to take back to the States.
I said, "You know, maybe I should bring a camel.
It's the best designed animal in the world."
He went, "Nah. I don't think we want to be bringing a camel."
And you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel.
So I did the next best thing.
I went to the Washington Zoo.
Richard said, "I want you to get up close and personal with this camel.
I want you to inspect its mouth, look at its teeth.
Go underneath it. Go above it. Go around it.
Pull its tail up; take a look in there.
I want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can."
We went down there, and I took one look at this camel.
It is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut.
it is a scary, scary thing to behold.
And if Richard thought I was getting in the ring with that camel,
someone was smoking Bedouin high grade.
and I'm going to share this.
Chris, if you want to roll this film.
Then I'm going to show you
a little bit more about the design of camels.
with the TED National Geographic Camel Investigation Unit.
I'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine.
because I was around this camel all day.
See, now he's getting a little overexcited.
So we'll need to be very careful around him. Don't let him get you.
Now, you can see copious amounts of saliva in there.
I always called myself the unstable stable boy.
Their nose, you can see his nose is flared right now.
When they're in rut, they're similar to seals
in the way, like, a seal has to open its nose to breathe.
And they're similar. They have to consciously open their nose.
But not big; for instance, in zebras, they have a huge ear
that's very mobile, so they can actually turn them both around.
And they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision.
They use that to pinpoint sound.
The desert's extremely windy as well as being very cold.
So not only do they have the very long eyelashes,
but there's the secondary --
I guess you'd call it the [unclear] or whatever.
It's this hair that's above the eyes, and below it, it's longer.
They don't. They store fat.
Now, I'm not a chemist, but basically what happens
is the fat is oxidized by their breathing.
And that will turn it into actually usable water.
Like a lot of predators, they walk on their toes.
But there's a big fat pad in there that squishes out.
They're like sun shoes, but, you know, with sand.
Hooves? They don't have traditional hooves,
but they do have one, like, big nail.
But they use their tails a lot, especially in rut.
He will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around
and make him more attractive.
I don't know why that would be, but it works for them.
So, what the hell.
Generally, they poop wherever they want to,
but during their rut, they will defecate in perimeter areas.
I don't know if you've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants,
you know what I mean, like, "Br-r-r!"
These big, big rumbling sounds. He will do the same thing.
You can actually see, right here, it will vibrate.
We weigh our animals.
Unfortunately, he's a very aggressive animal,
so he's actually destroyed some of the scales.
We had these big things that I weigh the bison on, for instance.
I'm guessing that he's at least 1,600 pounds.
But I would put him closer to 2,000.
He's basically a walking mulch pile.
We're kind of like buds, but I'm also a male as well.
And it makes him very dangerous at this time of year.
Don't even think about it. Don't think about it!
Out! Out!
No.
Out!
Well, and you're glad I didn't show you this.
One of the other things about the camel's beautiful design
is that its penis points backwards.
That way the camel can dip its tail in the stream,
and just whacker the entire area around him.
And that's how he really marks his territory.
Now, what you also didn't see was that --
and you may have noticed in the pen beside him
and, by the way, the camel's name is Suki.
In the pen beside him is Jasmine.
Jasmine has been his mate for some time.
But on this particular occasion, it was very, very clear
that as horny as Suki was, Jasmine was having none of it.
And so we started thinking.
Well, if poor old Suki is in search of a mate,
what would Suki do to find the perfect mate?
But before I do, I just want to mention
that this animal truly is a sort of the SUV of the sand,
the ship of the desert.
It's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas
in which the camel is found, largely Mongolia and Sahara,
that there are 160 words in Arabic to describe the camel.
And if this is a creature that was designed by committee,
it's certainly been like no committee I've ever been on.
So here's what Suki would do in search of a mate.
Can you roll it, please?
Lusty beast desires attractive and sincere mate.
I'm seven feet, 2,000 lbs., with brown hair and eyes, long legs --
and I'm very well ... hung.
I'm TED Camel.
The perfect desert machine.
I'm smartly designed.
Eyelashes that keep out sand
and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper.
A distinguished nose --
with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust
and a groove that catches moisture.
Amazingly full lips --
that allow me to eat practically anything that grows.
Callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably.
Leathery chest pads that beat the heat.
Short fur that keeps my skin cool.
Long legs that allow heat to escape.
And my hump?
Ogden Nash once wrote:
"The camel has a single hump; the dromedary two,
or else the other way around. I'm never sure. Are you?"
Here's a hint:
Bactarian.
Dromedary.
My hump contains up to 80 lbs. of fat, but doesn't store H2O.
I'm built to last.
I'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry.
I usually won't sweat until my body reaches 105 ºF,
enough to fry an egg.
I'm able to lose 40% of my weight without dying.
(Most animals would if they lost half that much.)
I'll drink 5 to 7 gallons of water a day.
But go without for more than a month.
I'm powerful.
Able to pack up to 400 lbs. of cargo.
Outrun a horse --
And cover 26 miles on a good day.
Camelot.
Jackie O. once said that traveling by camel
made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane.
Yet my large, soft feet allow me to navigate sand.
(Is that why the Bedouin claim I can dance?)
I'm a good provider, too.
Bedouins call the camel the Gift of God.
No surprise.
Tents and rugs are made of my hair.
My dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory.
My dung is burned as fuel. My milk is used for cheese.
"Camels are like angels," a Bedouin once said.
which is probably the most important thing to take away.
Humans, the animal, are pretty lucky creatures because, by and large,
we really don't have to adapt to our environment;
we adapt our environment to us.
And we've seen that repeatedly through this conference,
not just this year, but in past years.
But this creature that you've just seen
ultimately adapts, and keeps adapting and adapting.
I think when you look at the animal kingdom,
that is one of the most remarkable things.
It doesn't have an environment that adapts to it;
it has to adapt to the environment.
I'm supposed to scare you, because it's about fear, right?
And you should be really afraid,
but not for the reasons why you think you should be.
You should be really afraid that --
if we stick up the first slide on this thing -- there we go -- that you're missing out.
thinking about Bush and thinking about the stock market,
you're going to miss one of the greatest adventures that we've ever been on.
And this is what this adventure's really about.
This is crystallized DNA.
is coded in that stuff.
And if you want to take a single crystal of DNA, it looks like that.
And we're just beginning to understand this stuff.
And this is the single most exciting adventure that we have ever been on.
It's the single greatest mapping project we've ever been on.
If you think that the mapping of America's made a difference,
or landing on the moon, or this other stuff,
it's the map of ourselves and the map of every plant
and every insect and every bacteria that really makes a difference.
And it's beginning to tell us a lot about evolution.
(Laughter)
and Richard Dawkins has written about this --
is, this is really a river out of Eden.
So, the 3.2 billion base pairs inside each of your cells
is really a history of where you've been for the past billion years.
And we could start dating things,
and we could start changing medicine and archeology.
It turns out that if you take the human species about 700 years ago,
white Europeans diverged from black Africans in a very significant way.
White Europeans were subject to the plague.
And when they were subject to the plague, most people didn't survive,
but those who survived had a mutation on the CCR5 receptor.
And that mutation was passed on to their kids
because they're the ones that survived,
so there was a great deal of population pressure.
In Africa, because you didn't have these cities,
you didn't have that CCR5 population pressure mutation.
We can date it to 700 years ago.
That is one of the reasons why AIDS is raging across Africa as fast as it is,
and not as fast across Europe.
And we're beginning to find these little things for malaria,
for sickle cell, for cancers.
And in the measure that we map ourselves,
this is the single greatest adventure that we'll ever be on.
And this Friday, I want you to pull out a really good bottle of wine,
and I want you to toast these two people.
Because this Friday, 50 years ago, Watson and Crick found the structure of DNA,
and that is almost as important a date
as the 12th of February when we first mapped ourselves,
but anyway, we'll get to that.
So, all you guys have heard about DNA, all the stuff that DNA does,
but some of the stuff we're discovering is kind of nifty
because this turns out to be the single most abundant species on the planet.
If you think you're successful or cockroaches are successful,
it turns out that there's ten trillion trillion Pleurococcus sitting out there.
And we didn't know that Pleurococcus was out there,
which is part of the reason
why this whole species-mapping project is so important.
Because we're just beginning to learn
where we came from and what we are.
And we're finding amoebas like this. This is the amoeba dubia.
And the amoeba dubia doesn't look like much,
except that each of you has about 3.2 billion letters,
which is what makes you you,
as far as gene code inside each of your cells,
and this little amoeba which, you know,
sits in water in hundreds and millions and billions,
turns out to have 620 billion base pairs of gene code inside.
So, this little thingamajig has a genome
that's 200 times the size of yours.
And if you're thinking of efficient information storage mechanisms,
it may not turn out to be chips.
It may turn out to be something that looks a little like that amoeba.
This funky little thing: people didn't used to think
that it was worth taking samples out of nuclear reactors
because it was dangerous and, of course, nothing lived there.
And then finally somebody picked up a microscope
and looked at the water that was sitting next to the cores.
And sitting next to that water in the cores
was this little Deinococcus radiodurans, doing a backstroke,
having its chromosomes blown apart every day,
six, seven times, restitching them,
living in about 200 times the radiation that would kill you.
And by now you should be getting a hint as to how diverse
and how important and how interesting this journey into life is,
and how many different life forms there are,
and how there can be different life forms living in
very different places, maybe even outside of this planet.
Because if you can live in radiation that looks like this,
that brings up a whole series of interesting questions.
We should have known that this existed
because this is the only bacteria that you can see to the naked eye.
So, this thing is 0.75 millimeters.
It lives in a deep trench off the coast of Namibia.
And what you're looking at with this namibiensis
is the biggest bacteria we've ever seen.
So, it's about the size of a little period on a sentence.
Again, we didn't know this thing was there three years ago.
We're just beginning this journey of life in the new zoo.
The reason why Ferroplasma is interesting is because it eats iron,
lives inside the equivalent of battery acid,
and excretes sulfuric acid.
So, when you think of odd life forms,
when you think of what it takes to live,
it turns out this is a very efficient life form,
and they call it an archaea. Archaea means "the ancient ones."
And the reason why they're ancient is because this thing came up
when this planet was covered
by things like sulfuric acid in batteries,
and it was eating iron when the earth was part of a melted core.
So, it's not just dogs and cats and whales and dolphins
that you should be aware of and interested in on this little journey.
that you're paying attention to stuff which is temporal.
I mean, George Bush -- he's going to be gone, alright? Life isn't.
Whether the humans survive or don't survive,
these things are going to be living on this planet or other planets.
And it's just beginning to understand this code of DNA
that's really the most exciting intellectual adventure
that we've ever been on.
Conservation group gets together,
tries to figure out how to breed an animal that's almost extinct.
They can't do it naturally, so what they do with this thing is
they take a spoon, take some cells out of an adult gaur's mouth, code,
take the cells from that and insert it into a fertilized cow's egg,
reprogram cow's egg -- different gene code.
When you do that, the cow gives birth to a gaur.
We are now experimenting with bongos, pandas, elands, Sumatran tigers,
and the Australians -- bless their hearts --
are playing with these things.
These are Tasmanian tigers. The last known one died at the Hobart Zoo.
But it turns out that as we learn more about gene code
and how to reprogram species,
we may be able to close the gene gaps in deteriorate DNA.
And when we learn how to close the gene gaps,
then we can put a full string of DNA together.
And if we do that, and insert this into a fertilized wolf's egg,
we may give birth to an animal
that hasn't walked the earth since 1936.
And then you can start going back further,
and you can start thinking about dodos,
and you can think about other species.
And in other places, like Maryland, they're trying to figure out
what the primordial ancestor is.
Because each of us contains our entire gene code
of where we've been for the past billion years,
because we've evolved from that stuff,
you can take that tree of life and collapse it back,
and in the measure that you learn to reprogram,
maybe we'll give birth to something
that is very close to the first primordial ooze.
And it's all coming out of things that look like this.
Huge gene sequencing facilities the size of football fields.
Some are public. Some are private.
It takes about 5 billion dollars to sequence a human being the first time.
Takes about 3 million dollars the second time.
We will have a 1,000-dollar genome within the next five to eight years.
That means each of you will contain on a CD your entire gene code.
And it will be really boring. It will read like this.
(Laughter)
The really neat thing about this stuff is that's life.
And Laurie's going to talk about this one a little bit.
Because if you happen to find this one inside your body,
you're in big trouble, because that's the source code for Ebola.
That's one of the deadliest diseases known to humans.
But plants work the same way and insects work the same way,
and this apple works the same way.
This apple is the same thing as this floppy disk.
Because this thing codes ones and zeros,
and this thing codes A, T, C, Gs, and it sits up there,
absorbing energy on a tree, and one fine day
it has enough energy to say, execute, and it goes [thump]. Right?
(Laughter)
And when it does that, pushes a .EXE, what it does is,
it executes the first line of code, which reads just like that,
AATCAGGGACCC, and that means: make a root.
Next line of code: make a stem.
Next line of code, TACGGGG: make a flower that's white,
that blooms in the spring, that smells like this.
In the measure that you have the code
and the measure that you read it --
and, by the way, the first plant was read two years ago;
the first human was read two years ago;
the first insect was read two years ago.
a little bacteria called Haemophilus influenzae.
In the measure that you have the source code, as all of you know,
you can change the source code, and you can reprogram life forms
so that this little thingy becomes a vaccine,
or this little thingy starts producing biomaterials,
which is why DuPont is now growing a form of polyester
that feels like silk in corn.
This changes all rules. This is life, but we're reprogramming it.
This is what you look like. This is one of your chromosomes.
And what you can do now is,
you can outlay exactly what your chromosome is,
and what the gene code on that chromosome is right here,
and what those genes code for, and what animals they code against,
and then you can tie it to the literature.
And in the measure that you can do that, you can go home today,
and get on the Internet, and access
the world's biggest public library, which is a library of life.
And you can do some pretty strange things
because in the same way as you can reprogram this apple,
if you go to Cliff Tabin's lab at the Harvard Medical School,
he's reprogramming chicken embryos to grow more wings.
Why would Cliff be doing that? He doesn't have a restaurant.
(Laughter)
is because when you used to play with lizards as a little child,
and you picked up the lizard, sometimes the tail fell off, but it regrew.
Not so in human beings:
you cut off an arm, you cut off a leg -- it doesn't regrow.
But because each of your cells contains your entire gene code,
each cell can be reprogrammed, if we don't stop stem cell research
and if we don't stop genomic research,
to express different body functions.
And in the measure that we learn how chickens grow wings,
and what the program is for those cells to differentiate,
one of the things we're going to be able to do
is to stop undifferentiated cells, which you know as cancer,
and one of the things we're going to learn how to do
is how to reprogram cells like stem cells
in such a way that they express bone, stomach, skin, pancreas.
And you are likely to be wandering around -- and your children --
on regrown body parts in a reasonable period of time,
in some places in the world where they don't stop the research.
from the person next to you by one in a thousand, but only three percent codes,
which means it's only one in a thousand times three percent,
very small differences in expression and punctuation
can make a significant difference. Take a simple declarative sentence.
(Laughter)
Right?
That's perfectly clear. So, men read that sentence,
and they look at that sentence, and they read this.
Okay?
Now, women look at that sentence and they say, uh-uh, wrong.
This is the way it should be seen.
(Laughter)
That's what your genes are doing.
That's why you differ from this person over here by one in a thousand.
Right? But, you know, he's reasonably good looking, but...
I won't go there.
You can do this stuff even without changing the punctuation.
You can look at this, right?
And they look at the world a little differently.
They look at the same world and they say...
(Laughter)
That's how the same gene code -- that's why you have 30,000 genes,
mice have 30,000 genes, husbands have 30,000 genes.
Mice and men are the same. Wives know that, but anyway.
You can make very small changes in gene code
and get really different outcomes,
even with the same string of letters.
That's what your genes are doing every day.
That's why sometimes a person's genes
don't have to change a lot to get cancer.
They will test any one of you for 60,000 genetic conditions.
That brings up questions of privacy and insurability
and all kinds of stuff, but it also allows us to start going after diseases,
because if you run a person who has leukemia through something like this,
it turns out that three diseases with
completely similar clinical syndromes
are completely different diseases.
Because in ALL leukemia, that set of genes over there over-expresses.
In MLL, it's the middle set of genes,
and in AML, it's the bottom set of genes.
And if one of those particular things is expressing in your body,
then you take Gleevec and you're cured.
If it is not expressing in your body,
if you don't have one of those types --
a particular one of those types -- don't take Gleevec.
It won't do anything for you.
Same thing with Receptin if you've got breast cancer.
Don't have an HER-2 receptor? Don't take Receptin.
Changes the nature of medicine. Changes the predictions of medicine.
Changes the way medicine works.
was this thing, and it turns out that
this is not so important any more.
The U.S. Library of Congress, in terms of its printed volume of data,
contains less data than is coming out of a good genomics company
every month on a compound basis.
Let me say that again: A single genomics company
generates more data in a month, on a compound basis,
than is in the printed collections of the Library of Congress.
This is what's been powering the U.S. economy. It's Moore's Law.
So, all of you know that the price of computers halves every 18 months
and the power doubles, right?
Except that when you lay that side by side with the speed
with which gene data's being deposited in GenBank,
Moore's Law is right here: it's the blue line.
This is on a log scale, and that's what superexponential growth means.
This is going to push computers to have to grow faster
than they've been growing, because so far,
there haven't been applications that have been required
that need to go faster than Moore's Law. This stuff does.
This is a map which was finished at the Harvard Business School.
One of the really interesting questions is, if all this data's free,
who's using it? This is the greatest public library in the world.
Well, it turns out that there's about 27 trillion bits
moving inside from the United States to the United States;
about 4.6 trillion is going over to those European countries;
about 5.5's going to Japan; there's almost no communication
between Japan, and nobody else is literate in this stuff.
It's free. No one's reading it. They're focusing on the war;
they're focusing on Bush; they're not interested in life.
So, this is what a new map of the world looks like.
That is the genomically literate world. And that is a problem.
In fact, it's not a genomically literate world.
You can break this out by states.
And you can watch states rise and fall depending on
their ability to speak a language of life,
and you can watch New York fall off a cliff,
and you can watch New Jersey fall off a cliff,
and you can watch the rise of the new empires of intelligence.
And you can break it out by counties, because it's specific counties.
And if you want to get more specific,
it's actually specific zip codes.
(Laughter)
Well, in Southern California it's happening in 92121. And that's it.
And that's the triangle between Salk, Scripps, UCSD,
and it's called Torrey Pines Road.
That means you don't need to be a big nation to be successful;
it means you don't need a lot of people to be successful;
and it means you can move most of the wealth of a country
in about three or four carefully picked 747s.
oh, by the way, the ones that are the same color are contiguous.
What's the net effect of this?
In an agricultural society, the difference between
the richest and the poorest,
the most productive and the least productive, was five to one. Why?
Because in agriculture, if you had 10 kids
and you grow up a little bit earlier and you work a little bit harder,
you could produce about five times more wealth, on average,
than your neighbor.
In a knowledge society, that number is now 427 to 1.
It really matters if you're literate, not just in reading and writing
in English and French and German,
but in Microsoft and Linux and Apple.
And very soon it's going to matter if you're literate in life code.
So, if there is something you should fear,
it's that you're not keeping your eye on the ball.
Because it really matters who speaks life.
That's why nations rise and fall.
the most productive nation on earth was Australia, per person.
And New Zealand was way up there. And then the U.S. came in about 1950,
and then Switzerland about 1973, and then the U.S. got back on top --
beat up their chocolates and cuckoo clocks.
And today, of course, you all know that the most productive nation
on earth is Luxembourg, producing about one third more wealth
per person per year than America.
Tiny landlocked state. No oil. No diamonds. No natural resources.
Just smart people moving bits. Different rules.
Here's how many people it takes to produce a single U.S. patent.
So, about 3,000 Americans, 6,000 Koreans, 14,000 Brits,
790,000 Argentines. You want to know why Argentina's crashing?
It's got nothing to do with inflation.
It's got nothing to do with privatization.
You can take a Harvard-educated Ivy League economist,
stick him in charge of Argentina. He still crashes the country
because he doesn't understand how the rules have changed.
Oh, yeah, and it takes about 5.6 million Indians.
Well, watch what happens to India.
India and China used to be 40 percent of the global economy
just at the Industrial Revolution, and they are now about 4.8 percent.
Two billion people. One third of the global population producing 5 percent of the wealth
because they didn't get this change,
because they kept treating their people like serfs
instead of like shareholders of a common project.
They didn't keep the people who were educated.
They didn't foment the businesses. They didn't do the IPOs.
Silicon Valley did. And that's why they say
that Silicon Valley has been powered by ICs.
Not integrated circuits: Indians and Chinese.
(Laughter)
It turns out that if you'd gone to the U.N. in 1950,
when it was founded, there were 50 countries in this world.
It turns out there's now about 192.
Country after country is splitting, seceding, succeeding, failing --
and it's all getting very fragmented. And this has not stopped.
In the 1990s, these are sovereign states
that did not exist before 1990.
And this doesn't include fusions or name changes or changes in flags.
We're generating about 3.12 states per year.
People are taking control of their own states,
sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse.
And the really interesting thing is,
you and your kids are empowered to build great empires,
and you don't need a lot to do it.
(Music)
And, given that the music is over, I was going to talk
about how you can use this to generate a lot of wealth,
and how code works.
Moderator: Two minutes.
(Laughter)
Juan Enriquez: No, I'm going to stop there and we'll do it next year
because I don't want to take any of Laurie's time.
But thank you very much.
than McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy's, combined --
so it kind of works out.
And Americans love their Chinese food so much,
on its shuttle menu for its astronauts.
If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie,
there's yellow and brown.
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste,
so they're not as sweet as our version.
So how did they get to the US?
Well, the short answer is, the Japanese immigrants came over,
and a bunch of the bakers introduced them --
including at least one in Los Angeles,
doesn't recognize it; he's kind of horrified.
He's retired, deaf and plays a lot of mah–jongg.
in fact, it is originally an Italian vegetable.
I went to his home town.
This is a billboard that says:
"Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso."
who are still in the town.
I showed them the pictures of General Tso Chicken,
because in their eyes he is, after all,
a famous Qing dynasty military hero.
So, you know, I realized when I was there,
General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America,
in that he's known for chicken and not war.
that chop suey is actually not known in China,
I like to say chop suey is the biggest culinary joke
one culture ever played on another,
"This dish is particularly popular
after that holiday you call 'Thanksgiving.'"
Let's go back to the mid-1800s,
when the Chinese first came to America.
in 1883 ran an article that asked,
but if you look at the popular imagery of the time,
not so outlandish.
So, with sentiments like these,
the Chinese Exclusion Act was passed between 1882 and 1902,
the only time in American history
So in a way, because the Chinese were attacked,
There's a lot of different mysteries and legends,
shows up in Chinatown, New York City, and says,
"I want you all to stop making chop suey,
And the way he tells it,
And as he said -- we would never print this today --
but basically, the American man has become very rich.
Now I've found him and I want my recipe back,
and I want everyone to stop making chop suey,
doesn't exist only in America.
served on all seven continents, even Antarctica,
because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station,
which is the main scientific station in Antarctica.
You see different varieties of Chinese food.
For example, there is French Chinese food,
where they serve salt and pepper frog legs.
This is a dish called "crispy shredded beef,"
There's Indian Chinese food, Korean Chinese food,
Japanese Chinese food,
and just ramenize them.
So, there's Peruvian Chinese food,
But you know what?
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing, I would argue,
to have three or four second-place winners,
people who match five or six Powerball numbers.
He said, "I got it from a fortune cookie."
Basically, of those 110 people,
There are a bunch of them, including Lee's China in Omaha --
it was three weeks ago, it was three months ago.
that converged at a fortune cookie and a Chinese restaurant.
actually have a big impact on the macro level.
McDonald's actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product.
from a restaurant in New York City.
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux,
sort of an open-source thing, right?
that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food,
depending on the region.
where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish.
What had happened was,
and Ray Kroc with McDonald's
and Asa Candler with Coca-Cola.
For example, Lem Sen, who introduced chop suey,
that those whose names are forgotten in history
So what I'm going to talk about is why we don't have a good brain theory,
but I also run a nonprofit scientific research institute
called the Redwood Neuroscience Institute in Menlo Park.
But this was, I admit, all an accident.
I decided I was not going to be in the computer industry.
and they had added Graffiti to it, and I'm sorry about that.
and I fell in love with brains.
You're just going to program computers, that's all.
So I got in the PhD program in biophysics.
I was like, I'm studying brains now. Well, I want to study theory.
and said, I'll have to work here for a while.
That's when I designed all those computer products.
I was having a family, and I would mature a bit,
and maybe the business of neuroscience would mature a bit.
Well, it took longer than four years. It's been about 16 years.
Well, there's lots of reasons people do science.
The most basic one is, people like to know things.
We're curious, and we go out and get knowledge.
Why do we study ants? It's interesting.
it'll tell us who we are.
Evolution did this and Copernicus did this,
or businesses or whatever.
This is one, too, because when we understand how brains work,
with tremendous benefits to society,
just like a fundamental technology.
Normal science is a nice balance between theory and experimentalists.
But if this is normal science, what does neuroscience look like?
You can't imagine how much detail we know about brains.
There were 28,000 people who went to the neuroscience conference this year,
and every one of them is doing research in brains.
Some say we still don't have enough data,
we need more information, there's all these things we don't know.
Well, I just told you there's data coming out of your ears.
We have so much information, we don't even know how to organize it.
What good is more going to do?
Maybe we'll be lucky and discover some magic thing, but I don't think so.
This is a symptom of the fact that we just don't have a theory.
We don't need more data, we need a good theory.
In fact, it looks like it's the same thing repeated over and over again.
It's not as complex as it looks. That's not the issue.
It's just a bunch of cells. You understand your liver.
It's got a lot of cells in it too, right?
So, you know, I don't think there's anything to that.
And finally, some people say,
and we now know that's really not true at all.
something really fundamental, and it is:
another reason why we don't have a good brain theory
But it got more manageable once they had a theory.
The best minds were stumped -- really smart people.
We're not smarter now than they were then;
it just turns out it's really hard to think of things,
It was an intuitive, strongly held belief that was wrong.
and it's going through the solar system at a million miles an hour --
cats are cats; dogs are dogs; people are people; plants are plants;
This is what evolution tells us. And it's true. It's kind of unbelievable.
And the same thing about tectonic plates.
All the mountains and the continents
that's kept us from understanding brains?
we're intelligent because of how we do things
Engineers and scientists like to look at systems like this.
They say, we have a thing in a box. We have its inputs and outputs.
The AI people said, the thing in the box is a programmable computer,
because it's equivalent to a brain.
It's an internal metric; there's an internal metric about us,
saying, do we understand the world, am I making predictions, and so on.
But you're being intelligent; you're understanding what I'm saying.
you know the word at the end of this
And we'll say it's a non-mammal, like a reptile,
say, an alligator; we have an alligator.
And the alligator has some very sophisticated senses.
It can run and hide. It has fears and emotions. It can eat you.
It can attack. It can do all kinds of stuff.
First thing that happened in evolution with mammals
is we started to develop a thing called the neocortex.
Neocortex means "new layer." It's a new layer on top of your brain.
It's the wrinkly thing on the top of your head
that got wrinkly because it got shoved in there and doesn't fit.
And the memory system is sitting over the sensory part of the brain.
So as the sensory input comes in and feeds from the old brain,
It's sitting there saying, I'm going to memorize all the things going on:
in a similar environment, or the exact same environment,
they'll let you see what's going to happen next,
will let you hear the word "sentence" before I said it.
And it's this feeding back into the old brain
that will allow you to make more intelligent decisions.
And all the time you say, "Oh, I can predict things,"
so if you're a rat and you go through a maze, and you learn the maze,
in humans, it got a lot worse.
Humans actually developed the front of the neocortex,
It copied the posterior, the back part, which is sensory,
and put it in the front.
Humans uniquely have the same mechanism on the front,
but we use it for motor control.
I don't have time to explain, but to understand how a brain works,
In music, if you've heard a song before,
you anticipate it.
With an album, at the end of a song, the next song pops into your head.
It happens all the time, you make predictions.
It says, you have a door at home;
moving your doorknob over two inches.
It may take a second, but something happened.
I can change your doorknob in other ways --
is to build a door database with all the door attributes.
And as you go up to the door, we check them off one at time:
Your brain is making constant predictions all the time
about what will happen in your environment.
As I put my hand on this table, I expect to feel it stop.
When I walk, every step, if I missed it by an eighth of an inch,
You're constantly making predictions about your environment.
That's because you're making a prediction.
We test it by prediction: What is the next word in this ...?
First of all, we have to have the right framework.
And the framework is a memory framework,
not a computational or behavior framework,
and doesn't tell you exactly how it's working
First of all, it's going to be about memory.
Not like computer memory -- not at all like computer memory.
It's also memory of sequences:
The same techniques we use to build silicon computer memories,
we can use here.
But they're very different types of memories.
And we'll attach these memories to sensors,
and the sensors will experience real-live, real-world data,
and learn about their environment.
Not that robots aren't useful; people can build robots.
But the robotics part is the hardest part. That's old brain. That's really hard.
The new brain is easier than the old brain.
So first we'll do things that don't require a lot of robotics.
So you're not going to see C-3PO.
those are the things that will happen first.
But ultimately, the world's the limit.
I don't know how this will turn out.
but they didn't really know what was going to happen.
They just knew like, "We're going to build calculators
and traffic-light controllers.
are going to be a very fundamental technology,
and it will lead to unbelievable changes in the next 100 years.
When you think about resilience and technology it's actually much easier.
You're going to see some other speakers today, I already know,
who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff,
and, of course, with technology it never is.
So it's very easy, comparatively speaking, to be resilient.
I think that, if we look at what happened on the Internet,
A lot of how we decide, how we're supposed to react to things
and what we're supposed to expect about the future
depends on how we bucket things
and how we categorize them.
It's easy to think of this analogy as very different
from some of the other things you might pick.
For one thing, both were very real.
In 1849, in that Gold Rush, they took over $700 million
communicate with each other. It's a big deal.
Huge boom. Huge boom. Huge bust. Huge bust.
Sixty-eight rich men on the Steamer Portland. Stacks of yellow metal.
Some have 5,000. Many have more.
A few bring out 100,000 dollars each.
People would get very excited about this when they read these articles.
And the parallels between the Gold Rush and the Internet Rush continue very strongly.
So many people left what they were doing.
And what would happen is -- and the Gold Rush went on for years.
they thought, "Ah, this isn't real."
By about 1852, they're thinking, "Am I the stupidest person on Earth
by not rushing to California?" And they start to decide they are.
These are community affairs, by the way.
Local communities on the East Coast would get together and whole teams
of 10, 20 people would caravan across the United States,
and they would form companies.
he lived in Philadelphia and he took the Panama route.
They would take a ship down to Panama, across the isthmus,
and then take another ship north.
This guy, Dr. Toland, went by covered wagon to California.
This has its parallels, too. Doctors leaving their practices.
These are both very successful -- a physician in one case,
a surgeon in the other.
The San Francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak
because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon
So there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships.
And you saw some of the excesses
that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened.
The fort in San Francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers.
Half of them deserted to go look for gold.
"The struggle between right and six dollars a month
and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one."
And they didn't know how far they would really have to go,
and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff.
In fact it was so bad that most of the horses died
before they could get where they were going.
It got renamed the "Dead Horse Trail."
"Thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way,
sometimes in bunches under the cliffs,
with pack saddles and packs where they've fallen from the rock above,
sometimes in tangled masses, filling the mud holes
and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march,
often, I regret to say, exhausted, but still alive,
a fact we were unaware of, until after the miserable wretches
turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade.
The eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere
account for the myriads of ravens along the road.
cannot be imagined. They certainly cannot be described."
we had the same thing on the Internet: very bad burn rate calculations.
Bride #2: Then why does she have my invitation?
Announcer: Could be a really big deal to you. Husband #1: Is that your wife?
Husband #2: Not for another 15 minutes. Announcer: After all, it's your special day.
in the 2000 Super Bowl to air that ad,
Now, here's where our analogy with the Gold Rush starts to diverge,
and I think rather severely.
And that is, in a gold rush, when it's over, it's over.
They've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip, risked life, health and property,
spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform
Because when you take out that last piece of gold --
and they did incredibly quickly. I mean, if you look at the 1849 Gold Rush --
started to take gold out of there.
So there's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic
and that analogy is the electric industry.
And there are a lot of similarities between the Internet and the electric industry.
It's not a specific thing.
You know, it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power.
There's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity.
And the part of the electric revolution that I want to focus on
So the light bulb is what wired the world.
And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world.
All the streets had to be torn up.
This is work going on down in lower Manhattan
where they built some of the first electric power generating stations.
And they're tearing up all the streets.
The Edison Electric Company, which became Edison General Electric,
paid for all of this digging up of the streets. It was incredibly expensive.
Because, remember, the Web got to stand
So all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure --
I'm going back now to, sort of, the explosive part of the Web in 1994,
when it was growing 2,300 percent a year.
How could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994
when people weren't really investing in the Web?
Well, it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down.
and then home appliances started coming into being.
By the way, this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit.
So it wasn't a big seller.
the 1905 Skinner Vacuum.
These never really caught on either:
maybe it's time to give this one another shot.
(Laughter)
I thought that would really work, to give that another shot.
Now, the toaster was huge
because they used to make toast on open fires,
and it took a lot of time and attention.
All the appliances plug in there. And you would just unscrew your light bulb
if you wanted to plug in an appliance.
The next thing that really was a big, big deal was the washing machine.
Now, this was an object of much envy and lust.
Everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines.
And it would clean your clothes.
You'd keep this on your porch. It was a little bit messy and kind of a pain.
And you'd run a long cord into the house
where you could screw it into your light socket.
because they hadn't invented the off switch.
So you know, when you were done with it, you unscrewed it.
That's what you did. You didn't turn it off.
And as I said before, they hadn't invented the electric outlet either,
because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house.
And you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors
to be plugging things into a light socket like this.
But, you know, before I get too far into condemning our ancestors,
I thought I'd show you: this is my conference room.
This is a total kludge, if you ask me.
This is what it looks like under my desk.
I took this picture just two days ago.
And, you know, we think it's getting better,
And that's assuming you already have DSL in your house.
Try to get DSL installed in your house.
They have to -- typically, they come three times.
because then they had to wait on hold for an hour
for the purpose it's being put to --
then you'd be pretty depressed right now
because the last nugget of gold would be gone.
But the good thing is, with innovation, there isn't a last nugget.
and I haven't even talked about user interfaces on the Web --
we are at the 1908 Hurley washing machine stage with the Internet.
but that's the level of primitiveness of where we are.
"All the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble."
My mom hates this picture.
And I do think there's more innovation ahead of us
than there is behind us.
And in 1917, Sears -- I want to get this exactly right.
And I think that's where we are.
We're very, very early. Thank you very much.
Good morning everyone. First of all, it's been fantastic
being here over these past few days.
And secondly, I feel it's a great honor to kind of wind up
this extraordinary gathering of people,
these amazing talks that we've had.
I feel that I've fitted in, in many ways,
to some of the things that I've heard.
I came directly here
from the deep, deep tropical rainforest in Ecuador,
where I was out -- you could only get there by a plane --
with indigenous people with paint on their faces
and parrot feathers on their headdresses,
where these people are fighting to try and keep the oil companies,
and keep the roads, out of their forests.
They're fighting to develop their own way of living within the forest
in a world that's clean, a world that isn't contaminated,
a world that isn't polluted.
And what was so amazing to me, and what fits right in
with what we're all talking about here at TED,
is that there, right in the middle of this rainforest,
was some solar panels -- the first in that part of Ecuador --
and that was mainly to bring water up by pump
so that the women wouldn't have to go down.
The water was cleaned, but because they got a lot of batteries,
they were able to store a lot of electricity.
So every house -- and there were, I think, eight houses
in this little community -- could have light
for, I think it was about half an hour each evening.
And there is the Chief, in all his regal finery, with a laptop computer.
(Laughter)
And this man, he has been outside, but he's gone back,
and he was saying, "You know, we have suddenly jumped into
a whole new era, and we didn't even know about the white man
50 years ago, and now here we are with laptop computers,
and there are some things we want to learn from the modern world.
We want to know about health care.
We want to know about what other people do -- we're interested in it.
And we want to learn other languages.
We want to know English and French and perhaps Chinese,
and we're good at languages."
So there he is with his little laptop computer,
but fighting against the might of the pressures --
because of the debt, the foreign debt of Ecuador --
fighting the pressure of World Bank, IMF, and of course
the people who want to exploit the forests and take out the oil.
And so, coming directly from there to here.
But, of course, my real field of expertise
lies in an even different kind of civilization --
I can't really call it a civilization.
A different way of life, a different being.
We've talked earlier -- this wonderful talk by Wade Davis
about the different cultures of the humans around the world --
but the world is not composed only of human beings;
there are also other animal beings.
And I propose to bring into this TED conference,
as I always do around the world, the voice of the animal kingdom.
Too often we just see a few slides, or a bit of film,
but these beings have voices that mean something.
And so, I want to give you a greeting,
as from a chimpanzee in the forests of Tanzania --
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh!
(Applause)
I've been studying chimpanzees in Tanzania since 1960.
During that time, there have been modern technologies
that have really transformed the way
that field biologists do their work.
For example, for the first time, a few years ago,
by simply collecting little fecal samples
we were able to have them analyzed -- to have DNA profiling done --
so for the first time, we actually know which male chimps
are the fathers of each individual infant.
Because the chimps have a very promiscuous mating society.
So this opens up a whole new avenue of research.
And we use GSI -- geographic whatever it is, GSI --
to determine the range of the chimps.
And we're using -- you can see that I'm not really into this kind of stuff --
but we're using satellite imagery
to look at the deforestation in the area.
And of course, there's developments in infrared,
so you can watch animals at night,
and equipment for recording by video,
and tape recording is getting lighter and better.
So in many, many ways, we can do things today
that we couldn't do when I began in 1960.
Especially when chimpanzees, and other animals
with large brains, are studied in captivity,
modern technology is helping us to search
for the upper levels of cognition in some of these non-human animals.
So that we know today, they're capable of performances
that would have been thought absolutely impossible
by science when I began.
I think the chimpanzee in captivity who is the most skilled
in intellectual performance is one called Ai in Japan --
her name means love --
and she has a wonderfully sensitive partner working with her.
She loves her computer --
she'll leave her big group, and her running water,
and her trees and everything.
And she'll come in to sit at this computer --
it's like a video game for a kid; she's hooked.
She's 28, by the way, and she does things with her computer screen
and a touch pad that she can do faster than most humans.
She does very complex tasks, and I haven't got time to go into them,
but the amazing thing about this female is
she doesn't like making mistakes.
If she has a bad run, and her score isn't good,
she'll come and reach up and tap on the glass --
because she can't see the experimenter --
which is asking to have another go.
And her concentration -- she's already concentrated hard
for 20 minutes or so, and now she wants to do it all over again,
just for the satisfaction of having done it better.
And the food is not important -- she does get a tiny reward,
like one raisin for a correct response --
but she will do it for nothing, if you tell her beforehand.
So here we are, a chimpanzee using a computer.
Chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans also learn human sign language.
But the point is that when I was first in Gombe in 1960 --
I remember so well, so vividly, as though it was yesterday --
the first time, when I was going through the vegetation,
the chimpanzees were still running away from me, for the most part,
although some were a little bit acclimatized --
and I saw this dark shape, hunched over a termite mound,
and I peered with my binoculars.
It was, fortunately, one adult male whom I'd named David Greybeard --
and by the way, science at that time was telling me that I shouldn't name the chimps;
they should all have numbers; that was more scientific.
Anyway, David Greybeard -- and I saw that
he was picking little pieces of grass and using them
to fish termites from their underground nest.
And not only that -- he would sometimes pick a leafy twig
and strip the leaves --
modifying an object to make it suitable for a specific purpose --
the beginning of tool-making.
The reason this was so exciting and such a breakthrough
is at that time, it was thought that humans,
and only humans, used and made tools.
When I was at school, we were defined as man, the toolmaker.
So that when Louis Leakey, my mentor, heard this news,
he said, "Ah, we must now redefine 'man,' redefine 'tool,'
or accept chimpanzees as humans."
(Laughter)
We now know that at Gombe alone, there are nine different ways
in which chimpanzees use different objects for different purposes.
Moreover, we know that in different parts of Africa,
wherever chimps have been studied,
there are completely different tool-using behaviors.
And because it seems that these patterns are passed
from one generation to the next, through observation,
imitation and practice -- that is a definition of human culture.
What we find is that over these 40-odd years
that I and others have been studying chimpanzees
and the other great apes, and, as I say, other mammals
with complex brains and social systems,
we have found that after all, there isn't a sharp line
dividing humans from the rest of the animal kingdom.
It's a very wuzzy line.
It's getting wuzzier all the time as we find animals doing things
that we, in our arrogance, used to think was just human.
The chimps -- there's no time to discuss their fascinating lives --
but they have this long childhood, five years
of suckling and sleeping with the mother,
and then another three, four or five years
of emotional dependence on her, even when the next child is born.
The importance of learning in that time, when behavior is flexible --
and there's an awful lot to learn in chimpanzee society.
The long-term affectionate supportive bonds
that develop throughout this long childhood with the mother,
with the brothers and sisters,
and which can last through a lifetime,
which may be up to 60 years.
They can actually live longer than 60 in captivity,
so we've only done 40 years in the wild so far.
And we find chimps are capable of true compassion and altruism.
We find in their non-verbal communication -- this is very rich --
they have a lot of sounds, which they use in different circumstances,
but they also use touch, posture, gesture,
and what do they do?
They kiss; they embrace; they hold hands.
They pat one another on the back; they swagger; they shake their fist --
the kind of things that we do,
and they do them in the same kind of context.
They have very sophisticated cooperation.
Sometimes they hunt -- not that often,
but when they hunt, they show sophisticated cooperation,
and they share the prey.
We find that they show emotions, similar to -- maybe sometimes the same --
as those that we describe in ourselves as happiness, sadness, fear, despair.
They know mental as well as physical suffering.
And I don't have time to go into the information
that will prove some of these things to you,
save to say that there are very bright students, in the best universities,
studying emotions in animals, studying personalities in animals.
We know that chimpanzees and some other creatures
can recognize themselves in mirrors -- "self" as opposed to "other."
They have a sense of humor, and these are the kind of things
which traditionally have been thought of as human prerogatives.
But this teaches us a new respect -- and it's a new respect
not only for the chimpanzees, I suggest,
but some of the other amazing animals with whom we share this planet.
Once we're prepared to admit that after all,
we're not the only beings with personalities, minds
and above all feelings, and then we start to think
about ways we use and abuse
so many other sentient, sapient creatures on this planet,
it really gives cause for deep shame, at least for me.
So, the sad thing is that these chimpanzees --
who've perhaps taught us, more than any other creature, a little humility --
are in the wild, disappearing very fast.
They're disappearing for the reasons
that all of you in this room know only too well.
The deforestation, the growth of human populations, needing more land.
They're disappearing because some timber companies
go in with clear-cutting.
They're disappearing in the heart of their range in Africa
because the big multinational logging companies have come in and made roads --
as they want to do in Ecuador
and other parts where the forests remain untouched --
to take out oil or timber.
And this has led in Congo basin, and other parts of the world,
to what is known as the bush-meat trade.
This means that although for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years,
people have lived in those forests, or whatever habitat it is,
in harmony with their world, just killing the animals they need
for themselves and their families --
now, suddenly, because of the roads,
the hunters can go in from the towns.
They shoot everything, every single thing that moves
that's bigger than a small rat; they sun-dry it or smoke it.
And now they've got transport; they take it on the logging trucks
or the mining trucks into the towns where they sell it.
And people will pay more for bush-meat, as it's called,
than for domestic meat -- it's culturally preferred.
And it's not sustainable, and the huge logging camps in the forest
are now demanding meat, so the Pygmy hunters in the Congo basin
who've lived there with their wonderful way of living
for so many hundreds of years are now corrupted.
They're given weapons; they shoot for the logging camps; they get money.
Their culture is being destroyed,
along with the animals upon whom they depend.
So, when the logging camp moves, there's nothing left.
We talked already about the loss of human cultural diversity,
and I've seen it happening with my own eyes.
And the grim picture in Africa -- I love Africa,
and what do we see in Africa?
We see deforestation;
we see the desert spreading; we see massive hunger;
we see disease and we see population growth in areas
where there are more people living on a certain piece of land
than the land can possibly support,
and they're too poor to buy food from elsewhere.
Were the people that we heard about yesterday,
on the Easter Island, who cut down their last tree -- were they stupid?
Didn't they know what was happening?
Of course, but if you've seen the crippling poverty
in some of these parts of the world
it isn't a question of "Let's leave the tree for tomorrow."
"How am I going to feed my family today?
Maybe I can get just a few dollars from this last tree
which will keep us going a little bit longer,
and then we'll pray that something will happen
to save us from the inevitable end."
So, this is a pretty grim picture.
The one thing we have, which makes us so different
from chimpanzees or other living creatures,
is this sophisticated spoken language --
a language with which we can tell children
about things that aren't here.
We can talk about the distant past, plan for the distant future,
discuss ideas with each other,
so that the ideas can grow from the accumulated wisdom of a group.
We can do it by talking to each other;
we can do it through video; we can do it through the written word.
And we are abusing this great power we have to be wise stewards,
and we're destroying the world.
In the developed world, in a way, it's worse,
because we have so much access to knowledge
of the stupidity of what we're doing.
Do you know, we're bringing little babies
into a world where, in many places, the water is poisoning them?
And the air is harming them, and the food that's grown
from the contaminated land is poisoning them.
And that's not just in the far-away developing world; that's everywhere.
Do you know we all have about 50 chemicals
in our bodies we didn't have about 50 years ago?
And so many of these diseases, like asthma
and certain kinds of cancers, are on the increase
around places where our filthy toxic waste is dumped.
We're harming ourselves around the world,
as well as harming the animals, as well as harming nature herself --
Mother Nature, that brought us into being;
Mother Nature, where I believe we need to spend time,
where there's trees and flowers and birds
for our good psychological development.
And yet, there are hundreds and hundreds of children
in the developed world who never see nature,
because they're growing up in concrete
and all they know is virtual reality,
with no opportunity to go and lie in the sun,
or in the forest, with the dappled sun-specks
coming down from the canopy above.
As I was traveling around the world, you know,
I had to leave the forest -- that's where I love to be.
I had to leave these fascinating chimpanzees
for my students and field staff to continue studying
because, finding they dwindled from about two million
100 years ago to about 150,000 now,
I knew I had to leave the forest to do what I could
to raise awareness around the world.
And the more I talked about the chimpanzees' plight,
the more I realized the fact that everything's interconnected,
and the problems of the developing world
so often stem from the greed of the developed world,
and everything was joining together, and making -- not sense,
hope lies in sense, you said -- it's making a nonsense.
How can we do it?
Somebody said that yesterday.
And as I was traveling around, I kept meeting young people who'd lost hope.
They were feeling despair,
they were feeling, "Well, it doesn't matter what we do;
eat, drink and be merry, for tomorrow we die.
Everything is hopeless -- we're always being told so by the media."
And then I met some who were angry,
and anger that can turn to violence,
and we're all familiar with that.
And I have three little grandchildren,
and when some of these students would say to me
at high school or university, they'd say, "We're angry,"
or "We're filled with despair, because we feel
you've compromised our future, and there's nothing we can do about it."
And I looked in the eyes of my little grandchildren,
and think how much we've harmed this planet since I was their age.
I feel this deep shame, and that's why in 1991 in Tanzania,
I started a program that's called Roots and Shoots.
There's little brochures all around outside,
and if any of you have anything to do with children and care about their future,
I beg that you pick up that brochure.
And Roots and Shoots is a program for hope.
Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny,
but to reach the sun they can break through brick walls.
See the brick walls as all the problems
that we've inflicted on this planet.
Then, you see, it is a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world
can break through, and can make this a better world.
And the most important message of Roots and Shoots
is that every single individual makes a difference.
Every individual has a role to play.
Every one of us impacts the world around us everyday,
and you scientists know that you can't actually --
even if you stay in bed all day, you're breathing oxygen
and giving out CO2, and probably going to the loo,
and things like that --
you're making a difference in the world.
So, the Roots and Shoots program
involves youth in three kinds of projects.
And these are projects to make the world around them a better place.
One project to show care and concern for your own human community.
One for animals, including domestic animals -- and I have to say,
I learned everything I know about animal behavior
even before I got to Gombe and the chimps from my dog, Rusty,
who was my childhood companion.
And the third kind of project: something for the local environment.
So what the kids do depends first of all, how old are they --
and we go now from pre-school right through university.
It's going to depend whether they're inner-city or rural.
It's going to depend if they're wealthy or impoverished.
It's going to depend which part, say, of America they're in.
We're in every state now, and the problems in Florida
are different from the problems in New York.
It's going to depend on which country they're in --
and we're already in 60-plus countries, with about 5,000 active groups --
and there are groups all over the place that I keep hearing about
that I've never even heard of, because the kids are taking the program
and spreading it themselves.
Why?
Because they're buying into it,
and they're the ones who get to decide what they're going to do.
It isn't something that their parents tell them,
or their teachers tell them.
That's effective, but if they decide themselves,
"We want to clean this river
and put the fish back that used to be there.
We want to clear away the toxic soil
from this area and have an organic garden.
We want to go and spend time with the old people
and hear their stories and record their oral histories.
We want to go and work in a dog shelter.
We want to learn about animals. We want ... "
You know, it goes on and on, and this is very hopeful for me.
As I travel around the world 300 days a year,
everywhere there's a group of Roots and Shoots of different ages.
Everywhere there are children with shining eyes saying,
"Look at the difference we've made."
And now comes the technology into it,
because with this new way of communicating electronically
these kids can communicate with each other around the world.
And if anyone is interested to help us, we've got so many ideas
but we need help -- we need help to create the right kind of system
that will help these young people to communicate their excitement.
But also -- and this is so important -- to communicate their despair,
to say, "We've tried this and it doesn't work, and what shall we do?"
And then, lo and behold, there's another group answering these kids
who may be in America, or maybe this is a group in Israel,
saying, "Yeah, you did it a little bit wrong. This is how you should do it."
The philosophy is very simple.
We do not believe in violence.
No violence, no bombs, no guns.
That's not the way to solve problems.
Violence leads to violence, at least in my view.
So how do we solve?
The tools for solving the problems are knowledge and understanding.
Know the facts, but see how they fit in the big picture.
Hard work and persistence --don't give up --
and love and compassion leading to respect for all life.
How many more minutes? Two, one?
Chris Anderson: One -- one to two.
Jane Goodall: Two, two, I'm going to take two.
(Laughter)
Are you going to come and drag me off?
(Laughter)
Anyway -- so basically, Roots and Shoots
is beginning to change young people's lives.
It's what I'm devoting most of my energy to.
And I believe that a group like this can have a very major impact,
not just because you can share technology with us,
but because so many of you have children.
And if you take this program out, and give it to your children,
they have such a good opportunity to go out and do good,
because they've got parents like you.
And it's been so clear how much you all care
about trying to make this world a better place.
It's very encouraging.
But the kids do ask me --
and this won't take more than two minutes, I promise --
the kids say, "Dr. Jane, do you really have hope for the future?
You travel, you see all these horrible things happening."
Firstly, the human brain -- I don't need to say anything about that.
Now that we know what the problems are around the world,
human brains like yours are rising to solve those problems.
And we've talked a lot about that.
Secondly, the resilience of nature.
We can destroy a river,
and we can bring it back to life.
We can see a whole area desolated,
and it can be brought back to bloom again, with time or a little help.
And thirdly, the last speaker talked about -- or the speaker before last,
talked about the indomitable human spirit.
We are surrounded by the most amazing people
who do things that seem to be absolutely impossible.
Nelson Mandela -- I take a little piece of limestone
from Robben Island Prison, where he labored for 27 years,
and came out with so little bitterness, he could lead his people
from the horror of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Even after the 11th of September -- and I was in New York
and I felt the fear -- nevertheless, there was so much human courage,
so much love and so much compassion.
And then as I went around the country after that and felt the fear --
the fear that was leading to people feeling
they couldn't worry about the environment any more,
in case they seemed not to be patriotic --
and I was trying to encourage them,
somebody came up with a little quotation from Mahatma Gandhi,
"If you look back through human history,
you see that every evil regime has been overcome by good."
And just after that a woman brought me this little bell,
and I want to end on this note.
She said, "If you're talking about hope and peace, ring this.
This bell is made from metal from a defused landmine,
from the killing fields of Pol Pot --
one of the most evil regimes in human history --
where people are now beginning to put their lives back together
after the regime has crumbled.
So, yes, there is hope, and where is the hope?
Is it out there with the politicians?
It's in our hands.
It's in your hands and my hands
and those of our children.
It's really up to us.
We're the ones who can make a difference.
If we lead lives where we consciously leave
the lightest possible ecological footprints,
if we buy the things that are ethical for us to buy
and don't buy the things that are not,
we can change the world overnight.
Thank you.
This was in an area called Wellawatta, a prime residential area in Colombo.
We stood on the railroad tracks
The tracks are elevated about eight feet from the waterline normally,
but at that point the water had receded
to a level three or four feet below normal.
I'd never seen the reef here before.
Some children jumped down and ran to the rock pools with bags.
They were trying to catch fish.
No one realized that this was a very bad idea.
I turned around to check on my friend's house.
Then someone on the tracks screamed.
Before I could turn around, everyone on the tracks was screaming and running.
The children managed to run back onto the tracks.
No one was lost there. But the water continued to climb.
In about two minutes, it had reached the level of the railroad tracks
and was coming over it. We had run about 100 meters by this time.
It continued to rise.
I saw an old man standing at his gate, knee-deep in water, refusing to move.
He said he'd lived his whole life there by the beach,
and that he would rather die there than run.
A boy broke away from his mother to run back into his house
to get his dog, who was apparently afraid.
An old lady, crying, was carried out of her house and up the road by her son.
The slum built on the railroad reservation
Since this was a high-risk location, the police had warned the residents,
and no one was there when the water rose.
But they had not had any time to evacuate any belongings.
For hours afterwards, the sea was strewn with bits of wood for miles around --
all of this was from the houses in the slum.
unless you've been reading lots and lots of news reports --
but in many places, after the tsunami, villagers were still terrified.
When what was a tranquil sea swallows up people, homes
and long-tail boats -- mercilessly, without warning --
and no one can tell you anything reliable about whether another one is coming,
I'm not sure you'd want to calm down either.
One of the scariest things about the tsunami
that I've not seen mentioned is the complete lack of information.
will be coming at exactly 1 p.m., or perhaps tonight, or perhaps ...
to catch a boat to the hospital.
We think that Phi Phi hospital was destroyed.
We think this boat is going to Phuket hospital,
but if it's too dangerous to land at its pier,
then perhaps it will go to Krabi instead, which is more protected.
We don't think another wave is coming right away.
I was tucked into the corner furthest away from the television,
but I strained to listen for information.
They reported that there was an 8.5 magnitude earthquake in Sumatra,
which triggered the massive tsunami.
Having this news was comforting in some small way
to understand what had just happened to us.
However, the report focused on what had already occurred
and offered no information on what to expect now.
In general, everything was merely hearsay and rumor,
and not a single person I spoke to for over 36 hours
because one of the things that happened in the wake of the tsunami was that,
although initially -- that is, in that first day --
there was actually a kind of dearth of live reporting, there was a dearth of live video
and some people complained about this.
They said, "The blogsters let us down."
What became very clear was that,
and we got a complete and powerful picture of what had happened
in a way that we never had been able to get before.
And what you had was a group of essentially unorganized, unconnected
writers, video bloggers, etc., who were able to come up with
a collective portrait of a disaster that gave us a much better sense
of what it was like to actually be there than the mainstream media could give us.
Now, I'm going to move now from this kind of --
the sublime in the traditional sense of the word,
that is to say, awe-inspiring, terrifying -- to the somewhat more mundane.
Because when we think about blogs,
I think for most of us who are concerned about them,
we're primarily concerned with things like politics, technology, etc.
And I want to ask three questions in this talk,
about what motivates people to do things?
The second is, Do blogs genuinely have the possibility
of accessing a kind of collective intelligence
that has previously remained, for the most part, untapped?
And then the third part is, What are the potential problems,
or the dark side of blogs as we know them?
and, of course, the Internet more generally --
and it's going to seem like a very obvious point,
but I think it is an important one to think about --
is that the people who are generating these enormous reams of content
every day, who are spending enormous amounts of time organizing,
linking, commenting on the substance of the Internet,
are doing so primarily for free.
They are not getting paid for it in any way other than in the attention and,
to some extent, the reputational capital that they gain from doing a good job.
because the traditional account of economic man would say that,
basically, you do things for a concrete reward, primarily financial.
But instead, what we're finding on the Internet --
and one of the great geniuses of it -- is that people have found a way
to work together without any money involved at all.
They have come up with, in a sense, a different method for organizing activity.
talks about this open-source model, which we're familiar with from Linux,
as being potentially applicable in a whole host of situations.
what you have is essentially a kind of an army of local journalists,
who are producing enormous amounts of material
And it's one that offers really interesting possibilities
for organizing a whole host of activities down the road.
is that we need to expand our idea of what counts as rational,
and we need to expand our simple equation of value equals money,
or, you have to pay for it to be good,
but that in fact you can end up with collectively really brilliant products
without any money at all changing hands.
There are a few bloggers -- somewhere maybe around 20, now --
who do, in fact, make some kind of money, and a few
but the vast majority of them are doing it because they love it
or they love the attention, or whatever it is.
So, Howard Rheingold has written a lot about this
and, I think, is writing about this more,
but this notion of voluntary cooperation
is an incredibly powerful one, and one worth thinking about.
in terms of accessing collective intelligence?
You know, as Chris mentioned, I wrote a book called "The Wisdom of Crowds."
And the premise of "The Wisdom of Crowds" is that,
under the right conditions, groups can be remarkably intelligent.
And they can actually often be smarter
than even the smartest person within them.
The simplest example of this is if you ask a group of people
to do something like guess how many jellybeans are in a jar.
If I had a jar of jellybeans
and I asked you all to guess how many jellybeans were in that jar,
your average guess would be remarkably good.
It would be somewhere probably within three and five percent
and it would be better than 90 to 95 percent of you.
There may be one or two of you who are brilliant jelly bean guessers,
And what's fascinating is that you can see this phenomenon at work
in many more complicated situations.
they predict almost perfectly how likely a horse is to win.
In a sense, the group of betters at the racetrack
is forecasting the future, in probabilistic terms.
You know, if you think about something like Google,
to seek out those sites that have the most valuable information --
we know that Google does an exceptionally good job of doing that,
and it does that because, collectively, this disorganized thing
we call the "World Wide Web" actually has a remarkable order,
And this, I think, is one of the real promises of the blogosphere.
is included in the gift pack --
has talked about it as saying that, as a writer,
he's recognized that his readers know more than he does.
And this is a very challenging idea. It's a very challenging idea
to mainstream media. It's a very challenging idea to anyone
who has invested an enormous amount of time and expertise,
and who has a lot of energy invested in the notion
But what the blogosphere offers is the possibility
of getting at the kind of collective, distributive intelligence that is out there,
and that we know is available to us
if we can just figure out a way of accessing it.
Each blog post, each blog commentary
may not, in and of itself, be exactly what we're looking for,
but collectively the judgment of those people posting, those people linking,
more often than not is going to give you a very interesting
That's the positive side of what is sometimes called
participatory journalism or citizen journalism, etc. --
that, in fact, we are giving people
who have never been able to talk before a voice,
and we're able to access information that has always been there
but has essentially gone untapped.
and that's what I want to spend the last part of my talk on.
One of the things that happens if you spend a lot of time on the Internet,
and you spend a lot of time thinking about the Internet,
is that it is very easy to fall in love with the Internet.
It is very easy to fall in love with the decentralized,
bottom-up structure of the Internet.
that being linked from one place to another,
that being tightly linked in a group, is a very good thing.
And much of the time it is.
But there's also a downside to this -- a kind of dark side, in fact --
and that is that the more tightly linked we've become to each other,
the harder it is for each of us to remain independent.
once you are linked in the network,
the network starts to shape your views
and starts to shape your interactions with everybody else.
That's one of the things that defines what a network is.
It is, as Steven Johnson has talked about, an emergent phenomenon.
Now, this has all these benefits:
it's very beneficial in terms of the efficiency of communicating information;
it gives you access to a whole host of people;
it allows people to coordinate their activities in very good ways.
when the people in them are as independent as possible.
This is the paradox of the wisdom of crowds,
or the paradox of collective intelligence,
that what it requires is actually a form of independent thinking.
And networks make it harder for people to do that,
because they drive attention to the things that the network values.
is that once a meme, once an idea gets going,
it is very easy for people to just sort of pile on,
because other people have, say, a link.
People have linked to it, and so other people in turn link to it, etc., etc.
of piling on the existing links
is one that is characteristic of the blogosphere,
particularly of the political blogosphere,
and it is one that essentially throws off
this beautiful, decentralized, bottom-up intelligence
that blogs can manifest in the right conditions.
A lot of people talk about ants.
no individual ant knows what it's doing,
but collectively ants are able to reach incredibly intelligent decisions.
They're able to reach food as efficiently as possible,
they're able to guide their traffic with remarkable speed.
So, the ant colony is a great model:
you have all these little parts that collectively add up to a great thing.
But we know that occasionally ants go astray,
and what happens is that, if army ants are wandering around and they get lost,
they start to follow a simple rule --
just do what the ant in front of you does.
And there's this famous example of one that was 1,200 feet long
and lasted for two days, and the ants just kept marching around and around
in a circle until they died.
And that, I think, is a sort of thing to watch out for.
That's the thing we have to fear --
is that we're just going to keep marching around and around until we die.
because one of the great things about the tsunami --
in terms of the blogosphere's coverage,
not in terms of the tsunami itself --
is that it really did represent a genuine bottom-up phenomenon.
You saw sites that had never existed before getting huge amounts of traffic.
You saw people being able to offer up their independent points of view
in a way that they hadn't before.
There, you really did see the intelligence of the Web manifest itself.
So, that's the upside. The circular mill is the downside.
And I think that the former is what we really need to strive for.
I'm a historian.
Steve told us about the future of little technology;
I'm going to show you some of the past of big technology.
This was a project to build a 4,000-ton nuclear bomb-propelled spaceship
and go to Saturn and Jupiter.
This took place in my childhood, 1957-65.
It was deeply classified.
I'm going to show you some stuff that not only has not been declassified,
but has now been reclassified.
and I'll have a lot more to show you, and if all doesn't go well,
I'll be in jail, like Wen Ho Lee.
a little taller and a little bigger.
And one of the people who worked on it at the beginning
was my father, Freeman, there in the middle.
That's me and my sister, Esther, who's a frequent TEDster.
I didn't like nuclear bomb-propelled spaceships.
I mean, I thought it was a great idea, but I started building kayaks.
So we had a few kayaks.
Just so you know that I am not Dr. Strangelove.
in odd, beautiful parts of this planet,
I always thought in the back of my mind about Project Orion,
and how my father and his friends were going to build these big ships.
They were actually going to go --
Ted Taylor, who led the project, was going to take his children.
My father was not going to take his children,
that was one of the reasons we sort of had a falling out for a few years.
that's right on the coast at La Jolla.
Look at that central building right in the middle of the picture.
That's the 130-foot diameter library.
That is exactly the size of the base of the spaceship.
So put that library at the bottom of that ship --
that's how big the thing was going to be.
It would take two or three thousand bombs.
The people who worked on it were a lot of the Los Alamos people
who had done the hydrogen bomb work.
It was the first project funded by ARPA.
That's the contract where ARPA gave the first million dollars
to get this thing started.
"Spaceship project officially begun. Job waiting for you. Dyson."
That's July '58.
Two days later, the space traveler's manifesto explaining why --
just like we heard yesterday -- why we need to go into space:
"... trips to satellites of the outer planets.
August 20, 1958."
Some of the sizes of the ships,
ranging all the way up to ship mass of 8 million tons.
So that was the outer extreme.
Here was version two: 2,000 bombs.
These are five-kiloton yield bombs, about the size of small Volkswagens;
it would take 800 to get into orbit.
Here we see a 10,000-ton ship will deliver 1,300 tons
to Saturn and back -- essentially, a five-year trip.
Possible departure dates: October 1960 to February 1967.
These are trajectories going to Mars.
All this was done by hand, with slide rules.
The little Orion ship,
and what it would take to do what Orion does with chemicals:
you have a ship the size of the Empire State Building.
The people who supported it were the Air Force,
which meant that it was all secret.
And that's why when you get something declassified, that's what it looks like.
Military weapon versions that carried hydrogen bombs
that could destroy half the planet.
There's another version there that sends retaliatory strikes at the Soviet Union.
This is the really secret stuff:
how to get directed energy explosions.
So you're sending the energy of a nuclear explosion --
not like just a stick of dynamite, but you're directing it at the ship.
And this is still a very active subject.
It's quite dangerous,
but I believe it's better to have dangerous things in the open
than think you're going to keep them secret.
The Air Force started to build smaller models
and actually started doing this.
The guys in La Jolla said, "We've got to get started now."
They built a high-explosive propelled model.
These are stills from film footage that was saved
by someone who was supposed to destroy it but didn't,
and kept it in their basement for the last 40 years.
So, these are three-pound charges of C4;
that's about 10 times what the guy had in his shoes.
So each of these coffee cans has three pounds of C4 in it.
They're building a system that ejects these at quarter-second intervals.
That's my dad in the sport coat there, holding the briefcase.
So, they had a lot of fun doing this.
But no children were allowed;
my dad could tell me he was building a spaceship and going to go to Saturn,
but he could not say anything more about it.
and spent the last four years tracking these old guys down.
These are stills from the video.
Jeff Bezos kindly, yesterday, said he'll put this video up
on the Amazon site -- some little clip of it.
They got quite serious about the engineering of this.
The size of that mass, for us,
is really large technology in a way we're never going to go back to.
If you saw the 1959 --
this is what it would feel like in the passenger compartment;
that's acceleration profile.
for an effective thrust of 10 million newtons.
Well, here we have a little problem, the radiation doses at the crew station:
700 rads per shot.
they were hoping to get clean bombs; they didn't.
Eyeburn: this is what happens to the people in Miami who are looking up.
it's basically like these sub-woofers.
And now we have ground-hazard assessments when you have a blow-up on the pad.
Finally, at the very end in 1964, NASA steps in and says,
"OK, we'll support a feasibility study for a small version
that could be launched with Saturn Vs in sections and pieced together."
getting an eight-man version that would go to Mars.
They liked it because the guys could kind of live there and be like,
"It's like living in a submarine."
This is crew compartment.
It switches, so what's upside down is right side up
when you go to artificial gravity mode.
The scientists were still going to go along;
they would take seven astronauts and seven scientists.
This is a 20-man version for going to Jupiter:
bunks, storm cellars, exercise room.
You know, it was going to be a nice, long trip.
This is the kind of stuff that's not been declassified,
just that people managed to sneak home and after, you know,
on their deathbed, basically, gave me that.
The sort of artist conceptions.
These are basically PowerPoint presentations
given to the Air Force 40 years ago.
Look at the little guys there outside the vehicle.
And one part of NASA was interested in it,
but the headquarters in NASA, they killed the project.
So finally, at the end,
we can see the thing followed its sort of design path right up to 1965,
and then all those paths came to a halt.
This project is hereby terminated.
So that's the end.
we heard yesterday that one of the 10 bad things that could happen to us
is an asteroid with our name on it.
And one of the bad things that could happen to NASA
is if that asteroid shows up with our name on it nine months out,
and everybody says,
"Well, what are we going to do?"
And Orion is really one of the only, if not the only,
off-the-shelf technologies that could do something.
The good news is that NASA has a small, secret contingency-plan division
that is looking at this, trying to keep knowledge of Orion preserved
in the event of such a misfortune.
Maybe keep a few little bombs of plutonium on the side.
That's the good news.
The bad news is, when I got in contact with these people
to try and get some documents from them, they went crazy
because I had all this stuff that they don't have,
and NASA purchased 1,759 pages of this stuff from me.
So that's the state we're at; it's not very good.
How will we be remembered in 200 years?
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,
which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:
the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,
and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.
It happened 225 years ago.
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.
The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,
and it was a very, very severe winter.
And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter
from hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.
What they remember is, of course, the great triumph,
that the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.
And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.
It's the child that's remembered.
And that's what we're going through at this time.
because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist --
so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.
(Laughter)
What I'm saying is that we should follow the model
that has been so successful with the electronic industry,
that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world
as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,
when kids could come home and play with them,
then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
-- there's a huge community of people in the world
who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,
pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,
people who handle biology with their hands,
and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,
plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,
and that will be an enormous positive step
to acceptance of biotechnology.
That will blow away a lot of the opposition.
When people have this technology in their hands,
you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own --
grow your dog, grow your own cat.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Just buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,
you can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and
I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,
becomes part of the human condition,
something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.
I want to talk about something quite different,
which is what I know about, and that is astronomy.
And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.
And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,
and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,
or whatever the time remains.
The important fact is, that most of the real estate
that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars,
I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach
for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --
most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.
it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between
the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,
but not very large. And it's not very promising for life,
since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.
It's not only cold, but very dry.
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.
the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is --
Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter,
where we see a very level ice surface,
which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.
So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate,
just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,
to go down through the ice,
find out who is swimming around in the ocean,
whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters --
whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,
so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there --
send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.
That's something we don't yet know how to do.
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.
way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,
in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud --
these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets
when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there
in the cold of the outer solar system,
but they are biologically very interesting indeed,
because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,
which are just the right ones for developing life.
So if life could be established out there,
it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight --
everything that's needed.
is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,
although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa,
and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,
just as it did on the Earth.
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,
finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great --
much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures
developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.
it could also have moved out onto the surface.
There wouldn't have been any air there -- it's a vacuum.
It is out in the cold, but it still could have come.
You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp
through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.
What would they need in order to grow on the surface?
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves
from losing water through the skin.
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.
But better -- what is more important
is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.
The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,
is 25 times fainter than it is here,
since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.
So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers,
which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have
either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.
Otherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,
which is certainly not favorable for developing life,
at least of the kind we know.
But if they just simply could grow, like leaves,
little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,
then they could keep warm on the surface.
They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight
and have roots going down into the ocean;
life then could flourish much more.
So, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely
that there's life on the surface of Europa.
None of these things is likely, but my,
my philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.
turning out to be there. And I mean,
the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began,
Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.
They said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,
but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough
and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate
that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,
and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,
so it certainly will not be detectable.
So there's no point in looking."
And that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy
by about 20 years.
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look.
Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look,
which was after about 20 years,
when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out
the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things
radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,
which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact
be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected
just because we haven't taken the trouble to look.
There is something called pit lamping.
That's the phrase which I learned from my son George,
who is there in the audience.
You take -- that's a Canadian expression.
If you happen to want to hunt animals at night,
you take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.
You strap it onto your forehead, so you can see
the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,
you shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.
You see the red glow in their eyes,
which is the reflection of the flashlight.
And then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,
you shoot the animals and take them home.
And of course, that spoils the game
for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,
so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,
because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,
because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.
So, the farmers go out at night
with heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,
and anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.
(Laughter)
to looking for life in the universe.
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces --
either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live
on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors --
in order to keep themselves warm.
And then, when you shine sunlight at them,
the sunlight will be reflected back,
just as it is in the eyes of an animal.
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.
And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,
the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,
this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger
as you go further away,
because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light
shines out even more in contrast against the dark background.
So as you go further away from the Sun,
this becomes more and more powerful.
So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.
we probably won't find anything,
none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,
it will transform our view of life altogether.
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there,
it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.
It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.
We're having great difficulties at the moment
and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.
Especially if you breathe air,
it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,
because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --
(Laughter)
-- you're dead --
(Laughter)
-- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.
of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,
this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the
smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,
and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there,
and you get knocked off the surface by a collision,
then it doesn't change anything all that much.
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight
and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.
And then if you run into another object, you can stay there
and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,
from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,
it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then
a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution --
so there'll be a huge advantage to the species
which is able to jump from one place to another
without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages
for spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.
I call these creatures sunflowers.
They look like, maybe like sunflowers.
They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,
and they will be able to spread out in space,
because gravity on these objects is weak.
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.
So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.
and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.
If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.
(Laughter)
That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.
We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding
of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your
take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit --
(Laughter) --
is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,
a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.
That would be a fun thing to do.
(Laughter)
In the long run, of course,
it would also make it possible for us to move out there.
What's going to happen in the end,
it's not going to be just humans colonizing space,
it's going to be life moving out from the Earth,
moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,
of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,
it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful
than it is today.
So again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.
Thank you.
(Applause)
And my aim, really, is to teach the world to listen.
That's my only real aim in life.
I will follow the instructions, the tempo markings, the dynamics.
And so therefore, because time is short,
And I'm being told the dynamic.
And I'm also being told that the drum is without snares.
Snares on, snares off.
or to talk about, even, from a teacher.
But it's the things you notice when you're not actually with your instrument
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about,
However, that's just the initial idea I may have that we all get
Just the basic feeling.
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not --
detached from the instrument and from the stick,
And I'm doing far, far less.
And I said, "Well, how do you hear it?"
And I said, "Well, I think I do too, but I also hear it through my hands,
and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through,
and they said, "Well, no, we won't accept you, because we haven't a clue,
you know, of the future of a so-called 'deaf musician.'"
if you refuse me through those reasons,
then we have to think very, very hard about the people you do actually accept."
who may be deaf, who may be blind, etc., etc. --
suddenly, if that young lad sits close to this instrument,
and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba,
and you play something that's so incredibly organ-like, almost --
I don't really have the right sticks, perhaps --
but something like this -- let me change --
because I'm on top of the sound.
He would have the sound coming through the resonators.
Exactly -- because I'm not even touching it.
Whatever the eye sees, then there's always sound happening.
So there's always, always that huge --
it may sound good up there, may not be so good there;
it may be great there, but terrible up there;
for which you can play exactly what you imagine,
without it being cosmetically enhanced.
for whom so many years, we've been saying,
In another year's time, three extra steps.
So when we do listen to each other,
but that doesn't mean I have the right to say it's a bad piece of music.
And you know, one of the great things about being a musician
is that it is so unbelievably fluid.
So there are no rules, no right, no wrong, this way, that way.
If I can just say, "Please clap and create the sound of thunder."
I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves.
However, not one of you got out of your seats to think,
"Right! How can I clap?
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds."
In the same way, when we listen to music,
we assume that it's all being fed through here.
And instead of him saying, "OK, Evelyn, please, feet slightly apart,
arms at a more or less 90-degree angle, sticks in a more or less V shape,
keep this amount of space here, etc.
Please keep your back straight, etc., etc., etc." --
I wasn't allowed to have these sticks.
I had to basically look at this particular drum,
Experimented with all sorts of things.
because where on earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music?
Where on earth are you going to experience that in a study book?
is basically, straightforward single-stroke rolls.
And that's exactly what he did.
You know, I need to say something.
I need to have the reason,
and the reason has to be by saying something through the music."
And by saying something through music, which basically is sound,
So please, the next time you go to a concert,
or the breath that's creating the sound from wind and brass.
of this particular conference, rather than just arriving last night.
Now, have any of y'all ever looked up this word?
You know, in a dictionary? (Laughter) Yeah, that's what I thought.
How about this word?
Here, I'll show it to you.
Lexicography: the practice of compiling dictionaries.
Notice -- we're very specific -- that word "compile."
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite,
out of a lump of rock. It's made up of lots of little bits.
It's little discrete --
that's spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits.
And those bits are words.
besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words,
like lexicographical.
Lexicographical has this great pattern:
it's called a double dactyl. And just by saying double dactyl,
I've sent the geek needle all the way into the red. (Laughter) (Applause)
But "lexicographical" is the same pattern as "higgledy-piggledy."
Right? It's a fun word to say,
and I get to say it a lot.
Now, one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer
is that people don't usually have a kind of warm, fuzzy, snuggly image of the dictionary.
Right? Nobody hugs their dictionaries.
But what people really often think about the dictionary is, they think more like this.
Just to let you know, I do not have a lexicographical whistle.
But people think that my job is to let the good words
make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary,
and keep the bad words out.
For one thing, I just do not do uniforms.
And for another, deciding what words are good
and what words are bad is actually not very easy.
And it's not very fun. And when parts of your job are not easy or fun,
you kind of look for an excuse not to do them.
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation
as a metaphor for my work, I would much rather be a fisherman.
I want to throw my big net into the deep, blue ocean of English
and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom.
But why do people want me to direct traffic, when I would much rather go fishing?
Well, I blame the Queen.
Why do I blame the Queen?
Well, first of all, I blame the Queen because it's funny.
But secondly, I blame the Queen because
dictionaries have really not changed.
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries
is our inclusion of the F-word, which has happened
in American dictionaries since 1965.
So, there's this guy, right? Victorian era.
James Murray, first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary.
I do not have that hat. I wish I had that hat.
So he's really responsible for a lot of
what we consider modern in dictionaries today.
When a guy who looks like that, in that hat,
is the face of modernity, you have a problem.
And so, James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today.
There'd be virtually no learning curve.
Computers! What about computers?
The thing about computers is, I love computers.
I mean, I'm a huge geek, I love computers.
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me.
But computers don't do much else other than
speed up the process of compiling dictionaries.
They don't change the end result.
Because what a dictionary is,
is it's Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion.
It's steampunk. What we have is an electric velocipede.
You know, we have Victorian design with an engine on it. That's all!
The design has not changed.
Online dictionaries must be different.
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online, one of the best online dictionaries.
This is my favorite word, by the way.
Erinaceous: pertaining to the hedgehog family; of the nature of a hedgehog.
Very useful word. So, look at that.
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen.
This is flat. Look how many links there are in the actual entry: two!
Right? Those little buttons,
I had them all expanded except for the date chart.
So there's not very much going on here.
There's not a lot of clickiness.
And in fact, online dictionaries replicate
almost all the problems of print, except for searchability.
And when you improve searchability,
you actually take away the one advantage of print, which is serendipity.
Serendipity is when you find things you weren't looking for,
because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult.
what we have here is a ham butt problem.
Does everyone know the ham butt problem?
Woman's making a ham for a big, family dinner.
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away,
and she looks at this piece of ham and she's like,
"This is a perfectly good piece of ham. Why am I throwing this away?"
She thought, "Well, my mom always did this."
So she calls up mom, and she says,
"Mom, why'd you cut the butt off the ham, when you're making a ham?"
She says, "I don't know, my mom always did it!"
So they call grandma, and grandma says,
"My pan was too small!" (Laughter)
We have a pan that's too small!
You know, that ham butt is delicious! There's no reason to throw it away.
The bad words -- see, when people think about a place
and they don't find a place on the map,
they think, "This map sucks!"
When they find a nightspot or a bar, and it's not in the guidebook,
they're like, "Ooh, this place must be cool! It's not in the guidebook."
When they find a word that's not in the dictionary, they think,
"This must be a bad word." Why? It's more likely to be a bad dictionary.
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan?
So, you can't get a smaller ham.
The English language is as big as it is.
and you're thinking about the ham butt problem,
the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive:
paper is the enemy of words.
How can this be? I mean, I love books. I really love books.
Some of my best friends are books.
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary.
Now they're going to think "Oh, boy.
People are going to take away my beautiful, paper dictionaries?"
No. There will still be paper dictionaries.
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation,
we didn't round up all the horses and shoot them.
You know, there're still going to be paper dictionaries,
but it's not going to be the dominant dictionary.
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape
dictionaries come in. And it's not going to be
the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in.
artificial constraints lead to
arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview.
What if biologists could only study animals
that made people go, "Aww." Right?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals,
and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study?
We'd know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna,
and not very much about much else.
And I think this is a problem.
I think we should study all the words,
because when you think about words, you can make beautiful expressions
from very humble parts.
Lexicography is really more about material science.
We are studying the tolerances of the materials
that you use to build the structure of your expression:
your speeches and your writing. And then, often people say to me,
"Well, OK, how do I know that this word is real?"
They think, "OK, if we think words are the tools
that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts,
how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer?"
They're just the right tools for the job.
You know, anybody who's read a children's book
knows that love makes things real.
If you love a word, use it. That makes it real.
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction.
It doesn't make a word any more real than any other way.
If you love a word, it becomes real.
So if we're not worrying about directing traffic,
if we've transcended paper, if we are worrying less
about control and more about description,
then we can think of the English language
as being this beautiful mobile.
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes,
is touched, any time you touch a word,
you use it in a new context, you give it a new connotation,
you verb it, you make the mobile move.
You didn't break it. It's just in a new position,
and that new position can be just as beautiful.
the problem with being a traffic cop is
there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection,
or the cars get confused. Right?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic,
but maybe to count the cars that go by, then more eyeballs are better.
You can ask for help!
If you ask for help, you get more done. And we really need help.
Library of Congress: 17 million books,
of which half are in English.
If only one out of every 10 of those books
had a word that's not in the dictionary in it,
that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries.
a word like "un-dictionaried," for example --
in almost every book I read. What about newspapers?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759,
58.1 million newspaper pages. If only one in 100
of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it,
it would be an entire other OED.
That's 500,000 more words. So that's a lot.
And I'm not even talking about magazines. I'm not talking about blogs --
and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week
than I do Newsweek or Time.
There's a lot going on there.
which is the greedy habit some words have of taking
more than one meaning for themselves.
So if you think of the word "set," a set can be a badger's burrow,
a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff,
and there's one numbered definition in the OED.
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set.
Tiny, little word, 33 numbered definitions.
One of them is just labeled "miscellaneous technical senses."
Do you know what that says to me?
That says to me, it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub. (Laughter)
That's a lexicographical cop out,
to say, "miscellaneous technical senses."
And the thing is, we could ask for help --
asking for help's not that hard.
I mean, lexicography is not rocket science.
See, I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers,
and this is more of a visual explanation.
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language,
these bright spots are what we know about,
and the dark spots are where we are in the dark.
If that was the map of all the words in American English, we don't know very much.
And we don't even know the shape of the language.
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English --
look, we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida,
but there's no California!
We're missing California from American English.
We just don't know enough, and we don't even know that we're missing California.
We don't even see that there's a gap on the map.
But even if it were, rocket science is being done
by dedicated amateurs these days. You know?
It can't be that hard to find some words!
So, enough scientists in other disciplines
are really asking people to help, and they're doing a good job of it.
For instance, there's eBird, where amateur birdwatchers
can upload information about their bird sightings.
And then, ornithologists can go
and help track populations, migrations, etc.
He's a director of an electroplating company.
He's found more than 140 comets.
He's found so many comets, they named a comet after him.
It's kind of out past Mars. It's a hike.
I don't think he's getting his picture taken there anytime soon.
But he found 140 comets without a telescope.
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite,
and that's how he found them.
If we can find comets without a telescope,
shouldn't we be able to find words?
Because I'm going to the Internet, which is where everybody goes.
And the Internet is great for collecting words,
because the Internet's full of collectors.
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet,
but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm.
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be
the recipe for lexicography. Isn't that great?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now,
but the problem with some of them is that they're not scientific enough.
They show the word, but they don't show any context.
Where did it come from? Who said it?
What newspaper was it in? What book?
If you don't know the provenance or the source of the artifact,
it's not science, it's a pretty thing to look at.
So a word without its source is like a cut flower.
You know, it's pretty to look at for a while, but then it dies.
It dies too fast.
So, this whole time I've been saying,
"The dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary, the dictionary."
Not "a dictionary," or "dictionaries." And that's because,
well, people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language.
They use it synecdochically.
And one of the problems of knowing a word like "synecdochically"
is that you really want an excuse to say "synecdochically."
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point
where I could say "synecdochically" to all of you.
So I'm really sorry. But when you use a part of something --
like the dictionary is a part of the language,
or a flag stands for the United States, it's a symbol of the country --
then you're using it synecdochically.
But the thing is, we could make the dictionary the whole language.
If we get a bigger pan, then we can put all the words in.
We can put in all the meanings.
Doesn't everyone want more meaning in their lives?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language --
we can make it be the whole language.
who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember
that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in.
This is what dictionaries used to look like.
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape.
It's a format that died because it wasn't useful enough.
It wasn't really what people needed.
And the thing is, if we can put in all the words,
no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad,
we can really describe the language like scientists.
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers.
If we can do that, then I can spend all my time fishing,
and I don't have to be a traffic cop anymore.
Thank you very much for your kind attention.
As you pointed out, every time you come here, you learn something.
This morning, the world's experts
from I guess three or four different companies on building seats,
I think concluded that ultimately, the solution is, people shouldn't sit down.
I could have told them that.
(Laughter)
Yesterday, the automotive guys gave us some new insights.
They pointed out that, I believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today,
they will be steering cars by wire,
without all that mechanical stuff.
(Laughter)
That's reassuring.
(Applause)
They then pointed out that there'd be, sort of, the other controls by wire,
to get rid of all that mechanical stuff.
That's pretty good, but why not get rid of the wires?
Then you don't need anything to control the car, except thinking about it.
I would love to talk about the technology,
and sometime, in what's past the 15 minutes,
I'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here
about what's in here.
But if I had one thing to say about this, before we get to first,
it would be that from the time we started building this,
the big idea wasn't the technology.
It really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it
in the iBOT for the disabled community.
The big idea here is, I think, a new piece of a solution
to a fairly big problem in transportation.
And maybe to put that in perspective: there's so much data on this,
I'll be happy to give it to you in different forms.
You never know what strikes the fancy of whom,
but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world.
And Henry Ford, just about 100 years ago, started cranking out Model Ts.
What I don't think most people think about
is the context of how technology is applied.
For instance, in that time, 91 percent of America
lived either on farms or in small towns.
So, the car --
the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal;
it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage.
It was half as long.
And it was an environmental improvement, because, for instance,
in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown Manhattan,
because you can imagine what the roads look like
when you have a million horses,
and a million of them urinating and doing other things,
and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable.
So the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy.
It also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm,
or their farm to a town, or from a town to a city.
It all made sense, with 91 percent of the people living there.
By the 1950s, we started connecting all the towns together
with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world, the highway system.
And it is certainly a wonder.
And by the way, as I take shots at old technologies,
I want to assure everybody, and particularly the automotive industry --
who's been very supportive of us --
that I don't think this in any way competes with airplanes, or cars.
But think about where the world is today.
50 percent of the global population now lives in cities.
That's 3.2 billion people.
We've solved all the transportation problems
that have changed the world to get it to where we are today.
500 years ago, sailing ships started getting reliable enough;
we found a new continent.
150 years ago, locomotives got efficient enough, steam power,
that we turned the continent into a country.
Over the last hundred years, we started building cars,
and then over the 50 years we've connected every city to every other city
in an extraordinarily efficient way,
and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that.
But during that entire process, more and more people have been born,
and more and more people are moving to cities.
China alone is going to move four to six hundred million people
into cities in the next decade and a half.
And so, nobody, I think, would argue that airplanes, in the last 50 years,
have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood.
And if you just look at how technology has been applied,
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed, high-volume,
large-weight problems of moving things around.
Nobody would want to give them up.
And I certainly wouldn't want to give up my airplane,
or my helicopter, or my Humvee, or my Porsche.
I love them all. I don't keep any of them in my living room.
The fact is, the last mile is the problem,
and half the world now lives in dense cities.
And people spend, depending on who they are,
between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot.
I think there's -- I don't know what data would impress you,
but how about, 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world
is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the United States.
Three million people die every year in cities due to bad air,
and almost all particulate pollution on this planet
is produced by transportation devices, particularly sitting in cities.
And again, I say that not to attack any industry,
I think -- I really do -- I love my airplane,
and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour
are extraordinarily efficient,
both from an engineering point of view,
an energy consumption point of view, and a utility point of view.
And we all love our cars, and I do.
The problem is, you get into the city and you want to go four blocks,
it's neither fun nor efficient nor productive.
It's not sustainable.
If -- in China, in the year 1998, 417 million people used bicycles;
1.7 million people used cars.
If five percent of that population became, quote, middle class,
and wanted to go the way we've gone in the last hundred years
at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities
of the size and density of Manhattan, every six weeks --
it isn't sustainable environmentally;
it isn't sustainable economically -- there just ain't enough oil --
and it's not sustainable politically.
I mean, what are we fighting over right now?
We can make it complicated, but what's the world fighting over right now?
So it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile,
and it was dumb luck. We were working on iBOTs,
but once we made this, we instantly decided
it could be a great alternative to jet skis. You don't need the water.
Or snowmobiles. You don't need the snow.
Or skiing. It's just fun, and people love to move around doing fun things.
And every one of those industries, by the way --
just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry.
But rather than go license this off, which is what we normally do,
it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology,
but into an understanding of a world that's solved all its other problems,
right back from ancient Greece on, were meant to walk around,
cities that were architected and built for people --
now have a footprint that,
while we've solved every other transportation problem --
and it's like Moore's law.
I mean, look at the time it took to cross a continent in a Conestoga wagon,
then on a railroad, then an airplane.
Every other form of transportation's been improved.
In 5,000 years, we've gone backwards in getting around cities.
They've gotten bigger; they're spread out.
The most expensive real estate on this planet in every city --
Wilshire Boulevard, or Fifth Avenue, or Tokyo, or Paris --
the most expensive real estate is their downtowns.
65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars.
The 20 largest cities in the world.
So you wonder, what if cities could give to their pedestrians
what we take for granted as we now go between cities?
What if you could make them fun, attractive, clean,
environmentally friendly?
What if it would make it a little bit more palatable
to have access via this, as that last link to mass transit,
to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs
and use our cars the way we want,
and then have our cities energized again?
We thought it would be really neat to do that,
and one of the problems we really were worried about
is: how do we get legal on the sidewalk?
Because technically I've got motors; I've got wheels -- I'm a motor vehicle.
I don't look like a motor vehicle.
I have the same footprint as a pedestrian;
I have the same unique capability
to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space.
I took this down to Ground Zero,
and knocked my way through crowds for an hour.
I'm a pedestrian. But the law typically lags technology by a generation or two,
and if we get told we don't belong on the sidewalk, we have two choices.
We're a recreational vehicle that doesn't really matter,
and I don't spend my time doing that kind of stuff.
Or maybe we should be out in the street
in front of a Greyhound bus or a vehicle.
We've been so concerned about that,
we went to the Postmaster General of the United States,
as the first person we ever showed on the outside,
and said, "Put your people on it. Everybody trusts their postman.
And they belong on the sidewalks, and they'll use it seriously."
He agreed. We went to a number of police departments
that want their police officers back in the neighborhood
on the beat, carrying 70 pounds of stuff. They love it.
And I can't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket.
(Laughter)
So we've been working really, really hard,
but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop
as an attitude about what's important, and how to apply the technology.
We went out and we found some visionary people
with enough money to let us design and build these things,
and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted.
So, I'm happy, really, I am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want.
And yes, it's really fun, and yes, you should all go out and try it.
But if I could ask you to do one thing,
it's not to think about it as a piece of technology,
but just imagine that, although we all understand somehow
that it's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine,
which can go 60 miles an hour,
that can bring you everywhere you want to go,
and somehow it's also what we used for the last mile,
and it's broken, and it doesn't work.
One of the more exciting things that occurred to us
about why it might get accepted, happened out here in California.
A few weeks ago, after we launched it,
we were here with a news crew on Venice Beach, zipping up and back,
and he's marveling at the technology,
and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by,
and skateboarders are zipping by,
and a little old lady -- I mean, if you looked in the dictionary,
a little old lady -- came by me --
and now that I'm on this, I'm the height of a normal adult now --
and she just stops, and the camera is there, and she looks up at me
and says, "Can I try that?"
And what was I -- you know, how are you going to say anything?
And so I said, "Sure."
So I get off, and she gets on, and with a little bit of the usual, ah,
then she turns around, and she goes about 20 feet,
and she turns back around, and she's all smiles.
And she comes back to me and she stops, and she says,
"Finally, they made something for us."
And the camera is looking down at her.
I'm thinking, "Wow, that was great --
(Laughter)
-- please lady, don't say another word."
(Laughter)
And the camera is down at her,
and this guy has to put the microphone in her face,
said, "What do you mean by that?"
And I figured, "It's all over now,"
and she looks up and she says, "Well,"
she's still watching these guys go; she says, "I can't ride a bike," no,
she says, "I can't use a skateboard, and I've never used roller blades,"
she knew them by name;
she says, "And it's been 50 years since I rode a bicycle."
Then she looks up, she's looking up, and she says,
"And I'm 81 years old, and I don't drive a car anymore.
I still have to get to the store, and I can't carry a lot of things."
And it suddenly occurred to me, that among my many fears,
were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators
and the legislators might not get it --
it was that, fundamentally, you believe there's pressure among the people
not to invade the most precious little bit of space left,
the sidewalks in these cities.
When you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk,
then the eight foot for the parked car, then the three lanes,
and then the other eight feet -- it's --
that little piece is all that's there.
But she looks up and says this,
and it occurs to me, well, kids aren't going to mind these things,
and they don't vote, and business people and then young adults
aren't going to mind these things -- they're pretty cool --
so I guess subliminally I was worried
that it's the older population that's going to worry.
So, having seen this, and having worried about it for eight years,
the first thing I do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys,
call AARP, get an appointment right away.
We've got to show them this thing.
And they took it to Washington; they showed them;
and they're going to be involved now,
watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities,
like Atlanta, where we're doing trials to see if it really can, in fact,
help re-energize their downtown.
(Applause)
The bottom line is, whether you believe the United Nations,
or any of the other think tanks --
in the next 20 years, all human population growth on this planet
will be in cities.
In Asia alone, it will be over a billion people.
They learned to start with cell phones.
They didn't have to take the 100-year trip we took.
They start at the top of the technology food chain.
We've got to start building cities and human environments
where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles
in a dense, rich, green-space environment,
without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it.
Cars were not meant for parallel parking;
they're wonderful machines to go between cities, but just think about it:
we've solved all the long-range, high-speed problems.
The Greeks went from the theater of Dionysus to the Parthenon in their sandals.
You do it in your sneakers.
Not much has changed.
If this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times --
a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes.
Your choice, when living in a city, if it's now 10 minutes --
because at 30 minutes you want an alternative, whether it's a bus, a train --
we've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail --
or you're going to keep parking those cars.
But if you could put a pin in most cities,
and imagine how far you could, if you had the time, walk in one half-hour, it's the city.
If you could make it fun, and make it eight or 10 minutes,
you can't find your car, un-park your car, move your car,
re-park your car and go somewhere;
you can't get to a cab or a subway.
We could change the way people allocate their resources,
the way this planet uses its energy,
make it more fun.
And we're hoping to some extent history will say we were right.
That's Segway. This is a Stirling cycle engine;
this had been confused by a lot of things we're doing.
This little beast, right now, is producing a few hundred watts of electricity.
Yes, it could be attached to this,
and yes, on a kilogram of propane,
you could drive from New York to Boston if you so choose.
Perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it'll burn any fuel,
because some of you might be skeptical
about the capability of this to have an impact,
where most of the world you can't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet.
We've been working on this,
actually, as an alternative energy source,
starting way back with Johnson & Johnson, to run an iBOT,
because the best batteries you could get --
10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead,
20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium,
40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride,
60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium,
8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline --
which is why nobody drives electric cars.
But, in any event, if you can burn it with the same efficiency --
because it's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove,
if you can burn any fuel, it turns out to be pretty neat.
It makes just enough electricity to, for instance, do this,
which at night is enough electricity, in the rest of the world,
as Mr. Holly -- Dr. Holly -- pointed out,
can run computers and a light bulb.
But more interestingly, the thermodynamics of this say,
you're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency.
It doesn't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity,
you'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat.
If you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour,
it takes about 25, a little over 25.3 kilowatt --
25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it.
That's so much energy, you couldn't afford to desalinate
or clean water in this country that way.
Certainly, in the rest of the world, your choice is to devastate the place,
turning everything that will burn into heat, or drink the water that's available.
The number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water.
Depending on whose numbers you believe,
it's between 60 and 85,000 people per day.
We don't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world.
We need water.
And women shouldn't have to spend four hours a day looking for it,
or watching their kids die.
We figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing,
with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat,
then using a little bit of the electricity control that process,
and for 450 watts, which is a little more than half of its waste heat,
it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water
from anything that comes into it to cool it.
So if we put this box on here in a few years,
could we have a solution to transportation, electricity,
and communication, and maybe drinkable water
in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds?
I don't know, but we'll try it.
I better shut up.
(Applause)
So I'm going to speak about a problem that I have
and that's that I'm a philosopher.
and I say, "I'm a professor," their eyes glaze over.
When I go to an academic cocktail party
and there are all the professors around, they ask me what field I'm in
and I say, "philosophy" -- their eyes glaze over.
their eyes don't glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl.
because they think, "That's impossible! You can't explain consciousness."
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking
that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question.
in one of his books, "Philosophical Explanations,"
is commenting on the ethos of philosophy --
the way philosophers go about their business.
And he says, you know, "Philosophers love rational argument."
And he says, "It seems as if the ideal argument
for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises
and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion,
and if they don't accept the conclusion, they die.
Their heads explode." The idea is to have an argument
that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents.
But in fact that doesn't change people's minds at all.
about something like consciousness,
and I finally figured out the reason for that.
The reason for that is that everybody's an expert on consciousness.
We heard the other day that everybody's got a strong opinion about video games.
They all have an idea for a video game, even if they're not experts.
But they don't consider themselves experts on video games;
they've just got strong opinions.
I'm sure that people here who work on, say, climate change
and global warming, or on the future of the Internet,
encounter people who have very strong opinions
about what's going to happen next.
But they probably don't think of these opinions as expertise.
They're just strongly held opinions.
But with regard to consciousness, people seem to think,
each of us seems to think, "I am an expert.
Simply by being conscious, I know all about this."
And so, you tell them your theory and they say,
"No, no, that's not the way consciousness is!
No, you've got it all wrong."
And they say this with an amazing confidence.
is to shake your confidence. Because I know the feeling --
I can feel it myself.
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds --
that you are, yourselves, authoritative about your own consciousness.
That's the order of the day here.
I think everybody understands what that means.
That's supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness.
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that's ever been done.
It's a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover.
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque.
That reminds him of the word baroque, barrack, bark, poodle,
Suzanne R. -- he's off to the races.
There's a wonderful stream of consciousness here
and if you follow it along, you learn a lot about this man.
What I particularly like about this picture, too,
is that Steinberg has rendered the guy
in this sort of pointillist style.
what we are, what each of us is -- what you are, what I am --
is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots.
That's what we're made of.
No other ingredients at all. We're just made of cells, about 100 trillion of them.
Not a single one of those cells is conscious;
not a single one of those cells knows who you are, or cares.
Somehow, we have to explain
how when you put together teams, armies, battalions
of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells --
not so different really from a bacterium, each one of them --
the result is this. I mean, just look at it.
The content -- there's color, there's ideas, there's memories,
there's history. And somehow all that content of consciousness
is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons.
How is that possible? Many people just think it isn't possible at all.
They think, "No, there can't be any
sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness."
who's a professor of religion, actually, at the University of Hawaii,
and he's an expert magician, and an expert
on the street magic of India, which is what this book is about,
"Net of Magic."
And there's a passage in it which I would love to share with you.
It speaks so eloquently to the problem.
"'I'm writing a book on magic,' I explain, and I'm asked, 'Real magic?'
By 'real magic,' people mean miracles,
thaumaturgical acts, and supernatural powers.
'No,' I answer. 'Conjuring tricks, not real magic.'
'Real magic,' in other words, refers to the magic that is not real;
while the magic that is real, that can actually be done, is not real magic."
If you're going to explain this as a bag of tricks,
then it's not real consciousness, whatever it is.
And, as Marvin said, and as other people have said,
"Consciousness is a bag of tricks."
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied
and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness.
So this is the problem. So I have to
do a little bit of the sort of work
that a lot of you won't like,
for the same reason that you don't like to see
a magic trick explained to you.
How many of you here, if somebody -- some smart aleck --
starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done,
you sort of want to block your ears and say, "No, no, I don't want to know!
Don't take the thrill of it away. I'd rather be mystified.
Don't tell me the answer."
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness, I've discovered.
And I'm sorry if I impose some clarity, some understanding on you.
You'd better leave now if you don't want to know some of these tricks.
I'm going to do what philosophers do.
Here's how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick.
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick?
The philosopher says, "I'm going to explain to you how that's done.
You see, the magician doesn't really saw the lady in half."
And you say, "Yes, and how does he do that?"
He says, "Oh, that's not my department, I'm sorry."
But I'm going to try to also show you
that consciousness isn't quite as marvelous --
your own consciousness isn't quite as wonderful --
as you may have thought it is.
This is something, by the way, that Lee Siegel talks about in his book.
He marvels at how he'll do a magic show, and afterwards
people will swear they saw him do X, Y, and Z. He never did those things.
He didn't even try to do those things.
People's memories inflate what they think they saw.
And the same is true of consciousness.
Watch it carefully.
I'm working with a young computer-animator documentarian
named Nick Deamer, and this is a little demo that he's done for me,
part of a larger project some of you may be interested in.
We're looking for a backer.
It's a feature-length documentary on consciousness.
OK, now, you all saw what changed, right?
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color?
Every one. I'll just show you by running it again.
Even when you know that they're all going to change color,
it's very hard to notice. You have to really concentrate
to pick up any of the changes at all.
of a phenomenon that's now being studied quite a bit.
It's one that I predicted in the last page or two of my
1991 book, "Consciousness Explained,"
where I said if you did experiments of this sort,
you'd find that people were unable to pick up really large changes.
If there's time at the end,
I'll show you the much more dramatic case.
Now, how can it be that there are all those changes going on,
and that we're not aware of them?
Well, earlier today, Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades,
the way your eye moves around three or four times a second.
He didn't mention the speed. Your eye is constantly in motion,
moving around, looking at eyes, noses, elbows,
looking at interesting things in the world.
And where your eye isn't looking,
you're remarkably impoverished in your vision.
That's because the foveal part of your eye,
which is the high-resolution part,
is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length.
That's the detail part.
It doesn't seem that way, does it?
It doesn't seem that way, but that's the way it is.
You're getting in a lot less information than you think.
It's in the museum in North Carolina.
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto's.
And I love paintings like that --
the painting is actually about as big as it is right here.
And I love Canalettos, because Canaletto has this fantastic detail,
and you can get right up
and see all the details on the painting.
And I started across the hall in North Carolina,
because I thought it was probably a Canaletto,
and would have all that in detail.
And I noticed that on the bridge there, there's a lot of people --
you can just barely see them walking across the bridge.
And I thought as I got closer
I would be able to see all the detail of most people,
see their clothes, and so forth.
And as I got closer and closer, I actually screamed.
I yelled out because when I got closer,
I found the detail wasn't there at all.
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint.
And as I walked towards the picture,
I was expecting detail that wasn't there.
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes
and wagons and all sorts of things,
and my brain had taken the suggestion.
you can get a better view of the blobs.
See, when you get close
they're really just blobs of paint.
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect.
I'll just give that to you one more time.
When an artful blob of paint or two, by an artist,
suggests a person -- say, one of
Marvin Minsky's little society of mind --
do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere?
I don't think so. Not a chance. But then, how on Earth is it done?
Well, remember the philosopher's explanation of the lady?
It's the same thing.
The brain just makes you think that it's got the detail there.
You think the detail's there, but it isn't there.
The brain isn't actually putting the detail in your head at all.
It's just making you expect the detail.
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right, rotated?
Yes.
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left
in your mind's eye, to see if it matched up with the one on the right?
How many of you rotated the one on the right? OK.
How do you know that's what you did?
raging for over 20 years in cognitive science --
various experiments started by Roger Shepherd,
who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images.
Yes, it's possible to do that.
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy.
And if you read that literature, one of the things
that you really have to come to terms with is
even when you're the subject in the experiment, you don't know.
You don't know how you do it.
You just know that you have certain beliefs.
And they come in a certain order, at a certain time.
And what explains the fact that that's what you think?
Well, that's where you have to go backstage and ask the magician.
You may think that I've cheated,
that I've put a little whiter-than-white boundary there.
How many of you see that sort of boundary,
with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles?
Can you see it?
Well, you know, in effect, the boundary's really there, in a certain sense.
Your brain is actually computing that boundary,
the boundary that goes right there.
But now, notice there are two ways of seeing the cube, right?
It's a Necker cube.
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube? OK.
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube?
Because there's another way of seeing it.
If you're seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles,
some black circles, there's another way of seeing it.
As a cube, on a black background,
as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese.
When you see the cube one way, behind the screen,
those boundaries go away.
But there's still a sort of filling in, as we can tell if we look at this.
We don't have any trouble seeing the cube, but where does the color change?
Does your brain have to send little painters in there?
The purple-painters and the green-painters
fight over who's going to paint that bit behind the curtain? No.
Your brain just lets it go. The brain doesn't need to fill that in.
When I first started talking about
the Bradley, Petrie, Dumais example that you just saw --
I'll go back to it, this one --
I said that there was no filling-in behind there.
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth, always true.
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn't.
I'll run this a few more times.
Look in the gray areas,
and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there --
yeah, it's amazing. There's nothing there. It's no trick.
["Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes" slide]
This is Ron Rensink's work, which was in some degree
inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book.
Let me just pause this for a second if I can.
What you're going to see is two pictures,
one of which is slightly different from the other.
You see here the red roof and the gray roof,
and in between them there will be a mask,
which is just a blank screen, for about a quarter of a second.
So you'll see the first picture, then a mask,
then the second picture, then a mask.
And this will just continue, and your job as the subject
is to press the button when you see the change.
So, show the original picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds. Blank.
And keep going, until the subject presses the button, saying,
"I see the change."
We're going to start easy. Some examples.
No trouble there.
Can everybody see? All right.
Indeed, Rensink's subjects took only a little bit more
than a second to press the button.
Can you see that one?
2.9 seconds.
How many don't see it still?
What's on the roof of that barn?
Is it a bridge or a dock?
There are a few more really dramatic ones, and then I'll close.
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking.
This one because it's so large and yet it's pretty hard to see.
Can you see it?
So 15.5 seconds is the median time
for subjects in his experiment there.
just because it's such an obvious and important thing.
How many still don't see it? How many still don't see it?
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing?
Thanks very much for your attention.
What I wanted to show you is that scientists,
using their from-the-outside, third-person methods,
can tell you things about your own consciousness
that you would never dream of,
and that, in fact, you're not the authority
on your own consciousness that you think you are.
And we're really making a lot of progress
on coming up with a theory of mind.
to get theory, and a good, big theory, into the neuroscience.
And he's right. This is a problem.
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk --
director of the lab said, "In our lab, we have a saying.
If you work on one neuron, that's neuroscience.
If you work on two neurons, that's psychology."
This is your conference,
and I think you have a right to know a little bit right now, in this transition period,
about this guy who's going to be looking after it for you for a bit.
So, I'm just going to grab a chair here.
I've come to this conclusion --
I think I may have been suffering from a strange delusion.
I think that I may have believed unconsciously,
then, that I was kind of a business hero.
I had this company that I'd spent 15 years building. It's called Future;
it was a magazine publishing company.
It had recently gone public
and the market said that it was apparently worth two billion dollars,
a number I didn't really understand.
A magazine I'd recently launched called Business 2.0
was fatter than a telephone directory,
busy pumping hot air into the bubble.
(Laughter)
And I was the 40 percent owner of a dotcom
that was about to go public and no doubt be worth billions more.
And all this had come from nothing.
Fifteen years earlier, I was a science journalist who people just laughed at
when I said, "I really would like to start my own computer magazine."
And 15 years later, there are 100 of them
and 2,000 people on staff and it was just such heady times.
The date was February 2000.
I thought the little graph of my business life
that kind of looked a bit like Moore's Law --
ever upward and to the right -- it was going to go on forever.
I mean, it had to. Right? I was in for quite a surprise.
was the very last consumer web company to go public
the next month before NASDAQ exploded, and I entered 18 months of business hell.
I watched everything that I'd built crumbling,
and it looked like all this stuff was going to die
and 15 years work would have come for nothing.
And it was gut wrenching.
It took eight years of blood, sweat and tears to reach 350 employees,
something which I was very proud of in the business.
February 2001 -- in one day we laid off 350 people,
and before the bloodshed was finished, 1,000 people had lost their jobs
from my companies. I felt sick.
I watched my own net worth falling
by about a million dollars a day, every day, for 18 months.
And worse than that, far worse than that,
my sense of self-worth was kind of evaporating.
I was going around with this big sign on my forehead: "LOSER."
(Laughter)
And I think what disgusts me more than anything, looking back,
is how the hell did I let my personal happiness
get so tied up with this business thing?
but I was, at that point, ready to move on.
And to cut a long story short, here's where I came to.
And the reason I'm telling this story is that I believe, from many conversations,
that a lot of people in this room have been through a similar kind of rollercoaster --
emotional rollercoaster -- in the last couple years.
This has been a big, big transition time,
and I believe that this conference can play a big part for all of us
in taking us forward to the next stage to whatever's next.
The theme next year is re-birth.
when Richard and I reached an agreement on the future of TED.
And at about the same time, and I think partly because of that,
I started doing something that I'd forgotten about in my business focus:
I started to read again.
And I discovered that while I'd been busy playing business games,
there'd been this incredible revolution in so many areas of interest:
cosmology to psychology to evolutionary psychology to anthropology
to ... all this stuff had changed.
And the way in which you could think about us as a species
and us as a planet had just changed so much, and it was incredibly exciting.
And what was really most exciting --
and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did --
was that all this stuff is connected.
It's connected; it all hooks into each other.
and I thought about trying to give an example of this. So, just one example:
Madame de Gaulle, the wife of the French president,
was famously asked once, "What do you most desire?"
And she answered, "A penis."
And when you think about it, it's very true:
what we all most desire is a penis --
or "happiness" as we say in English.
(Laughter)
And something ... good luck with that one in the Japanese translation room.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
which 20 years ago would have been just something for discussion
in the church or mosque or synagogue,
today it turns out that there's dozens of TED-like questions
that you can ask about it, which are really interesting.
You can ask about what causes it biochemically:
neuroscience, serotonin, all that stuff.
You can ask what are the psychological causes of it:
nature? Nurture? Current circumstance?
Turns out that the research done on that is absolutely mind-blowing.
You can view it as a computing problem, an artificial intelligence problem:
do you need to incorporate
some sort of analog of happiness into a computer brain to make it work properly?
You can view it in sort of geopolitical terms
and say, why is it that a billion people on this planet
are so desperately needy that they have no possibility of happiness,
and whereas almost all the rest of them,
regardless of how much money they have -- whether it's two dollars a day or whatever --
are almost equally happy on average?
Or you can view it as an evolutionary psychology kind of thing:
did our genes invent this as a kind of trick
to get us to behave in certain ways? The ant's brain, parasitized,
to make us behave in certain ways so that our genes would propagate?
Are we the victims of a mass delusion?
And so on, and so on.
you kind of have to branch off in all these different directions,
and there's nowhere that I've discovered -- other than TED --
where you can ask that many questions in that many different directions.
And so, it's the profound thing that Richard talks about:
to understand anything, you just need to understand the little bits;
a little bit about everything that surrounds it.
And so, gradually over these three days,
you start off kind of trying to figure out,
"Why am I listening to all this irrelevant stuff?"
And at the end of the four days,
your brain is humming and you feel energized, alive and excited,
and it's because all these different bits have been put together.
It's the total brain experience, we're going to ...
it's the mental equivalent of the full body massage.
(Laughter)
Every mental organ addressed. It really is.
So, I will. Here's the vision for TED.
Jeff Bezos kindly remarked to me,
"Chris, TED is a really great conference.
You're going to have to fuck up really badly to make it bad."
(Laughter)
So, I gave myself the job title of TED Custodian for a reason,
and I will promise you right here and now
that the core values that make TED special are not going to be interfered with.
Truth, curiosity, diversity, no selling, no corporate bullshit,
no bandwagoning, no platforms.
Just the pursuit of interest, wherever it lies,
across all the disciplines that are represented here.
That's not going to be changed at all.
an incredible line up of speakers for next year.
The time scale on which TED operates is just fantastic
after coming out of a magazine business with monthly deadlines.
There's a year to do this, and already --
I hope to show you a bit later --
there's 25 or so terrific speakers signed up for next year.
And I'm getting fantastic help from the community;
this is just such a great community. And combined, our contacts
reach pretty much everyone who's interesting in the country, if not the planet.
It's true.
of extending the TED experience throughout the year a little bit.
And one key way that we're going to do this is to introduce this book club.
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years,
and that's a gift that I would like to pass on.
So, when you sign up for TED2003, every six weeks you'll get a care package
with a book or two and a reason why they're linked to TED.
They may well be by a TED speaker,
and so we can get the conversation going during the year
and come back next year having had the same intellectual, emotional journey.
I think it will be great.
which is the new owner of TED.
What Sapling's ownership means is that all of the proceeds of TED
will go towards the causes that Sapling stands for.
And more important, I think, the ideas that are exhibited and realized here
are ideas that the foundation can use, because there's fantastic synergy.
Already, just in the last few days,
we've had so many people talking about stuff that they care about,
that they're passionate about, that can make a difference in the world,
and the idea of getting this group of people together --
some of the causes that we believe in,
the money that this conference can raise and the ideas --
I really believe that that combination will, over time, make a difference.
I'm incredibly excited about that.
In fact, I don't think, overall, that I've been as excited by anything ever in my life.
I'm in this for the long run,
and I would be greatly honored and excited
if you'll come on this journey with me.
I grew up in Europe, and World War II caught me
when I was between seven and 10 years old.
And I realized how few of the grown-ups that I knew
were able to withstand the tragedies that the war visited on them --
how few of them could even resemble a normal, contented,
satisfied, happy life once their job, their home, their security
was destroyed by the war.
So I became interested in understanding
what contributed to a life that was worth living.
And I tried, as a child, as a teenager, to read philosophy
and to get involved in art and religion and many other ways
that I could see as a possible answer to that question.
And finally I ended up encountering psychology by chance.
to actually enjoy myself, because the snow had melted and
I didn't have money to go to a movie. But I found that on the --
I read in the newspapers that there was to be a presentation
by someone in a place that I'd seen in the center of Zurich,
and it was about flying saucers [that] he was going to talk.
And I thought, well, since I can't go to the movies,
at least I will go for free to listen to flying saucers.
And the man who talked at that evening lecture was very interesting.
Instead of talking about little green men,
he talked about how the psyche of the Europeans
had been traumatized by the war, and now they're projecting
flying saucers into the sky.
He talked about how the mandalas of ancient Hindu religion
were kind of projected into the sky as an attempt to regain
some sense of order after the chaos of war.
And this seemed very interesting to me.
And I started reading his books after that lecture.
And that was Carl Jung, whose name or work I had no idea about.
and I started trying to understand the roots of happiness.
This is a typical result that many people have presented,
and there are many variations on it.
But this, for instance, shows that about 30 percent of the people
surveyed in the United States since 1956
say that their life is very happy.
And that hasn't changed at all.
Whereas the personal income,
on a scale that has been held constant to accommodate for inflation,
has more than doubled, almost tripled, in that period.
But you find essentially the same results,
namely, that after a certain basic point -- which corresponds more or less
to just a few 1,000 dollars above the minimum poverty level --
increases in material well-being don't seem to affect how happy people are.
In fact, you can find that the lack of basic resources,
material resources, contributes to unhappiness,
but the increase in material resources does not increase happiness.
after finding out these things that actually corresponded
to my own experience, I tried to understand:
where -- in everyday life, in our normal experience --
do we feel really happy?
And to start
those studies about 40 years ago, I began to look at creative people --
first artists and scientists, and so forth -- trying to understand
what made them feel that it was worth essentially spending their life
doing things for which many of them didn't expect either fame or fortune,
but which made their life meaningful and worth doing.
And the interview was 40 pages long.
But this little excerpt is a very good summary
of what he was saying during the interview.
And it describes how he feels when composing is going well.
And he says by describing it as an ecstatic state.
simply to stand to the side of something.
And then it became essentially an analogy for a mental state
where you feel that you are not doing your ordinary everyday routines.
So ecstasy is essentially a stepping into an alternative reality.
And it's interesting, if you think about it, how, when we think about
the civilizations that we look up to as having been pinnacles of human achievement --
whether it's China, Greece, the Hindu civilization,
or the Mayas, or Egyptians -- what we know about them
is really about their ecstasies, not about their everyday life.
We know the temples they built, where people could come
to experience a different reality.
We know about the circuses,
the arenas, the theaters.
These are the remains of civilizations and they are the places that people went
to experience life in a more concentrated, more ordered form.
which is also -- this place, this arena, which is built
like a Greek amphitheatre, is a place for ecstasy also.
We are participating in a reality that is different
from that of the everyday life that we're used to.
But this man doesn't need to go there.
He needs just a piece of paper where he can put down little marks,
and as he does that, he can imagine sounds
that had not existed before in that particular combination.
So once he gets to that point of beginning to create,
like Jennifer did in her improvisation,
a new reality -- that is, a moment of ecstasy --
he enters that different reality.
Now he says also that this is so intense an experience
that it feels almost as if he didn't exist.
And that sounds like a kind of a romantic exaggeration.
But actually, our nervous system is incapable of processing
more than about 110 bits of information per second.
And in order to hear me and understand what I'm saying,
you need to process about 60 bits per second.
That's why you can't hear more than two people.
You can't understand more than two people talking to you.
of creating something new, as this man is,
he doesn't have enough attention left over to monitor
how his body feels, or his problems at home.
He can't feel even that he's hungry or tired.
His body disappears,
his identity disappears from his consciousness,
because he doesn't have enough attention, like none of us do,
to really do well something that requires a lot of concentration,
and at the same time to feel that he exists.
So existence is temporarily suspended.
And he says that his hand seems to be moving by itself.
Now, I could look at my hand for two weeks, and I wouldn't feel
any awe or wonder, because I can't compose. (Laughter)
is that obviously this automatic,
spontaneous process that he's describing can only happen to someone
who is very well trained and who has developed technique.
And it has become a kind of a truism in the study of creativity
that you can't be creating anything with less than 10 years
of technical-knowledge immersion in a particular field.
Whether it's mathematics or music, it takes that long
to be able to begin to change something in a way that it's better
than what was there before.
Now, when that happens,
he says the music just flows out.
And because all of these people I started interviewing --
this was an interview which is over 30 years old --
so many of the people described this as a spontaneous flow
that I called this type of experience the "flow experience."
And it happens in different realms.
This is by a student of mine who interviewed
some of the leading writers and poets in the United States.
And it describes the same effortless, spontaneous feeling
that you get when you enter into this ecstatic state.
This poet describes it as opening a door that floats in the sky --
a very similar description to what Albert Einstein gave
as to how he imagined the forces of relativity,
when he was struggling with trying to understand how it worked.
For instance, this is another student of mine,
Susan Jackson from Australia, who did work
with some of the leading athletes in the world.
And you see here in this description of an Olympic skater,
the same essential description of the phenomenology
of the inner state of the person.
You don't think; it goes automatically,
if you merge yourself with the music, and so forth.
called "Good Business," where I interviewed some of the CEOs
who had been nominated by their peers as being both very successful
and very ethical, very socially responsible.
You see that these people define success
as something that helps others and at the same time
makes you feel happy as you are working at it.
And like all of these successful and responsible CEOs say,
you can't have just one of these things be successful
if you want a meaningful and successful job.
Anita Roddick is another one of these CEOs we interviewed.
She is the founder of Body Shop,
the natural cosmetics king.
It's kind of a passion that comes
from doing the best and having flow while you're working.
who was at that time starting out Sony without any money,
without a product -- they didn't have a product,
they didn't have anything, but they had an idea.
And the idea he had was to establish a place of work where engineers
can feel the joy of technological innovation,
be aware of their mission to society and work to their heart's content.
I couldn't improve on this as a good example
of how flow enters the workplace.
we have, with other colleagues around the world,
done over 8,000 interviews of people -- from Dominican monks,
to blind nuns, to Himalayan climbers, to Navajo shepherds --
who enjoy their work.
And regardless of the culture,
regardless of education or whatever, there are these seven conditions
that seem to be there when a person is in flow.
There's this focus that, once it becomes intense,
leads to a sense of ecstasy, a sense of clarity:
you know exactly what you want to do from one moment to the other;
you get immediate feedback.
You know that what you need to do
is possible to do, even though difficult,
and sense of time disappears, you forget yourself,
you feel part of something larger.
And once the conditions are present,
what you are doing becomes worth doing for its own sake.
And we can measure this very precisely, actually,
because we give people electronic pagers that go off 10 times a day,
and whenever they go off you say what you're doing, how you feel,
where you are, what you're thinking about.
And two things that we measure is the amount of challenge
people experience at that moment and the amount of skill
that they feel they have at that moment.
So for each person we can establish an average,
which is the center of the diagram.
That would be your mean level of challenge and skill,
which will be different from that of anybody else.
But you have a kind of a set point there, which would be in the middle.
we can predict fairly accurately when you will be in flow,
and it will be when your challenges are higher than average
and skills are higher than average.
And you may be doing things very differently from other people,
but for everyone that flow channel, that area there,
will be when you are doing what you really like to do --
play the piano, be with your best friend, perhaps work,
if work is what provides flow for you.
And then the other areas become less and less positive.
Your skills are not quite as high as they should be,
but you can move into flow fairly easily
by just developing a little more skill.
So, arousal is the area where most people learn from,
because that's where they're pushed beyond their comfort zone
and to enter that -- going back to flow --
then they develop higher skills.
Control is also a good place to be,
because there you feel comfortable, but not very excited.
It's not very challenging any more.
And if you want to enter flow from control,
you have to increase the challenges.
So those two are ideal and complementary areas
from which flow is easy to go into.
become progressively less optimal.
Relaxation is fine -- you still feel OK.
Boredom begins to be very aversive
and apathy becomes very negative:
you don't feel that you're doing anything,
you don't use your skills, there's no challenge.
Unfortunately, a lot of people's experience is in apathy.
The largest single contributor to that experience
is watching television; the next one is being in the bathroom, sitting.
Even though sometimes watching television
about seven to eight percent of the time is in flow,
but that's when you choose a program you really want to watch
and you get feedback from it.
is how to put more and more of everyday life in that flow channel.
And that is the kind of challenge that we're trying to understand.
And some of you obviously know how to do that spontaneously
without any advice, but unfortunately a lot of people don't.
And that's what our mandate is, in a way, to do.
It's amazing, when you meet a head of state and you say,
"What is your most precious natural resource?" --
they will not say children at first.
And then when you say children,
they will pretty quickly agree with you.
the Minister of Defense of Colombia,
head of the army and the head of the police,
and we're dropping off 650 laptops
today to children
who have no television, no telephone
and have been in a community
cut off from the rest of the world
for the past 40 years.
is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected
because of the FARC,
the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago
as a political movement and then became a drug movement.
There are one billion children in the world,
and 50 percent of them don't have electricity
at home or at school.
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan --
75 percent of the little girls don't go to school.
And I don't mean that they drop out of school
in the third or fourth grade -- they don't go.
since I talked at TED and showed a prototype,
it's gone from an idea
to a real laptop.
We have half a million laptops today
in the hands of children.
We have about a quarter of a million in transit
to those and other children,
and then there are another quarter of a million more
that are being ordered at this moment.
So, in rough numbers, there are a million laptops.
That's smaller than I predicted --
I predicted three to 10 million --
but is still a very large number.
It's the Minister of Defense with whom we're working,
not the Minister of Education, because it is seen as
a strategic defense issue
in the sense of liberating these zones
that had been completely closed off,
in which the people who had been causing, if you will,
40 years' worth of bombings and kidnappings
and assassinations lived.
the kids have connected laptops.
They've leapfrogged.
The change is absolutely monumental,
because it's not just opening it up,
but it's opening it up to the rest of the world.
So yes, they're building roads, yes, they're putting in telephone,
yes, there will be television.
But the kids six to 12 years old
are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages,
so the children grow up
with access to information,
with a window into the rest of the world.
Before, they were closed off.
it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it
as an engine of economic growth.
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years.
It's not going to happen, you know, in one year,
but it's an important, deeply economic
and cultural change
that happens through children.
Thirty-one countries in total are involved,
and in the case of Uruguay,
half the children already have them,
and by the middle of 2009,
every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop --
a little green laptop.
Some of the results
that go across every single country
include teachers saying
they have never loved teaching so much,
and reading comprehension
measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets.
Probably the most important thing we see
is children teaching parents.
They own the laptops. They take them home.
And so when I met with three children from the schools,
who had traveled all day to come to Bogota,
one of the three children brought her mother.
And the reason she brought her mother
is that this six-year-old child
had been teaching her mother
how to read and write.
Her mother had not gone to primary school.
And this is such an inversion,
and such a wonderful example
of children being the agents of change.
now why laptops?
Laptops are a luxury; it's like giving them iPods. No.
The reason you want laptops
is that the word is education, not laptop.
This is an education project, not a laptop project.
They need to learn learning. And then, just think --
they can have, let's say, 100 books.
In a village, you have 100 laptops,
each with a different set of 100 books,
and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books.
You and I didn't have 10,000 books when we went to primary school.
or in many cases, the teacher has only a fifth-grade education,
so you need a collaborative model of learning,
not just building more schools and training more teachers,
which you have to do anyway.
So we're once again doing "Give One, Get One."
Last year, we ran a "Give One, Get One" program,
and it generated over 100,000 laptops
that we were then able to give free.
And by being a zero-dollar laptop,
we can go to countries that can't afford it at all.
And that's what we did. We went to Haiti,
we went to Rwanda, Afghanistan,
Ethiopia, Mongolia.
Places that are not markets,
seeding it with the principles of
saturation, connectivity, low ages, etc.
And then we can actually roll out large numbers.
think of it as inoculating children
against ignorance.
And think of the laptop as a vaccine.
You don't vaccinate a few children.
You vaccinate all the children in an area.
You know, when Chris first approached me to speak at TED, I said no,
because I felt like I wasn't going to be able
to make that personal connection, you know, that I wanted to.
It's such a large conference.
But he explained to me that he was in a bind,
One: I want to speak as early in the morning as possible.
and you still feel like you were there.
but let it not be a surprise to you,
for you to assure me of safety and honesty,
if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody.
and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund.
in a safe, reliable security company in Dakar, Senegal,
where I was only given temporary asylum.
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal
due to unfavorable economic climate, and so close to my country.
The only assistance I need from you, which I know you would do for me,
two, provide a bank account under your control
to which the funds will be remitted;
three, receive the funds into your account in trust;
take out your commission; and leave the rest of the money
until I arrive, after the transfer is complete.
I only prepared 15.
That's nothing to be ashamed of.
Really cool, we were getting wasted.
And they said that I could just type in "What was I going to say next?"
Am I feeling lucky?
due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge,
I owed them 30,000 dollars.
and complex philosophy, which I won't get into here,
because it's a little too deep for all of you, but --
Four years later, I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day
to kind of get to know different cultures, you know?
It's like a microscope to the rest of the world.
How is his presentation so smooth?"
I guess Chris has to take some credit here, because in years past,
I guess there's been some sort of subpar speakers at TED.
and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience.
And I've got to say that, you know, it's really, really great to be here.
but the video game market,
I figured it would be popular with the young kids.
"Buddhist," of course, looks very, very similar to "Atheist."
you can play this for a long time.
that we should really bring something new to TED,
It's the third in the series.
And in fact, making things using technology --
It's the process of creation that keeps me
sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life,
and it's that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project --
The watch is particularly incredible.
And eventually, it just makes them stop playing with it,
In other words, it's a helping tool.
So the idea is that you can really,
you know, partake in this process,
but watch something really crappy look beautiful.
None of the haikus were written by the same person.
at a different time.
It's an amazing way, and I'll tell you,
if you come home, and your spouse, or whoever it is,
that allow people to get together, doing fun things.
Lotte Reiniger, an amazing shadow puppeteer in the 20s,
and I just want to show one last thing to you.
Oh, this is how you make puppets.
In 1962, with Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring,"
I think for people like me in the world of the making of things,
the canary in the mine wasn't singing.
And so the question that we might not have birds
became kind of fundamental to those of us wandering around
looking for the meadowlarks that seemed to have all disappeared.
And the question was, were the birds singing?
Now, I'm not a scientist, that'll be really clear.
But, you know, we've just come from this discussion of what a bird might be.
What is a bird?
Well, in my world, this is a rubber duck.
It comes in California with a warning --
"This product contains chemicals known by the State of California
to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."
This is a bird.
What kind of culture would produce a product of this kind
and then label it and sell it to children?
I think we have a design problem.
but it also has to occur within a world,
and we have to understand that world in order to
imbue our designs with inherent intelligence,
and so as we look back at the basic state of affairs
in which we design, we, in a way, need to go to the primordial condition
to understand the operating system and the frame conditions of a planet,
and I think the exciting part of that is the good news that's there,
because the news is the news of abundance,
and not the news of limits,
and I think as our culture tortures itself now
with tyrannies and concerns over limits and fear,
we can add this other dimension of abundance that is coherent,
That was a nice thing to get.
Henry James would be proud.
This is -- I put it down at the bottom,
but that was extemporaneous, obviously.
because how could you dominate something you had killed?
And stewardship's implicit in dominion,
Now, as guardians -- let's say the state, for example,
which reserves the right to kill, the right to be duplicitous and so on --
the question we're asking the guardian at this point is
are we meant, how are we meant,
to secure local societies, create world peace
and save the environment?
But I don't know that that's the common debate.
essentially creative, highly effective and efficient,
and fundamentally honest, because we can't exchange
value for very long if we don't trust each other.
And so we start our designs with that question.
Because what we realize today is that modern culture
appears to have adopted a strategy of tragedy.
If we come here and say, "Well, I didn't intend
Because it's the thing that's happening because we have no other plan.
If the end game is global warming, they're doing great.
If the end game is mercury toxification of our children
downwind of coal fire plants as they scuttled the Clean Air Act,
then I see that our education programs should be explicitly defined as,
are ready to move to Ohio and Pennsylvania with their families?
So if you don't have an endgame of something delightful,
So perhaps we could develop a strategy of change,
which requires humility. And in my business as an architect,
it's unfortunate the word "humility" and the word "architect"
have not appeared in the same paragraph since "The Fountainhead."
So if anybody here has trouble with the concept of design humility,
reflect on this -- it took us 5,000 years
to put wheels on our luggage.
So, as Kevin Kelly pointed out, there is no endgame.
There is an infinite game, and we're playing in that infinite game.
And so we call it "cradle to cradle,"
and our goal is very simple.
economically, equitably, ecologically and elegantly enjoyed, period.
Which part of this don't you like?
So we realized we want full diversity,
even though it can be difficult to remember what De Gaulle said
when asked what it was like to be President of France.
He said, "What do you think it's like trying to run a country with 400 kinds of cheese?"
But at the same time, we realize that our products are not safe and healthy.
and we analyzed chemicals down to the parts per million.
This is a baby blanket by Pendleton that will give your child nutrition

We can ask ourselves, what is justice,
and is justice blind, or is justice blindness?
And at what point did that uniform turn from white to black?
Water has been declared a human right by the United Nations.
Air quality is an obvious thing to anyone who breathes.
Is there anybody here who doesn't breathe?
Clean soil is a critical problem -- the nitrification, the dead zones

A fundamental issue that's not being addressed.
here in the Great Plains, and so that hegemony is leaving.
And if we remember Sheikh Yamani when he formed OPEC,
they asked him, "When will we see the end of the age of oil?"
I don't know if you remember his answer, but it was,
"The Stone Age didn't end because we ran out of stones."
We see that companies acting ethically in this world
are outperforming those that don't.
We see the flows of materials in a rather terrifying prospect.
This is a hospital monitor from Los Angeles, sent to China.
This woman will expose herself to toxic phosphorous,
release four pounds of toxic lead into her childrens' environment,
which is from copper.
Here's Dr. Venkataswamy in India, who's figured out

He has given eyesight to two million people for free.
We see in our material flows that car steels don't become car steel again
because of the contaminants of the coatings --
bismuth, antimony, copper and so on.

Now if I was a bird, the building on my left is a liability.
The building on my right, which is our corporate campus for The Gap
with an ancient meadow, is an asset -- its nesting grounds.
with six million people in 40 square miles.
During the dry season, we had four hours of water every fourth day.
And the relationship to landscape was that of farmers who have been
without understanding nutrient flow.
My childhood summers were in the Puget Sound of Washington,
among the first growth and big growth.
My grandfather had been a lumberjack in the Olympics,
I went to Yale for graduate school,
studied in a building of this style by Le Corbusier,
affectionately known in our business as Brutalism.
If we look at the world of architecture,
we see with Mies' 1928 tower for Berlin,
the question might be, "Well, where's the sun?"
And this might have worked in Berlin, but we built it in Houston,
and the windows are all closed. And with most products
appearing not to have been designed for indoor use,
this is actually a vertical gas chamber.
and I was designing the first solar-heated house in Ireland
as a student, which I then built --
which would give you a sense of my ambition.
And Richard Meier, who was one of my teachers,
kept coming over to my desk to give me criticism,
and he would say, "Bill, you've got to understand- --
solar energy has nothing to do with architecture."
I guess he didn't read Vitruvius.
In 1984, we did the first so-called "green office" in America
for Environmental Defense.
We started asking manufacturers what were in their materials.
They said, "They're proprietary, they're legal, go away."
and this happens, and we realize that "away" went away.
Remember we used to throw things away, and we'd point to away?
And yet, NOAA has now shown us, for example --
you see that little blue thing above Hawaii?
That's the Pacific Gyre.
When asked, they said, "It's kind of like a giant toilet that doesn't flush."
Perhaps that's away.
So we're looking for the design rules of this --
in the book, "Cradle to Cradle."
The book itself is a polymer. It is not a tree.
That's the name of the first chapter -- "This Book is Not a Tree."
Because in poetics, as Margaret Atwood pointed out,
"we write our history on the skin of fish
is technical nutrition, and to use something
as elegant as a tree -- imagine this design assignment:
Design something that makes oxygen, sequesters carbon,
fixes nitrogen, distills water, accrues solar energy as fuel,
makes complex sugars and food, creates microclimates,
changes colors with the seasons and self-replicates.
Well, why don't we knock that down and write on it?
as most people -- you know, can I afford it?
Does it work? Do I like it?
I'm sure most of you've used it.
It means the way Olympic athletes train with each other.
They get fit together, and then they compete.
The Williams sisters compete -- one wins Wimbledon.
So we've been looking at the idea of competition
as a way of cooperating in order to get fit together.
And the Chinese government has now --
I work with the Chinese government now --
has taken this up.
We're also looking at survival of the fittest,
not in just competition terms in our modern context
of destroy the other or beat them to the ground,
but really to fit together and build niches
and have growth that is good.
But if we look at asphalt as our growth,
and all of a sudden, you get this biology.
And we have plenty of energy, so we'll solve that problem,
but the biology problem's tricky, because as we put through
all these toxic materials that we disgorge,
we will never be able to recover that.
And as Francis Crick pointed out, nine years
after discovering DNA with Mr. Watson,
that life itself has to have growth as a precondition --
it has to have free energy, sunlight
and it needs to be an open system of chemicals.
So we're asking for human artifice to become a living thing,
So instead of just growing destruction,
we want to grow the things that we might enjoy,
and someday the FDA will allow us to make French cheese.
and I worked with a German chemist, Michael Braungart,
and we've identified the two fundamental metabolisms.
The biological one I'm sure you understand,
but also the technical one, where we take materials
and put them into closed cycles.
We call them biological nutrition and technical nutrition.
Technical nutrition will be in an order of magnitude of biological nutrition.
Biological nutrition can supply about 500 million humans,
So we need materials in closed cycles,
but we need to analyze them down to the parts per million
for cancer, birth defects, mutagenic effects,
disruption of our immune systems, biodegradation, persistence,
heavy metal content, knowledge of how we're making them
and their production and so on.
in the textile industry.
Using those intellectual filters, we eliminated [7,962.]
We were left with 38 chemicals.
We have since databased the 4000 most commonly used chemicals
in human manufacturing, and we're releasing this database into the public in six weeks.
these same messages all the way through their supply chains,
because when we asked most companies we work with -- about a trillion dollars
-- and say, "Where does your stuff come from?" They say, "Suppliers."
"And where does it go?"
"Customers."

There is no finish line.
The idea here of the car is that some of the materials
go back to the industry forever, some of the materials go back to soil --
it's all solar-powered.
It's the revitalization of the River Rouge in Dearborn.
This is obviously a color photograph.
We saved Ford 35 million dollars doing it this way, day one,
which is the equivalent of the Ford Taurus
at a four percent margin of an order for 900 million dollars worth of cars.
Here it is. It's the world's largest green roof, 10 and a half acres.
This is the roof, saving money,

And we now have 350-pound auto workers

We're developing now protocols for cities --
that's the home of technical nutrients.
The country -- the home of biological. And putting them together.
we're designing for the Chinese government.
We're doing 12 cities for China right now,
based on cradle to cradle as templates.
Our assignment is to develop protocols for the housing
for 400 million people in 12 years.
We did a mass energy balance -- if they use brick,
they will lose all their soil and burn all their coal.
They'll have cities with no energy and no food.
We signed a Memorandum of Understanding --
here's Madam Deng Nan, Deng Xiaoping's daughter --
for China to adopt cradle to cradle.
Because if they toxify themselves, being the lowest-cost producer,
send it to the lowest-cost distribution -- Wal-Mart --
and then we send them all our money, what we'll discover is that
we have what, effectively, when I was a student,
was called mutually assured destruction.
We don't normally do green fields, but this one is about to be built,
so they brought us in to intercede.
This is their plan.
It's a rubber stamp grid that they laid right on that landscape.
And they brought us in and said, "What would you do?"
This is what they would end up with, which is another color photograph.
So this is the existing site, so this is what it looks like now,
and here's our proposal.
is we studied the hydrology very carefully.
We studied the biota, the ancient biota,
the current farming and the protocols.
in every single apartment at some point during the day.
We then take the parks and lay them out as ecological infrastructure.
so the people all have centers and places to be.
The transportation is all very simple,
everybody's within a five-minute walk of mobility.
We have a 24-hour street, so that there's always a place that's alive.
The waste systems all connect.
If you flush a toilet, your feces will go to the sewage treatment plants,
which are sold as assets, not liabilities.
Because who wants the fertilizer factory that makes natural gas?
The waters are all taken in to construct the wetlands for habitat restorations.
And then it makes natural gas, which then goes back into the city
to power the fuel for the cooking for the city.
So this is -- these are fertilizer gas plants.
And then the compost is all taken back
and all the industrial zones with their light roofs powers the city.
We've lifted the earth up onto the roofs.
The farmers have little bridges to get from one roof to the next.
We inhabit the city with work/live space on all the ground floors.
And so this is the existing city, and this is the new city.
I just want to say, over the last few years I've been --

TR: Now it's a little hard to hear the whole message, so I wanted to --
we've talked a lot about global warming,
but, you know, as Jill said, it sounds kind of nice --
So I've tried to figure out a good design process
to come up with a new term to replace "global warming."
From Dutch to [Korean], into "Hordahordaneecheewa."

It's getting just a little bit too big. It's bursting at the seams here a little bit.
So we tried to come up with a program --

about five percent for restrooms.

I work with a species called "Bonobo."
And I'm happy most of the time,
because I think this is the happiest species on the planet.
It's kind of a well-kept secret.
This species lives only in the Congo.
And they're not in too many zoos, because of their sexual behavior.
Their sexual behavior is too human-like
for most of us to be comfortable with.
egalitarian society and they're a very empathetic society.
And sexual behavior is not confined to one aspect of their life
that they sort of set aside.
It permeates their entire life.
And it's used for communication.
And it's used for conflict resolution.
And I think perhaps somewhere in our history we sort of,
divided our lives up into lots of parts.
We divided our world up with lots of categories.
And so everything sort of has a place that it has to fit.
But I don't think that we were that way initially.
and that there's something very, very special about man.
Maybe it's his ability to have causal thought.
Maybe it's something special in his brain
that allows him to have language.
Maybe it's something special in his brain
that allows him to make tools or to have mathematics.
Well, I don't know. There were Tasmanians who were discovered
around the 1600s and they had no fire.
They had no stone tools.
To our knowledge they had no music.
So when you compare them to the Bonobo,
the Bonobo is a little hairier.
He doesn't stand quite as upright.
But there are a lot of similarities.
And I think that as we look at culture,
we kind of come to understand
how we got to where we are.
And I don't really think it's in our biology;
I think we've attributed it to our biology,
but I don't really think it's there.
to a species called the Bonobo.
This is Kanzi.
He's a Bonobo.
Right now, he's in a forest in Georgia.
His mother originally came from a forest in Africa.
And she came to us when she was just at puberty,
about six or seven years of age.
and a chimpanzee on your left.
Clearly, the chimpanzee has a little bit harder time of walking.
The Bonobo, although shorter than us and their arms still longer,
is more upright, just as we are.
This shows the Bonobo compared to an australopithecine like Lucy.
As you can see, there's not a lot of difference
between the way a Bonobo walks
and the way an early australopithecine would have walked.
As they turn toward us you'll see
that the pelvic area of early australopithecines is a little flatter
and doesn't have to rotate quite so much from side to side.
So the -- the bipedal gait is a little easier.
And now we see all four.
grow densely in the area.
It was a Japanese scientist
who first undertook serious field studies of the Bonobo,
almost three decades ago.
Bonobos are built slightly smaller than the chimpanzee.
Slim-bodied, Bonobos are by nature very gentle creatures.
Long and careful studies have reported many new findings on them.
One discovery was that wild Bonobos often walk bidpedally.
What's more, they are able to walk upright for long distances.
Susan Savage-Rumbaugh (video): Let's go say hello to Austin first and then go to the A frame.
None of the things you will see in this particular video are trained.

In the wild, the parent Bonobo is known to groom its offspring.
Here Panbanisha uses scissors, instead of her hands,
to groom Nyota.
Very impressive.
Subtle maneuvering of the hands is required
to perform delicate tasks like this.
Nyota tries to imitate Panbanisha by using the scissors himself.
Realizing that Nyota might get hurt,
Panbanisha, like any human mother,
carefully tugs to get the scissors back.
just as our ancestors may have made them,
two-and-a-half million years ago --
by holding the rocks in both hands, to strike one against the other.
He has learned that by using both hands
and aiming his glancing blows,
he can make much larger, sharper flakes.
Kanzi chooses a flake he thinks is sharp enough.
The tough hide is difficult to cut, even with a knife.
The rock that Kanzi is using is extremely hard
and ideal for stone tool making, but difficult to handle,
requiring great skill.
Kanzi's rock is from Gona, Ethiopia
and is identical to that used by our African ancestors
two-and-a-half million years ago.
These are the rocks Kanzi used
and these are the flakes he made.
The flat sharp edges are like knife blades.
Compare them to the tools our ancestors used;
they bear a striking resemblance to Kanzi's.

What is she writing?
"A frame" represents a hut in the woods.
Compare the chalk writing with the lexigram on the keyboard.
Panbanisha began writing the lexigrams on the forest floor.
SS (video): Very nice. Beautiful, Panbanisha.
until we stood back and looked at it and rotated it.
The curved line is very similar to the lexigram.
The next symbol Panbanisha writes represents "collar."
It indicates the collar that Panbanisha must wear when she goes out.
but one can see Panbanisha is trying to produce a curved line
and several straight lines.
Researchers began to record what Panbanisha said,
by writing lexigrams on the floor with chalk.
Panbanisha watched.
Soon she began to write as well.
The Bonobo's abilities have stunned scientists around the world.
How did they develop?
for permitting Bonobos to acquire language is not to teach them.
It's simply to use language around them,
because the driving force in language acquisition
is to understand what others, that are important to you, are saying to you.
Once you have that capacity,
the ability to produce language
comes rather naturally and rather freely.
So we want to create an environment in which Bonobos,
like all of the individuals with whom they are interacting --
we want to create an environment in which they have fun,
and an environment in which the others
are meaningful individuals for them.
Narrator: This environment brings out unexpected potential
in Kanzi and Panbanisha.
until Nyota, now one year old, steals it.
Then he peers eagerly into his mother's mouth.
Is he looking for where the sound came from?
Dr. Sue thinks it's important to allow such curiosity to flourish.
This time Panbanisha is playing the electric piano.
She wasn't forced to learn the piano;
she saw a researcher play the instrument and took an interest.
Do that real fast part that you did. Yeah, that part.
using both hands he enthusiastically accompanies Dr. Sue's singing.
Kanzi and Panbanisha
are stimulated by this fun-filled environment,
which promotes the emergence of these cultural capabilities.
Take the cherries too.
Now watch out, stay away from them now.
Now you can chase them again. Time to chase them.
Now you have to stay away. Get away.
Run away. Run.
Now we can chase them again. Go get them.
Oh no!
Good Kanzi. Very good. Thank you so much.
We're learning how to become like them.
We're learning how to communicate with them,
in really high-pitched tones.
We're learning that they probably have a language in the wild.
And they're learning to become like us.
Because we believe that it's not biology; it's culture.
So we're sharing tools and technology and language
with another species.
About 15 years ago, I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong.
And at the time I was very superstitious.
So, upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport
that's Kai Tak, when it was smack in the middle of the city --
I thought, "If I see something good, I'm going to have a great time here in
my two weeks. And if I see something negative, I'm going to be miserable, indeed."
and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard.
(Laughter)
And I actually went to see some of the design companies
in Hong Kong in my stay there.
And it turned out that --
I just went to see, you know, what they are doing in Hong Kong.
And I flew back to Austria, packed my bags,
and, another week later, I was again on my way to Hong Kong
still superstitions and thinking, "Well, if that 'Winner' billboard is still up,
I'm going to have a good time working here.
(Laughter)
But if it's gone, it's going to be really miserable and stressful."
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up
but they had put this one right next to it.
(Laughter)
On the other hand, it also taught me where superstition gets me
because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong.
(Laughter)
of, you know, I think what the conference brochure refers to
as "moments that take your breath away."
And since I'm a big list maker, I actually listed them all.
(Laughter)
Now, you don't have to go through the trouble of reading them
and I won't read them for you.
I know that it's incredibly boring to hear about other people's happinesses.
(Laughter)
and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design.
And, very surprisingly, over half of them had, actually, something to do with design.
There's one from a consumer's point of view --
where I was happy while experiencing design.
And I'll just give you one example. I had gotten my first Walkman.
This is 1983.
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle
that he was willing to borrow to me freely.
And The Police's "Synchronicity"
cassette had just been released
and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz.
So you could drive up into the mountains
freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman.
(Laughter)
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness.
You know, of course, they are related to this combination of
at least two of them being, you know, design objects.
And, you know, there's a scale of happiness when you talk about in design
but the motorcycle incident would definitely be, you know,
situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss.
if you're happy while actually doing it.
And one way to see how happy designers are when they're designing could be to
look at the authors' photos on the back of their monographs?
(Laughter)
So, according to this, the Australians and the Japanese
as well as the Mexicans
are very happy.
(Laughter)
While, somewhat, the Spaniards ...
and, I think, particularly, the Swiss
(Laughter),
don't seem to be doing all that well.

in a skyscraper, up on the 56th floor.
And their inaugural exhibit was called "Happiness."
And I went, very eagerly, to see it, because --
well, also, with an eye on this conference.
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas.
Under "Arcadia," they showed things like this, from the Edo period --
a hundred ways to write "happiness" in different forms.
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that, of course, later on
was, you know, made into the label for The Beatles.
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction.
This is a blue field -- it's actually an Yves Klein painting.
And the theory was that if you abstract an image, you really, you know
open as much room for the un-representable --
and, therefore, you know, are able to involve the viewer more.
also from the Edo period -- ink on silk.
And, lastly, under "Harmony," they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet.
maybe with the exception of the mandala
most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness
and not about happiness.
And I felt a little bit cheated, because the visualization --
that's a really easy thing to do.
And, you know, my studio -- we've done it all the time.
This is, you know, a book.
A happy dog -- and you take it out, it's an aggressive dog.
It's a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne.
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face.
You know, that's not a big deal to accomplish.
or within the movie industry, "happy" has gotten such a bad reputation that
if you actually want to do something with the subject
and still appear authentic, you almost would have to, you know,
do it from a cynical point of view.
This is, you know, the movie poster.
Or we, a couple of weeks ago, designed a box set for The Talking Heads
where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has, very much, a dark side to it.
and I'm going to just show you three that actually did this for me.
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York, who calls himself "True."
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be
familiar with these signs?
True printed his own version of these signs.
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends.
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version.
(Laughter)
So this is one.
(Laughter)
So you're
(Laughter)
you're really bored in the subway, and you kind of stare at something.
And it takes you a while until it actually --
you realize that this says something different than what it normally says.
(Laughter)
I mean, that's, at least, how it made me happy.
(Laughter)
He didn't want any of his friends to be arrested,
so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card.
(Laughter)
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody --
sort of like pretending that it's an art project
financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority.
(Laughter)
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that's basically a square room
by James Turrell, that has a retractable ceiling.
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day.
You don't see the horizon.
You're just in there, watching the incredible, subtle changes of color in the sky.
And the room is truly something to be seen.
People's demeanor changes when they go in there.
And, for sure, I haven't looked at the sky in the same way
after spending an hour in there.
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz' "Cloud"
a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy, as well.
But my last project is, again, from a young designer in New York.
He's from Korea originally.
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles --
empty speech bubbles stickers, large ones and small ones.
And he goes around New York and just puts them, empty as they are, on posters.
(Laughter)
And other people go and fill them in.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
I think that was --
the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good.
This is on a musician poster, that says:
"I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units
and that, as a result, my recoupable advance
from my label will be taken from me,
after which, my contract will be cancelled,
and I'll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street."
(Laughter)
Jee gets to have his project;
the public gets a sweeter environment;
and different public gets a place to express itself;
and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads.
(Laughter)
You know, can I do more of the things that I like doing in design
and less of the ones that I don't like to be doing?
Which brought me back to my list making --
you know, just to see what I actually like about my job.
Then: working concentrated, without being frazzled.
Or, as Nancy said before, like really immerse oneself into it.
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing --
or try not get stuck behind the computer all day.
This is, you know, related to it: getting out of the studio.
Then, of course, trying to, you know, work on things
where the content is actually important for me.
And being able to enjoy the end results.
all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far.
And, just about at that time, an Austrian magazine called and asked
if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads
that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine?
And the whole thing just fell together.
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned --
in this case, "Everything I do always comes back to me" --
and we made these spreads right out of this.
So it was: "Everything
I do
always
comes
back
to me."
(Laughter)
French company asked us to design five billboards for them.
Again, we could supply the content for it.
So I just picked another one.
And this was two weeks ago.
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me, and myself --
and photographed this one.
So it's: "Trying
to look
good
limits
my life."
This is, again, for a magazine, dividing pages.
This is: "Having" --
this is the same thing;
it's just, you know, photographed from the side.
This is from the front.
Then it's: "guts."
Again, it's the same thing -- "guts" is just the same room, reworked.
Then it's: "always
works out."
Then it's "for," with the light on.
(Laughter)
And it's "me."
(Applause)
If you'd like to learn how to play the lobster, we have some here.
And that's not a joke, we really do.
So come up afterwards and I'll show you how to play a lobster.
a few years ago because they make sound.
This is a recording I made of a mantis shrimp
that's found off the coast of California.
And while that's an absolutely fascinating sound,
it actually turns out to be a very difficult project.
And while I was struggling to figure out how and why mantis shrimp,
or stomatopods, make sound, I started to think about their appendages.
And mantis shrimp are called "mantis shrimp" after the praying mantises,
which also have a fast feeding appendage. And I started to think,
well, maybe it will be interesting, while listening to their sounds,
to figure out how these animals generate very fast feeding strikes.
And so today I'll talk about the extreme stomatopod strike,
work that I've done in collaboration with Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell.
there are spearers and smashers.
And this is a spearing mantis shrimp, or stomatopod.
And he lives in the sand, and he catches things that go by overhead.
So, a quick strike like that. And if we slow it down a bit,
this is the mantis shrimp -- the same species --
recorded at 1,000 frames a second,
played back at 15 frames per second.
And you can see it's just a really spectacular extension of the limbs,
exploding upward to actually just catch
a dead piece of shrimp that I had offered it.
and these guys open up snails for a living.
And so this guy gets the snail all set up and gives it a good whack.
He wiggles it in place, tugs it with his nose, and smash.
And a few smashes later, the snail is broken open, and he's got a good dinner.
So, the smasher raptorial appendage can stab with a point at the end,
or it can smash with the heel.
And today I'll talk about the smashing type of strike.
well, how fast does this limb move?
Because it's moving pretty darn fast on that video.
And I immediately came upon a problem.
Every single high-speed video system in the biology department
at Berkeley wasn't fast enough to catch this movement.
looking for a story to do about new technologies in biology.
And so we struck up a deal.
I said, "Well, if you guys rent the high-speed video system
that could capture these movements,
you guys can film us collecting the data."
And believe it or not, they went for it. (Laughter)
So we got this incredible video system. It's very new technology --
it just came out about a year ago --
that allows you to film at extremely high speeds in low light.
and there's that raptorial appendage, and there's the heel.
And that thing's going to swing around and smash the snail.
And the snail's wired to a stick,
so he's a little bit easier to set up the shot. And -- yeah.
and I'm playing it back at 15. And so this is slowed down 333 times.
And as you'll notice, it's still pretty gosh darn fast
slowed down 333 times. It's an incredibly powerful movement.
The whole limb extends out. The body flexes backwards --
just a spectacular movement.
So what we calculated was that the limbs were moving
at the peak speed ranging from 10 meters per second
all the way up to 23 meters per second.
And for those of you who prefer miles per hour,
that's over 45 miles per hour in water. And this is really darn fast.
In fact, it's so fast we were able to add a new point
on the extreme animal movement spectrum.
And mantis shrimp are officially the fastest measured feeding strike
So, you might be wondering, well, how do they do it?
And actually, this work was done in the 1960s
by a famous biologist named Malcolm Burrows.
And what he showed in mantis shrimp is that they use
what's called a "catch mechanism," or "click mechanism."
And what this basically consists of is a large muscle
that takes a good long time to contract,
and a latch that prevents anything from moving.
So the muscle contracts, and nothing happens.
And once the muscle's contracted completely, everything's stored up --
the latch flies upward, and you've got the movement.
And that's basically what's called a "power amplification system."
It takes a long time for the muscle to contract,
and a very short time for the limb to fly out.
And so I thought that this was sort of the end of the story.
This was how mantis shrimps make these very fast strikes.
And if any of you ever have a chance,
backstage of the National Museum of Natural History
is one of the world's best collections of preserved mantis shrimp. And what --
whether it's a spearer or a smasher,
is a beautiful saddle-shaped structure
right on the top surface of the limb. And you can see it right here.
It just looks like a saddle you'd put on a horse.
It's a very beautiful structure.
And it's surrounded by membranous areas. And those membranous areas
suggested to me that maybe this is some kind of dynamically flexible structure.
And this really sort of had me scratching my head for a while.
And then we did a series of calculations, and what we were able to show
is that these mantis shrimp have to have a spring.
There needs to be some kind of spring-loaded mechanism
So we thought, OK, this must be a spring --
the saddle could very well be a spring.
And I'll just do that one more time.
And then if you take a look at the video --
it's a little bit hard to see -- it's outlined in yellow.
The saddle is outlined in yellow. You can actually see it
extending over the course of the strike, and actually hyperextending.
So, we've had very solid evidence showing
that that saddle-shaped structure actually compresses and extends,
and does, in fact, function as a spring.
or an "anticlastic surface."
It has curves in two directions,
one curve upward and opposite transverse curve down the other,
so any kind of perturbation spreads the forces
over the surface of this type of shape.
So it's very well known to engineers, not as well known to biologists.
It's also known to quite a few people who make jewelry,
because it requires very little material
to build this type of surface, and it's very strong.
So if you're going to build a thin gold structure,
it's very nice to have it in a shape that's strong.
is Eduardo Catalano, who popularized this structure.
And what's shown here is a saddle-shaped roof that he built
that's 87 and a half feet spanwise.
It's two and a half inches thick, and supported at two points.
And one of the reasons why he designed roofs this way is because it's --
he found it fascinating that you could build such a strong structure
that's made of so few materials and can be supported by so few points.
And all of these are the same principles that apply
to the saddle-shaped spring in stomatopods.
In biological systems it's important not to have a whole lot
of extra material requirements for building it.
So, very interesting parallels between the biological
and the engineering worlds. And interestingly, this turns out --
the stomatopod saddle turns out to be the first
described biological hyperbolic paraboloid spring.
That's a bit long, but it is sort of interesting.
does a mantis shrimp produce if they're able to break open snails?
And so I wired up what's called a load cell.
A load cell measures forces, and this is actually
a piezoelectronic load cell that has a little crystal in it.
And when this crystal is squeezed, the electrical properties change
was actually put a little shrimp paste on the front of the load cell,
and they'd smash away at it.
And so this is just a regular video of the animal
just smashing the heck out of this load cell.
And we were able to get some force measurements out.
And again, we were in for a surprise.
no animal could produce more than 100 pounds at this size of an animal.
And what do you know? They immediately overloaded the load cell.
So these are actually some old data
where I had to find the smallest animals in the lab,
I have to do a little bit more background reading,
but I think this will be the largest amount of force produced
by an animal of a given -- per body mass. So, really incredible forces.
And again, that brings us back to the importance of that spring
But that was not the end of the story.
And I got all these force measurements,
and then I went and looked at the force output of the system.
And this is just very simple -- time is on the X-axis
and the force is on the Y-axis. And you can see two peaks.
The first peak, obviously, is the limb hitting the load cell.
and I didn't know what that was.
So now, you'd expect a second peak for other reasons,
but not half a millisecond later.
Again, going back to those high-speed videos,
there's a pretty good hint of what might be going on.
and it's going to swing around and hit the load cell.
And what I'd like you to do in this shot is keep your eye on this,
at the end of that yellow arrow is a vapor bubble.
And what that is, is cavitation.
And cavitation is an extremely potent fluid dynamic phenomenon
which occurs when you have areas of water
moving at extremely different speeds.
And when this happens, it can cause areas of very low pressure,
which results in the water literally vaporizing.
And when that vapor bubble collapses, it emits sound, light and heat,
and it's a very destructive process.
And so here it is in the stomatopod. And again, this is a situation
where engineers are very familiar with this phenomenon,
because it destroys boat propellers.
People have been struggling for years to try and design
a very fast rotating boat propeller that doesn't cavitate
and literally wear away the metal and put holes in it,
just like these pictures show.
I'm going to show you the mantis shrimp approaching the snail.
This is taken at 20,000 frames per second, and I have to give
full credit to the BBC cameraman, Tim Green, for setting this shot up,
because I could never have done this in a million years --
one of the benefits of working with professional cameramen.
You can see it coming in, and an incredible flash of light,
and all this cavitation spreading over the surface of the snail.
So really, just an amazing image,
slowed down extremely, to extremely slow speeds.
And again, we can see it in slightly different form there,
with the bubble forming and collapsing between those two surfaces.
In fact, you might have even seen some cavitation going up the edge of the limb.
what I think was going on is: that first impact is actually
the limb hitting the load cell, and the second impact is actually
the collapse of the cavitation bubble.
And these animals may very well be making use of
not only the force and the energy stored with that specialized spring,
but the extremes of the fluid dynamics. And they might actually be
making use of fluid dynamics as a second force for breaking the snail.
So, really fascinating double whammy, so to speak, from these animals.
so I figured I'd answer it now -- is, well, what happens to the animal?
Because obviously, if it's breaking snails,
the poor limb must be disintegrating. And indeed it does.
That's the smashing part of the heel on both these images,
and it gets worn away. In fact, I've seen them wear away
their heel all the way to the flesh.
But one of the convenient things about being an arthropod
is that you have to molt. And every three months or so
these animals molt, and they build a new limb and it's no problem.
Very, very convenient solution to that particular problem.
has actually been well known to biologists for a long time,
not as a spring but as a visual signal.
And there's actually a spectacular colored dot
in the center of the saddles of many species of stomatopods.
And this is quite interesting, to find evolutionary origins
of visual signals on what's really, in all species, their spring.
And I think one explanation for this could be
going back to the molting phenomenon.
unable to strike -- their bodies become very soft.
And they're literally unable to strike or they will self-destruct.
when they can't strike, they become really obnoxious and awful,
and they strike everything in sight; it doesn't matter who or what.
And the second they get into that time point when they can't strike any more,
they just signal. They wave their legs around.
And it's one of the classic examples in animal behavior of bluffing.
It's a well-established fact of these animals
that they actually bluff. They can't actually strike, but they pretend to.
And so I'm very curious about whether those colored dots
in the center of the saddles are conveying some kind of information
about their ability to strike, or their strike force,
and something about the time period in the molting cycle.
So sort of an interesting strange fact to find a visual structure
right in the middle of their spring.
Wyatt Korff and Roy Caldwell, who worked closely with me on this.
And also the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science,
Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question
I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.
We spoke to you last several years ago.
And before I get started today,
since many of you are wondering,
I just wanted to get it out of the way.
The answer is boxers.
Now I hope all of you feel better.
But this is what helped me see it.
This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.
Here it's slightly logged.
But here you can see around the world
how people are using Google.
And every one of those rising dots
represents probably about 20, 30 searches,
or something like that.
And they're labeled by color right now, by language.
and they're all coming up red.
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.
You can see that Japan is busy at night,
right there.
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.
There's a lot of activity in China.
There's a lot of activity in India.
There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.
And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,
is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.
hopefully I won't shake the world too much.
But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.
Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.
And this is something that we should really work on,
which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,
basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,
which come in at thousands per second,
are available everywhere there is power.
And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.
And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --
we from time to time will see a query rising up.
And if we had it plotted correctly,
I think the International Space Station would have it, too.
some of the challenge that we have here,
is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --
there we go.
This is how we have to move the bits around
to actually get the people the answers to their questions.
You can see that there's a lot of data running around.
It has to go all over the world: through fibers,
through satellites, through all kinds of connections.
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies
as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.
But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired
than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,
going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.
what one second of this activity would look like.
And if we can switch to slides --
all right, here we go.
So this is slowed down.
This is what one second looks like.
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,
is just making sure that we can keep up
with this kind of traffic load.
Now, each one of those queries
has an interesting life and tale of its own.
I mean, it could be somebody's health,
it could be somebody's career, something important to them.
And it could potentially be something
as important as tomato sauce,
or in this case, ketchup.
I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.
You can see that it got started right here.
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.
as it did in Spain.
And then from Spain, it went to Italy,
and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.
And so I guess the U.S. finally,
finally started to like it, too.
And I just wanted to play it for you.
hopefully that search will work.
As a part of --
you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company
is to have more searches.
And what that means is we want to have
more people who are healthy and educated.
More animals, if they start doing searches as well.
But partly, we want to make the world a better place,
and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,
and we're in the process of setting that up.
that now serves over 150 different charities around the world,
and these are some of the charities that are on there.
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.
In fact, many of the organizations that are here --
the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --
and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit
so they can let organizations know.
we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village
of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,
and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been
many, many stories that have come in,
because we do have hundreds of charities in there,
and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.
Now does anybody know who this is?
A-ha!
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?
Do we have any?
Okay, not very many people know about it.
I'll explain it in a second.
This is one of our engineers.
We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.
That's how we churn those products out.
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.
I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,
when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.
So this is what he built.
We just released it in a test phase last month,
and it's been taking off.
You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.
And these are all of his friends.
So this is how -- we just deployed it --
we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,
and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.
And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.
though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --
but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,
and all the rest of the countries.
So it's a fun little project.
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun
and see where it goes.
And --
well, I'll leave you in suspense.
Larry, you can explain this one.
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I
went to a Montessori school,
and I think, for some reason,
this has been incorporated in Google.
And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,
you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,
and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"
and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,
if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.
And many, many things at Google have come out of that,
such as Orkut and also Google News.
And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.
Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,
actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --
as a hobby, basically.
So many, many useful things come out of this.
was started by a researcher.
And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.
And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"
And so he started clustering it by category,
and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.
And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,
we made it a Googlette,
which is basically a small project at Google.
and they would try to make a product.
And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people
working on it for a while, and then more and more people
started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,
and more and more people started using it.
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.
And this is how we keep our innovation running.
they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.
And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,
"Oh, we really need a new concept."
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,
but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,
some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.
And I don't know about all of you,
but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.
And we found that if we just wrote all of them down
and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.
Don't really pay attention to them.
For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.
We would never do such a crazy thing, but --
in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,
that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but
we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,
which you did by writing them down,
that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do
and where to put your resources.
And so that's basically what we've done
since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative
and still stay reasonably well-organized.
and so naturally,
people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things
that are new, or you might not know about.
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?
Raise your hands.
All right, see? You guys should try it out.
But if you go to our site and search
for "Deskbar," you'll get this.
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time
on your screen on the bottom,
and you can do searches really easily.
And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.
Thank you, Sergey.
was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,
and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.
Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,
which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,
you can type a question in,
and then there's a pool of researchers
that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,
and you can get actually very good answers to things
without spending all that time yourself.
and Blogger lets you publish things.
But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --
you know, we try many, many different things
in our company.
We also like to innovate in our physical space,
and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time
for projectors to turn on and off,
and they're noisy, so people shut them off.
And we didn't like that, so we actually,
in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures
that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time
and they're completely silent.
And as a result, we were able to build some software
that also lets us manage a meeting,
so when you walk into a meeting room now,
it lists all the meetings that are happening,
you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically
to all the people that were present in the meeting.
we find these things really affect us --
you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?
And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.
We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,
and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.
And so we found it was pretty helpful
to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...
we also allow dogs and things like that,
and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,
which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.
I just wanted to show quickly.
We had this on our website for a while,
but we found that after we put it on our website,
we didn't get any job applications anymore.
But anyway, every year we've taken
the whole company on a ski trip.
A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.
And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.
It makes it a really fun place to work.
our culture when we change things.
In the early days, we were actually advised
we should never change our logo because
we should establish our brand, you know,
because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.
You want it to be consistent.
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.
Why don't we try changing it every day?"
is we have this thing called AdSense,
and this is a little bit foreshadowing --
this is from before Dean dropped out.
But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,
we show you relevant ads.
And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:
Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.
And these ads are generated automatically --
like in this case, on the Washington Post --
from the content on the site.
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers
and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one
that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,
much as we do on search.
So the idea is we can make advertising useful,
not just annoying, right?
we have a self-serve program,
and many thousands of websites have signed up,
and this let's them really make money. And I --
you know, there's a number of people I met --
I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,
and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.
I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.
And, you know, thank you.
I don't have to do my other job now."
And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.
It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,
when people can really make their livelihood
from producing great content.
so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.
And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,
you really have to be smart.
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,
and you expect an answer back, right?
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.
It would be artificial intelligence.
And so that's something we work on,
and we even have some people who are excited enough
and crazy enough to work on it now,
and that's really their goal.
So we always hope that Google will be smart,
but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.
This is a blog from Iraq,
and it's not really what
I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.
So we decided --
actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.
but we decided we should put in this feature
into our AdSense ads, called "related searches."
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this,
in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq --
and you know, in addition to the ads,
and we thought this would be a great idea.
of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,
"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."
He was just kind of writing about his life.
And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,
but our algorithms, our computers --
read his blog and decided that
the related search was, "I am bored."
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided
that he was boring,
and it was very unfortunate,
and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?
Why don't they like my blog?"
And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,
sort of going from bad to worse,
and we said the related search was, "Retards."
And then, you know, he got even more mad,
and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.
And then we produced "You suck."
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,
and of course, you know,
we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,
and it didn't quite work,
and we don't have this feature anymore.
I wanted to end just by saying that
there's a couple things that really make me excited
to be involved with Google,
and one of those is that we're able to make money
largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that
was that we're able to serve everyone in the world
without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.
So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,
for example, for less money in places that are poor,
and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --
for example, with the drug industry.
because everyone in the world has access to our search,
and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly
is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility
to provide people the right information,
and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --
that we should provide very objective information.
We accept payment for advertising,
and we mark it as such.
And that's unlike many of our competitors.
And I think decisions we're able to make like that
have a tremendous impact on the world,
and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.
So thank you.
So anyway, who am I?
I usually say to people, when they say, "What do you do?"
I say, "I do hardware,"
Valley event, to which he replied, "How quaint."
And I really should have said something smart.
And now I've had a little bit of time to think about it,
I would have said, "Well, you know,
if we look at the next 100 years
and we've seen all these problems in the last few days,
most of the big issues -- clean water, clean energy --
and they're interchangeable in some respects --
and cleaner, more functional materials --
they all look to me to be hardware problems.
This doesn't mean we should ignore software,
or information, or computation."
And that's in fact probably what I'm going to try and tell you about.
and what are the new ways that we're going to make things in the future.
Now, TED sends you a lot of spam if you're a speaker
and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist.
And I was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues I have,
and said, "You know, well, if I have to talk about the future, what is it?"
And George Homsey, a great guy, said, "Oh, the future is amazing.
It is so much stranger than you think.
but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening
that make this possible.
So, this isn't my work, but it's work of good friends of mine at MIT.
This is called the registry of standard biological parts.
This is headed by Drew Endy and Tom Knight
and a few other very, very bright individuals.
Basically, what they're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system.
Literally, think of proteins as subroutines
that you can string together to execute a program.
Now, this is actually becoming such an interesting idea.
This is a state diagram. That's an extremely simple computer.
So that's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches.
And this is being built by a group of students at Zurich
for a design competition in biology.
And from the results of the same competition last year,
a University of Texas team of students programmed bacteria
so that they can detect light and switch on and off.
So this is interesting in the sense that you can now
do "if-then-for" statements in materials, in structure.
This is a pretty interesting trend,
because we used to live in a world where everyone's said glibly,
"Form follows function," but I think I've sort of grown up in a world
-- you listened to Neil Gershenfeld yesterday;
I was in a lab associated with his -- where it's really a world
where information defines form and function.
and about that many pages to describe what I was doing,
and it took him one page. And so this is our muse Tucker.
is observing the self-assembly of his Cheerios in his cereal bowl.
And in fact you can program the self-assembly of things,
so he starts chocolate-dipping edges,
changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity.
In theory, if you program those sufficiently,
you should be able to do something pretty interesting
and make a very complex structure.
In this case, he's done self-replication of a complex 3D structure.
And that's what I thought about for a long time,
because this is how we currently make things.
This is a silicon wafer, and essentially
that's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff, sort of layered up.
The feature side is -- you know, people will say,
[unclear] down around about 65 nanometers now.
That's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans.
And that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers,
and it's a complex 3D structure.
We could do a lot more with computers and things generally
if we knew how to build things this way.
The secret to biology is, it builds computation
into the way it makes things. So this little thing here, polymerase,
is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating DNA.
And the ribosome here is another little computer
that helps in the translation of the proteins.
I thought about this
in the sense that it's great to build in biological materials,
but can we do similar things?
in inorganic systems?
Because there are some advantages to inorganic systems,
like higher speed semiconductors, etc.
on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system.
And this is sort of Babbage's revenge.
So, that's about three light switches lined up.
they will be able to replicate.
and then from two comes three.
And so you've got this sort of replicating system.
It was work actually by Lionel Penrose,
father of Roger Penrose, the tiles guy.
He did a lot of this work in the '60s,
So we've tracked in the video the input string,
which was green, green, yellow, yellow, green.
We set them off on this air hockey table.
You know, high science uses air hockey tables --
but what you're actually seeing is copies of that original string
emerging from the parts bin that you have here.
So we've got autonomous replication of bit strings.
So, why would you want to replicate bit strings?
Well, it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme,
that you can take a linear string, which is a convenient thing to copy,
and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3D structure.
So I was trying to, you know, take the engineer's version:
Can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials
the B -- assemble from a string of components
that follow extremely simple rules.
And the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here,
and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design,
was that you don't need digital logic to do computation.
And that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips.
So you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process.
but I'll show you again.
This is literally the colored sequence of those tiles.
Each different color has a different magnetic polarity,
and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out.
Now, hopefully, those of you who know anything about graph theory
can look at that, and that will satisfy you
that that can also do arbitrary 3D structure,
and in fact, you know, I can now take a dog, carve it up
and then reassemble it so it's a linear string
that will fold from a sequence. And now
I can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits.
So, you know, it's a pretty interesting world
when you start looking at the world a little bit differently.
And the universe is now a compiler.
And so I'm thinking about, you know, what are the programs
for programming the physical universe?
And how do we think about materials and structure,
sort of as an information and computation problem?
Not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point,
but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic, are the computers.
I started looking at a lot of problems a little differently.
With the universe as a computer,
you can look at this droplet of water
as having performed the computations.
You set a couple of boundary conditions, like gravity,
the surface tension, density, etc., and then you press "execute,"
and magically, the universe produces you a perfect ball lens.
So, this actually applied to the problem
of -- so there's a half a billion to a billion people in the world
don't have access to cheap eyeglasses.
So can you make a machine
that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site?
This is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition.
If it's circular, you make a spherical lens.
If it's elliptical, you can make an astigmatic lens.
You then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure --
so that's part of the extra program.
And literally with only those two inputs --
so, the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure --
you can define an infinite number of lenses
that cover the range of human refractive error,
from minus 12 to plus eight diopters, up to four diopters of cylinder.
And then literally, you now pour on a monomer.
You know, I'll do a Julia Childs here.
This is three minutes of UV light.
And you reverse the pressure on your membrane
once you've cooked it. Pop it out.
so with the new prototypes, actually both surfaces are flexible,
but this will show you the point.
Now you've finished the lens, you literally pop it out.
That's next year's Yves Klein, you know, eyeglasses shape.
And you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters.
And as I rotate it against this side shot, you'll see that that has cylinder,
and that was programmed in --
literally into the physics of the system.
So, this sort of thinking about structure as computation
and structure as information leads to other things, like this.
are working on at the moment, called "electronic rope."
So literally, you think about a rope. It has very complex structure in the weave.
And under no load, it's one structure.
Under a different load, it's a different structure. And you can actually exploit that
by putting in a very small number of
conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor.
So this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope
at any particular point in the rope.
Just by thinking about the physics of the world,
materials as the computer,
you can start to do things like this.
I guess I'm just going to casually tell you the types of things
and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense
the same way you share open source hardware?
And a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits
of having lots of people look at problems,
share the information and work on those things together.
So, a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time,
and unless Lisa Randall changes that,
we'll continue to move in linear time.
So that means anything you do, or anything you make,
you produce a sequence of steps --
and I think Lego in the '70s nailed this,
So, I'm thinking about, how can we generalize
the way we make all sorts of things,
so you end up with this sort of guy, right?
And I think this applies across a very broad -- sort of, a lot of concepts.
"How do I get everyone to collaborate on design
globally to do housing for humanity?"
And if you've seen Amy Smith,
she talks about how you get students at MIT
to work with communities in Haiti.
so that we can really share the information
on how you do those things in a more profound way
and build on each other's source code for structure.
like, is this a compiler? Is this a sub-routine?
Interesting things like that.
Maybe I'm getting a little too abstract, but you know,
this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters --
this is sort of the universe, or a different universe view,
it's sort of an analog computer.
But it's definitely an interesting new worldview.
I've probably got a couple of minutes of questions,
or I can show -- I think they also said that I do extreme stuff
in the introduction, so I may have to explain that.
So maybe I'll do that with this short video.
which also happens to be a minimal energy surface.
So returning to the droplet, again,
thinking about the universe in a new way.
This is a kite designed by a guy called Dave Kulp.
So I've been working on this a little, also,
with a couple of other guys.
But, you know, this is another way to look at the --
if you abstract again,
this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe.
You could just hang it as a bed sheet,
with systems like that. So that's sort of another interesting aspect of the future.
And to show the place where meditators, like me,
who began with being a molecular biologist in Pasteur Institute,
This is from Marlboro country.
This is the hottest day of the year somewhere in Eastern Tibet, on August 1.
And the night before, we camped, and my Tibetan friends said,
We like the ups and downs of life.
We like our suffering because it's so good when it ceases for a while."
It's about two meters by three, and you are all welcome any time.
And first of all, you know, despite what the French intellectuals say,
it seems that no one wakes up in the morning thinking,
"May I suffer the whole day?"
directly or indirectly, in the short or the long term,
But then, if you look in the literature, East and West,
Some people say, I only believed in remembering the past,
imagining the future, never the present.
Some people say happiness is right now;
so that each of them could define their own terms."
But now, if it is something that is going to determine
the quality of every instant of our life,
And probably, the fact that we don't know that is why, so often,
although we seek happiness, it seems we turn our back to it.
It is something that -- changes of nature.
Beautiful chocolate cake: first serving is delicious,
second one not so much, then we feel disgust.
I can hear it two, three, five times.
If I had to hear it 24 hours, non-stop, it might be very tiring.
And also, again, it can -- also, it's something that you --
it is not something that is radiating outside.
Like, you can feel intense pleasure
Because we are speaking of a different level.
You hit the solid rock.
When you are surfing on the top, you are all elated.
So you go from elation to depression -- there's no depth.
It can only be a state of being, not just a fleeting emotion, sensation.
Even joy -- that can be the spring of happiness.
something that we say, "Everything to be happy --
And also, when things go wrong, we try to fix the outside so much,
And isn't that stronger?
So one evening, he said, "Look, you are doing all these things,
but isn't it nice, also, to build something within?"
And he said, "[Without] that -- even if you get a high-tech flat
on the 100th floor of a super-modern and comfortable building,
if you are deeply unhappy within,
all you are going to look for is a window from which to jump."
So now, at the opposite,
we know a lot of people who, in very difficult circumstances,
manage to keep serenity, inner strength, inner freedom, confidence.
So now, if the inner conditions are stronger --
of course, the outer conditions do influence,
the inner conditions, and which are those which will undermine happiness.
So then, this just needs to have some experience.
There are some which are adverse to this well-being.
And so, if we look from our own experience,
And also, they are detrimental to others' happiness.
if from the distance, without anyone knowing anything about it,
we could save a child's life, make someone happy.
We don't need the recognition. We don't need any gratitude.
And if we look from the experiential point of view,
there is a primary quality of consciousness
Consciousness is like a mirror that allows all images to rise on it.
You can have ugly faces, beautiful faces in the mirror.
The mirror allows that, but the mirror is not tainted,
then it would be found all the time, somewhere.
is this pure cognitive quality that differentiates it from a stone,
there is a possibility for change because all emotions are fleeting.
Mind training is based on the idea that two opposite mental factors
cannot happen at the same time.
You could go from love to hate.
But you cannot, at the same time, toward the same object,
the same person, want to harm and want to do good.
So, there are natural antidotes to emotions
Likewise, if you look at the thought of anger,
it will vanish like frost under the morning sun.
If you do this again and again, the propensity,
the tendencies for anger to arise again
will be less and less each time you dissolve it.
like a bird crossing the sky without leaving any track.
But that's the only way to go.
It means familiarization with a new way of being,
with interdependence, with the stream and continuous transformation,
since we need to come to that, it was, I suppose, the subject of --
Now, recently, it has been found that it can change a lot.
A violinist, as we heard, who has done 10,000 hours of violin practice,
some area that controls the movements of fingers in the brain changes a lot,
So can we do that with human qualities?
They do, like, three years' retreat, where they do meditate 12 hours a day.
And then, the rest of their life, they will do three or four hours a day.
They are real Olympic champions of mind training.
Now, here with 256 electrodes.

Hopefully, they will come.
it's like coming out of a space ship.
Also, it has been shown in other labs --
for instance, Paul Ekman's labs in Berkeley --
Like the startle experiments, for example.
in 20 years, they never saw anyone who would not jump.
Some meditators, without trying to stop it,
they are able not to move at all.

Yet, we spend surprisingly little time taking care of what matters most --
Just this one example is worth a lot of work.

And we forgot that people made choices and decisions.
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier,
in our rush to do something about people in trouble,
it never occurred to us to develop interventions

That is, which ones actually make people lastingly happier?

And to ask that question -- "happy" is not a word I use very much --
And I believe there are three different --
it's possible to have one rather than the other --
three different happy lives.
The first happy life is the pleasant life.
and the skills to amplify it.
The second is a life of engagement:
That's what Aristotle was talking about.
And third, the meaningful life.
I want to say a little bit about each of those lives
and what we know about them.
it's having as many of the pleasures as you can,
and learning the skills -- savoring, mindfulness -- that amplify them,
that stretch them over time and space.
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks,
are 15 to 20 percent tricks, getting more of it.
I have to tell you about my friend Len,
to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion,
more than building pleasure.
In two of the three great arenas of life, by the time Len was 30,

that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him.
He's not consigned to the hell of unhappiness,

And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life.
And we think there's a recipe for it,

And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives,
how much life satisfaction do you get?

The pursuit of engagement is also very strong.

of pleasure, and of meaning in life?

it's not really about happiness.
So I decided instead, I would talk about someone

someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz,
and he's a great aficionado of medieval history.
And by profession, he's a psychophysicist.
Now, I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is,
who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics.
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said,
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer,
anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet.
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi,
at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent, 8.1, 8.2, 8.3,
and we plot the results on a curve,
Now, most people in that business, in the world of testing food and such,
Howard is not so easily placated.
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards.
And this was not good enough for him,
and this question bedeviled him for years.
And he would think it through and say, "What was wrong?
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi?"
about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafé.
And suddenly, like a bolt of lightning, the answer came to him.
And that is, that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data,
they were asking the wrong question.
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi,
This was an enormous revelation.
And people would look at him blankly and say,
"What are you talking about? Craziness."
And they would say, "Move! Next!"

it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way.
You'd have a plate of spaghetti, and you would pour it on, right?
And the Ragù would all go to the bottom, and the Prego would sit on top.
That's called "adherence."
And, anyway, despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence,
And Howard looked at their product line, and he said,
So he said, this is what I want to do.
He went to New York, to Chicago,
And after they ate each bowl, they had to rate, from 0 to 100,

about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce.
Instead, he looked at the data, and he said,
let's see if we can group all these different data points into clusters.
you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups.
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain;
there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy;
you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce.
And Prego turned to Howard, and they said,
took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country.
And that's when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar,
and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragù that he did for Prego.
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be

Even though at least a third of them, deep in their hearts, actually did.

What percentage of you actually like a dark, rich, hearty roast?
According to Howard, somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you.

Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize --
it's another very critical point --
In particular, they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon.
Used to be, there were two mustards: French's and Gulden's.
What were they? Yellow mustard.
They put it in a little tiny glass jar, with a wonderful enameled label on it,
Another pulls up, and says, "Do you have any Grey Poupon?"
There is no good mustard or bad mustard.
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard.
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people.

Howard not only believed that, but he took it a second step,
which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food,
And the example he used was coffee.
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee --

If, however, you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters,
maybe three or four coffee clusters,
and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters,

is a difference between coffee that makes you wince,
that in embracing the diversity of human beings,
When I first arrived in beautiful Zimbabwe,
it was difficult to understand that 35 percent of the population
is HIV positive.
It really wasn't until I was invited to the homes of people
that I started to understand the human toll of the epidemic.
For instance, this is Herbert with his grandmother.
When I first met him, he was sitting on his grandmother's lap.
He has been orphaned, as both of his parents died of AIDS,
and his grandmother took care of him until he too died of AIDS.
He liked to sit on her lap
because he said that it was painful for him to lie in his own bed.
When she got up to make tea, she placed him in my own lap
and I had never felt a child that was that emaciated.
Before I left, I actually asked him if I could get him something.
I thought he would ask for a toy, or candy,
and he asked me for slippers,
because he said that his feet were cold.
Single mother, HIV positive.
I photographed her before and after
the birth of her beautiful baby girl, Issa.
And I was last week walking on Lafayette Street in Manhattan
and got a call from a woman who I didn't know,
but she called to tell me that Joyce had passed away
at the age of 23.
Joyce's mother is now taking care of her daughter,
like so many other Zimbabwean children
who've been orphaned by the epidemic.
So a few of the stories.
With every picture,
there are individuals who have full lives
and stories that deserve to be told.
All these pictures are from Zimbabwe.
just to tell your own story of how you got to Africa?
for a fashion photographer.
And I was constantly reading the New York Times,
and stunned by the statistics, the numbers.
It was just frightening.
So I quit my job
and decided that that's the subject that I wanted to tackle.
And I first actually went to Botswana, where I spent a month --
this is in December 2000 --
then went to Zimbabwe for a month and a half,
and then went back again this March 2002
for another month and a half in Zimbabwe.
Zach Kaplan: Keith and I lead a research team.
We investigate materials and technologies
that have unexpected properties. Over the last three years,
we found over 200 of these things, and so we looked
back into our library and selected six we thought would be most
surprising for TED.
Of these six, the first one that we're going to talk about
is in the black envelope you're holding.
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech. Now go ahead and open it up.
What's unexpected about this is that it's soft, but it's also a strong magnet.
Zach and I have always been fascinated
observing unexpected things like this.
We spent a long time thinking about why this is, and it's just recently that we realized:
it's when we see something unexpected,
it changes our understanding of the way things work.
As you're seeing this gel magnet for the first time,
if you assume that all magnets had to be hard,
then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding
of the way magnets could work.
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible,
we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world.
So, a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors.
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material --
if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn't make a loud noise,
and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed.
Imagine taking the same material, but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker.
You know, this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those
metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door, in your closet,
and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf.
For me, I really love this idea.
(Laughter)
If you come to my apartment and see my closet,
I'm sure you'd figure out why: it's a mess.
applications -- it helps you see why this is significant, what the potential is.
But we've found that the way we present our ideas
it makes a big difference.
and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola.
He works on mostly music videos and commercials
with his company, The Directors Bureau.
As we were talking, Roman told us that he's kind of an inventor on the side.
And we were showing him the same
gel magnet that you're holding in your hand -- and you know,
we shared the same ideas. And you could see it in his face:
Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder;
he opens it up and Keith and I look in,
and he starts showing us concepts that he's been working on.
These things just get him really excited. And so we're looking
at these concepts, and we were just like, whoa, this guy's good.
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach
was totally different than ours. He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now.
When we were going in the car back to the airport,
we were thinking: why was this so powerful?
And as we thought about it more, we realized that
it let you fill in all the details about the experience,
just as if you saw it on TV. So, for TED we decided to take our favorite
idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team
at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product
from the future.
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself
on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide
so fast, so tall, that when you hit the bottom, it uses brakes to stop.
Aqua Rocket: coming this summer.
and they asked us, when's it coming out?
So I just wanted to let you know, it's not actually coming out,
just the concept is.
to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint.
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work.
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial.
The gel that you're holding would be lining the bottom of the board.
Now this is important for two reasons.
One: the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that, if it were
to hit the rider in the head, it wouldn't injure him.
In addition, you can see from the diagram on the right,
the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet.
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you're going down.
The force of the water rushing down, in addition to that repulsion force,
would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market.
It's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system.
When you get to the very bottom of the slide --
(Laughter)
-- the rider passes through an aluminum tube.
And I'm going to kick it to Keith to explain why that's important
from a technical standpoint.
a metal, it's not a magnetic material. But something unexpected
happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube.
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you.
(Laughter)
Now, you see the magnet fell really slowly.
Now, I'm not going to get into the physics of it,
but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet's falling,
the greater the stopping force.
and I have it right here in my pocket.
(Laughter)
There're a few different versions of it.
(Laughter)
KS: Some of them automatically unroll like this one.
They can be made to automatically roll up, or they can be made
stable, like Zach's, to hold any position in between.
how you could apply these, or how they're being applied currently --
he was telling us that, in the military they use this one
so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed --
and then, when they're out on the field, erect it as an antenna
to clearly send signals back to the base.
In our brainstorms, we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal:
so at the end of the game, you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag.
(Laughter)
you don't have to be an engineer to appreciate why
a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting.
(Laughter)
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago
and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this.
off my house -- I do it that way.
Woman: I'd make my very own walking stick.
Woman: I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree.
Woman: An olive server.
Man: Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use.
Woman: I would make a spear that, when you went deep sea diving,
you could catch the fish really fast, and then roll it back up,
and you could swim easier ... Yeah.
(Laughter)
and so we need a volunteer from the audience.
You sir, come on up.
(Laughter)
Come on up. Tell everybody your name.
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign.
Right there. That's great.
And hold onto this. Good luck to you.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
has been brought to you by Target.
Now, Zach, we're going to demonstrate
a water gun fight from the future.
(Laughter)
So here, come on up to the front. All right, so
now if you'll see here -- no, no, it's OK.
So, describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt. Go ahead.
into these squirt guns -- it's a dry liquid developed by 3M.
It's perfectly clear, it's odorless, it's colorless.
It's so safe you could drink this stuff.
(Laughter)
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates
25 times faster than water.
(Laughter)
All right, well thanks for coming up.
(Laughter)
so during the break you can shoot your friends.
SJ: Excellent, thank you.
(Applause)
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer.
Now, the unexpected thing about this
is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench
a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern
that we'd damage the electronics, that we'd get him wet,
that we'd hurt the books or the computers. It works because it's non-conductive.
So you can see here, you can immerse a whole circuit board
in this and it wouldn't cause any damage.
You can circulate it to draw the heat away.
But today it's most widely used in office buildings --
in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid.
Again, it's perfectly safe for people. It puts out the fires, doesn't hurt anything.
But our favorite idea for this
was using it in a basketball game. So during halftime,
it could rain down on the players, cool everyone down,
and in a matter of minutes it would dry. Wouldn't hurt the court.
called Sekisui Chemical. One of their R&D engineers
was working on a way to make plastic stiffer.
While he was doing this, he noticed an unexpected thing.
We have a video to show you.
an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing.
It's technically called, "shape-retaining property."
Now, think about your interactions with aluminum foil.
Shape-retaining is common in metal: you bend a piece of aluminum foil,
and it holds its place. Contrast that with
a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides
and it always bounces back.
but doesn't use a buckle.
Taking it a little further, if you wove
those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make
a shape-retaining sheet, and then you could embed it in a cloth:
so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table,
so that way on a windy day it wouldn't blow away.
For our next technology, it's hard to observe
the unexpected property by itself, because it's an ink.
So, we've prepared a video to show it applied to paper.
So with simple electronics, you can detect how much the page is being bent.
Now, to think about the potential for this,
think of all the places ink is supplied: on business cards,
on the back of cereal boxes, board games. Any place you use ink,
you could change the way you interact with it.
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper.
You see the dark line on the side and the top. As you turn the pages
of the book, the book can actually detect what page you're on,
based on the curvature of the pages.
In addition, if you were to fold in one of the corners, then you could program
the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes.
at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future
to explain how it works.
Who are you?
New Milk Carton: I'm New Milk.
OMC: I used to smell like you.
Narrator: Fresh Watch, from Inventables Dairy Farms.
Packaging that changes color when your milk's gone off.
Don't let milk spoil your morning.
Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow, of the University of Illinois.
And these dyes change color in response to odors.
So the smell of vanilla, that might change the four on the left to brown
and the one on the right to yellow. This matrix can produce
thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells.
But like in the milk commercial, if you know what odor you want to detect,
then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor.
and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible,
beyond just detecting spoiled food. It's really where the significance of it lies.
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn,
how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene?
And he kind of comically explained that
time after time, what the firemen would say is:
they would rush to the scene of the crime; they would look around;
if there were no dead policemen, it was OK to go.
(Laughter)
I mean, this is a true story. They're using policemen as canaries.
(Laughter)
But more seriously, they determined that you could develop
a device that can smell better than the humans,
and say if it's safe for the firemen.
In addition, he's spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing,
where they're working on medical equipment.
So, a patient can come in and actually blow into their device.
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria, or viruses,
or even lung cancer, the dots will change and they can use
software to analyze the results.
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients.
Currently, they're using a method of trial and error,
but this could tell you precisely what disease you have.
why we find these things so fascinating.
Because every one of these six changed our understanding
of what was possible in the world. Prior to seeing this,
we would have assumed: a 10-foot pole couldn't fit in your pocket;
something as inexpensive as ink couldn't sense the way paper is being bent;
every one of these things -- and we're constantly trying to find more.
I'm sure it's obvious to you now, but it was actually yesterday
that I was reminded of why. I was having a conversation
with Steve Jurvetson, over downstairs by the escalators,
and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box,
one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand --
the sand that doesn't get wet. He said that he was playing with it with his son.
And you know, his son was mesmerized,
because he would dunk it in the water, he would take it out
and it was bone dry. A few weeks later, he said that his son
was playing with a lock of his mother's hair, and he noticed
that there were some drops of water on the hair.
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said,
"Look, hydrophobic string."
(Laughter)
I mean, after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I grew up in Northern Ireland, right up in the
very, very north end of it there,
where it's absolutely freezing cold.
This was me running around in the back garden mid-summer.
In Ireland the obvious choice is the military,
but to be honest it actually kind of sucks.
But the problem was that people kept blowing everything up.
So I actually went to school in Belfast,
which was where all the action happened.
And this was a pretty common sight.
The school I went to was pretty boring.
They forced us to learn things like Latin.
The school teachers weren't having much fun,
the sports were very dirty or very painful.
So I cleverly chose rowing, which I got very good at.
until this fateful day, and I flipped over right in front
of the entire school.
And that was the finishing post right there.
But our school at that time got a grant from the government,
and they got an incredible computer -- the research machine 3DZ --
and they left the programming manuals lying around.
And so students like myself with nothing to do,
we would learn how to program it.
Also around this time, at home,
this was the computer that people were buying.
It was called the Sinclair ZX80. This was a 1K computer,
and you'd buy your programs on cassette tape.
because I heard that there's a prerequisite to speak here at TED --
you had to have a picture of yourself from the old days with big hair.
So I brought a picture with big hair.
So after the Sinclair ZX80 came along the very cleverly named
Sinclair ZX81.
There's a picture of a guy doing homework with his son.
That's what they thought they had built it for.
The reality is we got the programming manual
and we started making games for it.
We were programming in BASIC,
which is a pretty awful language for games,
so we ended up learning Assembly language
so we could really take control of the hardware.
This is the guy that invented it, Sir Clive Sinclair,
and he's showing his machine.
You had this same thing in America,
it was called the Timex Sinclair1000.
to believe that you were really playing "Battlestar Galactica."
The graphics were just horrible.
You had to have an even better imagination to play this game,
"Death Rider."
But of course the scientists couldn't help themselves.
They started making their own video games.
This is one of my favorite ones here, where they have rabbit breeding,
so males choose the lucky rabbit.
which was quite the leap.
And if you're wondering how much 16K is,
this eBay logo here is 16K.
And in that amount of memory someone programmed
a full flight simulation program.
And that's what it looked like.
I spent ages flying this flight simulator,
and I honestly believed I could fly airplanes by the end of it.
He's recognized as being the father of video games in Europe.
He's a multi-millionaire, and I think that's why he's
smiling in this photograph.
making a lot of different games.
Some of the highlights were things like "The Terminator,"
"Aladdin," the "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles."
Because I was from the United Kingdom,
they thought the word ninja was a little too mean for children,
so they decided to call it hero instead.
I personally preferred the Spanish version,
which was "Tortugas Ninja."
That was much better.
and Hollywood to actually work together on something --
instead of licensing from each other, to actually work.
so I've done that.
The video game industry in 2005 became a 29 billion dollar business.
It grows every year.
Last year was the biggest year.
By 2008, we're going to kick the butt of the music industry.
By 2010, we're going to hit 42 billion.
43 percent of gamers are female.
So there's a lot more female gamers than people are really aware.
Well, obviously it's for children, right?
Well, no, actually it's 30 years old.
And interestingly, the people who buy the most games are 37.
So 37 is our target audience.
All video games are violent.
Of course the newspapers love to beat on this.
But 83 percent of games don't have any mature content whatsoever,
so it's just not true.
I brought some stuff on "World of Warcraft." It's 5.5 million players.
It makes about 80 million bucks a month in subscriptions.
It costs 50 bucks just to install it on your computer,
making the publisher about another 275 million.
The game costs about 80 million dollars to make,
so basically it pays for itself in about a month.
A player in a game called "Project Entropia"
actually bought his own island for 26,500 dollars.
You have to remember that this is not a real island.
He didn't actually buy anything, just some data.
But he got great terms on it.
This purchase included mining and hunting rights,
ownership of all land on the island, and a castle
with no furniture included.
And what's interesting about it is the market was actually created
by the gamers themselves.
They found clever ways to trade items
and to sell their accounts to each other
so that they could make money while they were playing their games.
I dove onto eBay a couple of days ago
just to see what was gong on, typed in World of Warcraft, got 6,000 items.
I liked this one the best:
a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars.
It's like that guy obviously had some pain while making it.
what do you think these people are doing here?
It turns out they're actually in Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles
listening to the L.A. Philharmonic playing video game music.
That's what the show looks like.
You would expect it to be cheesy, but it's not.
It's very, very epic and a very beautiful concert.
And the people that went there absolutely loved it.
They're actually bringing their computers so they can play games
against each other.
And this is happening in every city around the world.
This is happening in your local cities too,
you're probably just not aware of it.
here just to show how video game graphics have been improving.
I wanted to update that video and give you a new look at it.
But what I want you to do is to try to understand it.
We're on this curve, and the graphics are getting
so ridiculously better.
And I'm going to show you up to maybe 2007.
But I want you to try and think about what games could look like
10 years from now.
So we're going to start that video.
As man's intellect and technology have evolved
so too have the games he plays.
don't look at these graphics and think of that's the way it is.
Think about that's where we are right now,
and the curve that we're on means that this is going to continue
to get better.
This is an example of the kind of graphics you need to be able to draw
if you wanted to get a job in the video game industry today.
You need to be really an incredible artist.
And once we get enough of those guys, we're going to want
more fantasy artists that can create places
we've never been to before, or characters that
we've just never seen before.
But if you were to go to a game developers conference,
what they're all talking about is emotion, purpose,
meaning, understanding and feeling.
You'll hear about talks like, can a video game make you cry?
And these are the kind of topics we really actually care about.
at expressing himself, and this student agreed
that he would not show his video to anybody until
you here at TED had seen it.
So I'd like to play this video.
So this is a student's opinion on what his experience of games are.
reality and video games.
Some part of me -- a true living, breathing person --
has become programmed, electronic and virtual.
The boundary of my brain that divides real from fantasy
has finally begun to crumble.
I'm a video game addict and this is my story.
the Nintendo Entertainment System also went into development.
I played in the backyard, learned to read,
and even ate some of my vegetables.
Most of my childhood was spent playing with Legos.
But as was the case for most of my generation,
I spent a lot of time in front of the TV.
Mr. Rogers, Walt Disney, Nick Junior,
and roughly half a million commercials have undoubtedly
left their mark on me.
whatever inherent addictive quality this early interactive
electronic entertainment possessed quickly took hold of me.
At some point something clicked.
and the warmth of the TV set, my simple 16-bit Nintendo
became more than just an escape.
It became an alternate existence, my virtual reality.
a certain number of hours I have spent playing,
or nights I have gone without sleep to finish the next level.
It is because I have had life-altering experiences in virtual space,
and video games had begun to erode my own understanding
of what is real and what is not.
I'm addicted, because even though I know I'm losing my grip on reality,
I still crave more.
in what unfolded before me on screen.
Today, after 20 years of watching TV geared to make me emotional,
even a decent insurance commercial can bring tears to my eyes.
I am just one of a new generation that is growing up.
A generation who may experience much more meaning
through video games than they will through the real world.
Video games are nearing an evolutionary leap,
a point where game worlds will look and feel just as real
as the films we see in theatres, or the news we watch on TV.
And while my sense of free will in these virtual worlds
may still be limited, what I do learn applies to my real life.
Play enough video games and eventually you will
really believe you can snowboard, fly a plane,
drive a nine-second quarter mile, or kill a man.
I know I can.
video games actually allow us to become part of the machine.
They allow us to sublimate into the culture of interactive,
downloaded, streaming, HD reality.
We are interacting with our entertainment.
I have come to expect this level of interaction.
Without it, the problems faced in the real world --
poverty, war, disease and genocide -- lack the levity they should.
Their importance blends into the sensationalized drama
of prime time TV.
the vibrating joysticks or virtual surround sound.
It lies in that these games are beginning to make me emotional.
I have fought in wars, feared for my own survival,
watched my cohorts die on beaches and woods that look and feel
more real than any textbook or any news story.
They know what makes me scared, excited, panicked, proud or sad.
Then they use these emotions to dimensionalize the worlds they create.
A well-designed video game will seamlessly
weave the user into the fabric of the virtual experience.
As one becomes more experienced
the awareness of physical control melts away.
I know what I want and I do it.
No buttons to push, no triggers to pull, just me and the game.
My fate and the fate of the world around me lie inside my hands.
I know violent video games make my mother worry.
What troubles me is not that video game violence
is becoming more and more like real life violence,
but that real life violence is starting to look more and more
like a video game.
I, however, have a problem very close to home.
Something has happened to my brain.
all of our gut instincts, the things we know to do
before we even think.
While some of these instincts may be innate, most are learned,
and all of them are hardwired into our brains.
These instincts are essential for survival in both real and virtual worlds.
Only in recent years has the technology behind video games
allowed for a true overlap in stimuli.
As gamers we are now living by the same laws of physics
in the same cities and doing many of the same things
we once did in real life, only virtually.
Consider this --
my real life car has about 25,000 miles on it.
In all my driving games, I've driven a total of 31,459 miles.
To some degree I've learned how to drive from the game.
The sensory cues are very similar.
It's a funny feeling when you have spent more time
doing something on the TV than you have in real life.
When I am driving down a road at sunset all I can think is,
this is almost as beautiful as my games are.
More beautiful and rich than the real world around us.
I'm not sure what the implications of my experience are,
but the potential for using realistic video game stimuli in repetition
on a vast number of loyal participants is frightening to me.
Today I believe Big Brother would find much more success
brainwashing the masses with video games
rather than just simply TVs.
Video games are fun, engaging, and leave your brain
completely vulnerable to re-programming.
But maybe brainwashing isn't always bad.
or helps us to understand the problems we're all facing
in the real world.
There is a potential to do good as well.
It is critical, as these virtual worlds continue to mirror
the real world we live in, that game developers realize
that they have tremendous responsibilities before them.
I'm not sure what the future of video games holds
for our civilization.
But as virtual and real world experiences increasingly overlap
there is a greater and greater potential for other people
to feel the same way I do.
is that beyond the graphics, sound, game play and emotion
it is the power to break down reality that is so fascinating
and addictive to me.
I know that I am losing my grip.
Part of me is just waiting to let go.
I know though, that no matter how amazing video games may become,
or how flat the real world may seem to us,
that we must stay aware of what our games are teaching us
and how they leave us feeling when we finally do unplug.
and that's why I wanted to bring it here for you guys to see.
And what was interesting about it is the obvious choice
for me to talk about was graphics and audio.
But as you heard, Michael talked about all these other elements as well.
Video games give an awful lot of other things too,
and that's why people get so addicted.
The most important one being fun.
Who is that going to come from?
Is it going to come from the best directors in the world
as we thought it probably would?
I don't think so.
I think it's going to come from the children who are growing up now
that aren't stuck with all of the stuff that we remember from the past.
They're going to do it their way, using the tools that we've created.
The same with students or highly creative people,
writers and people like that.
teaching video game courses.
That means there's literally thousands of new ideas.
Some of the ideas are really dreadful and some of them are great.
There's nothing worse than having to listen to someone
try and pitch you a really bad video game idea.
He's out of time.
The school is closed; they're coming back at midnight
because they want to pitch their video game ideas.
I'm sitting at the front of the class,
and they're actually pitching their ideas.
So it's hard to get students to come back to class,
but it is possible.
And I've been asking myself, what is Emma going to experience
in the video game world?
And as I've shown here, we have the audience.
She's never going to know a world where you can't press a button
and have millions of people ready to play.
You know, we have the technology.
She's never going to know a world where the graphics just aren't
stunning and really immersive.
And as the student video showed, we can impact and move.
She's never going to know a world where video games
aren't incredibly emotional and will probably make her cry.
I just hope she likes video games.
Games on the surface seem simple entertainment,
but for those that like to look a little deeper,
the new paradigm of video games could open entirely new frontiers
to creative minds that like to think big.
Where better to challenge those minds than here at TED?
Basically, there's a major demographic event going on.
And it may be that passing the 50 percent urban point
is an economic tipping point. So the world now is a map of connectivity.
What we have now is the end of the rise of the West. That's over.
The aggregate numbers are overwhelming.
So what's really going on? Well, villages of the world are emptying out.
And here's the unromantic truth -- and the city air makes you free,
they said in Renaissance Germany. So some people go to places
like Shanghai but most go to the squatter cities where aesthetics rule.
And these are not really a people oppressed by poverty.
They're people getting out of poverty as fast as they can.
They're the dominant builders and to a large extent, the dominant designers.
They have home-brewed infrastructure and vibrant urban life.
They are constantly upgrading, and in a few cases, the government helps.
Education is the main event that can happen in cities.
What's going on in the street in Mumbai?
Al Gore knows. It's basically everything.
There's no unemployment in squatter cities. Everyone works.
One-sixth of humanity is there. It's soon going to be more than that.
cities have defused the population bomb.
That's the news from downtown. Here it is in perspective.
Stars have shined down on earth's life for billions of years.
Now we're shining right back up.
This is a picture of Maurice Druon,
the Honorary Perpetual Secretary of L'Academie francaise,
the French Academy.
He is splendidly attired in his 68,000-dollar uniform,
befitting the role of the French Academy
as legislating the
correct usage in French
and perpetuating the language.
The French Academy has two main tasks:
it compiles a dictionary of official French.
They're now working on their ninth edition,
which they began in 1930, and they've reached the letter P.
They also legislate on correct usage,
such as the proper term for what the French call "email,"
which ought to be "courriel."
The World Wide Web, the French are told,
ought to be referred to as
"la toile d'araignee mondiale" -- the Global Spider Web --
recommendations that the French gaily ignore.
namely, it's legislated by an academy.
But anyone who looks at language realizes
that this is a rather silly conceit,
that language, rather, emerges from human minds interacting from one another.
And this is visible in the unstoppable change in language --
the fact that by the time the Academy finishes their dictionary,
it will already be well out of date.
constant appearance of slang and jargon,
of the historical change in languages,
in divergence of dialects
and the formation of new languages.
So language is not so much a creator or shaper of human nature,
so much as a window onto human nature.
In a book that I'm currently working on,
I hope to use language to shed light on
a number of aspects of human nature,
including the cognitive machinery
with which humans conceptualize the world
and the relationship types that govern human interaction.
And I'm going to say a few words about each one this morning.
that I've worried about for quite some time --
and indulge me
in my passion for verbs and how they're used.
The problem is, which verbs go in which constructions?
The verb is the chassis of the sentence.
It's the framework onto which the other parts are bolted.
of something that you've long forgotten.
An intransitive verb, such as "dine," for example,
can't take a direct object.
You have to say, "Sam dined," not, "Sam dined the pizza."
A transitive verb mandates
that there has to be an object there:
"Sam devoured the pizza." You can't just say, "Sam devoured."
There are dozens or scores of verbs of this type,
each of which shapes its sentence.
So, a problem in explaining how children learn language,
a problem in teaching language to adults so that they don't make grammatical errors,
and a problem in programming computers to use language is
which verbs go in which constructions.
You can say, "Give a muffin to a mouse," the prepositional dative.
Or, "Give a mouse a muffin," the double-object dative.
"Promise anything to her," "Promise her anything," and so on.
Hundreds of verbs can go both ways.
So a tempting generalization for a child,
for an adult, for a computer
is that any verb that can appear in the construction,
"subject-verb-thing-to-a-recipient"
can also be expressed as "subject-verb-recipient-thing."
A handy thing to have,
because language is infinite,
and you can't just parrot back the sentences that you've heard.
You've got to extract generalizations
so you can produce and understand new sentences.
This would be an example of how to do that.
You can say, "Biff drove the car to Chicago,"
but not, "Biff drove Chicago the car."
You can say, "Sal gave Jason a headache,"
but it's a bit odd to say, "Sal gave a headache to Jason."
The solution is that these constructions, despite initial appearance,
are not synonymous,
that when you crank up the microscope
on human cognition, you see that there's a subtle difference
in meaning between them.
So, "give the X to the Y,"
that construction corresponds to the thought
"cause X to go to Y." Whereas "give the Y the X"
corresponds to the thought "cause Y to have X."
kind of like the classic figure-ground reversal illusions,
in which you can either pay attention
to the particular object,
in which case the space around it recedes from attention,
or you can see the faces in the empty space,
in which case the object recedes out of consciousness.
How are these construals reflected in language?
Well, in both cases, the thing that is construed as being affected
is expressed as the direct object,
the noun after the verb.
So, when you think of the event as causing the muffin to go somewhere --
where you're doing something to the muffin --
you say, "Give the muffin to the mouse."
When you construe it as "cause the mouse to have something,"
you're doing something to the mouse,
and therefore you express it as, "Give the mouse the muffin."
the problem with which I began --
depends on whether the verb specifies a kind of motion
or a kind of possession change.
To give something involves both causing something to go
and causing someone to have.
To drive the car only causes something to go,
because Chicago's not the kind of thing that can possess something.
Only humans can possess things.
And to give someone a headache causes them to have the headache,
but it's not as if you're taking the headache out of your head
and causing it to go to the other person,
and implanting it in them.
You may just be loud or obnoxious,
or some other way causing them to have the headache.
So, that's
an example of the kind of thing that I do in my day job.
Well, there are a number of interesting conclusions, I think,
from this and many similar kinds of analyses
of hundreds of English verbs.
First, there's a level of fine-grained conceptual structure,
which we automatically and unconsciously compute
every time we produce or utter a sentence, that governs our use of language.
You can think of this as the language of thought, or "mentalese."
which govern dozens of constructions and thousands of verbs --
not only in English, but in all other languages --
fundamental concepts such as space,
time, causation and human intention,
such as, what is the means and what is the ends?
These are reminiscent of the kinds of categories
that Immanuel Kant argued
are the basic framework for human thought,
and it's interesting that our unconscious use of language
seems to reflect these Kantian categories.
Doesn't care about perceptual qualities,
such as color, texture, weight and speed,
which virtually never differentiate
the use of verbs in different constructions.
are used not only literally,
but in a quasi-metaphorical way.
For example, this construction, the dative,
is used not only to transfer things,
but also for the metaphorical transfer of ideas,
as when we say, "She told a story to me"
or "told me a story,"
"Max taught Spanish to the students" or "taught the students Spanish."
It's exactly the same construction,
but no muffins, no mice, nothing moving at all.
It evokes the container metaphor of communication,
in which we conceive of ideas as objects,
sentences as containers,
and communication as a kind of sending.
As when we say we "gather" our ideas, to "put" them "into" words,
and if our words aren't "empty" or "hollow,"
we might get these ideas "across" to a listener,
who can "unpack" our words to "extract" their "content."
It's very hard to find any example of abstract language
that is not based on some concrete metaphor.
For example, you can use the verb "go"
and the prepositions "to" and "from"
in a literal, spatial sense.
"The messenger went from Paris to Istanbul."
You can also say, "Biff went from sick to well."
He needn't go anywhere. He could have been in bed the whole time,
but it's as if his health is a point in state space
that you conceptualize as moving.
Or, "The meeting went from three to four,"
in which we conceive of time as stretched along a line.
Likewise, we use "force" to indicate
not only physical force,
as in, "Rose forced the door to open,"
but also interpersonal force,
as in, "Rose forced Sadie to go," not necessarily by manhandling her,
but by issuing a threat.
Or, "Rose forced herself to go,"
as if there were two entities inside Rose's head,
engaged in a tug of a war.
of a given event in two different ways,
such as "cause something to go to someone"
and "causing someone to have something,"
I think is a fundamental feature of human thought,
and it's the basis for much human argumentation,
in which people don't differ so much on the facts
as on how they ought to be construed.
Just to give you a few examples:
"ending a pregnancy" versus "killing a fetus;"
"a ball of cells" versus "an unborn child;"
"invading Iraq" versus "liberating Iraq;"
"redistributing wealth" versus "confiscating earnings."
And I think the biggest picture of all
would take seriously the fact
that so much of our verbiage about abstract events
is based on a concrete metaphor
and see human intelligence itself
as consisting of a repertoire of concepts --
such as objects, space, time, causation and intention --
which are useful in a social, knowledge-intensive species,
whose evolution you can well imagine,
and a process of metaphorical abstraction
that allows us to bleach these concepts
of their original conceptual content --
space, time and force --
and apply them to new abstract domains,
therefore allowing a species that evolved
to deal with rocks and tools and animals,
to conceptualize mathematics, physics, law
and other abstract domains.
the cognitive machinery with which we conceptualize the world,
and now I'm going to say a few words about the relationship types
that govern human social interaction,
again, as reflected in language.
And I'll start out with a puzzle, the puzzle of indirect speech acts.
Now, I'm sure most of you have seen the movie "Fargo."
And you might remember the scene in which
the kidnapper is pulled over by a police officer,
is asked to show his driver's license
and holds his wallet out
with a 50-dollar bill extending
at a slight angle out of the wallet.
And he says, "I was just thinking
that maybe we could take care of it here in Fargo,"
which everyone, including the audience,
interprets as a veiled bribe.
This kind of indirect speech is rampant in language.
For example, in polite requests,
if someone says, "If you could pass the guacamole,
that would be awesome,"
we know exactly what he means,
even though that's a rather bizarre
concept being expressed.
I think most people
understand the intent behind that.
And likewise, if someone says,
"Nice store you've got there. It would be a real shame if something happened to it" --
(Laughter) --
we understand that as a veiled threat,
rather than a musing of hypothetical possibilities.
So the puzzle is, why are bribes,
polite requests, solicitations and threats so often veiled?
No one's fooled.
Both parties know exactly what the speaker means,
and the speaker knows the listener knows
that the speaker knows that the listener knows, etc., etc.
So what's going on?
is a way of negotiating relationships,
and human relationships fall into a number of types.
There's an influential taxonomy by the anthropologist Alan Fiske,
in which relationships can be categorized, more or less,
into communality, which works on the principle
"what's mine is thine, what's thine is mine,"
the kind of mindset that operates within a family, for example;
dominance, whose principle is "don't mess with me;"
reciprocity, "you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours;"
and sexuality, in the immortal words of Cole Porter, "Let's do it."
Even though there are default situations
in which one of these mindsets can be applied,
they can be stretched and extended.
For example, communality applies most naturally
within family or friends,
but it can be used to try to transfer
the mentality of sharing
to groups that ordinarily would not be disposed to exercise it.
For example, in brotherhoods, fraternal organizations,
sororities, locutions like "the family of man,"
you try to get people who are not related
to use the relationship type that would ordinarily
be appropriate to close kin.
and another assumes a different one -- can be awkward.
If you went over and you helped yourself
to a shrimp off your boss' plate,
for example, that would be an awkward situation.
Or if a dinner guest after the meal
pulled out his wallet and offered to pay you for the meal,
that would be rather awkward as well.
In less blatant cases,
there's still a kind of negotiation that often goes on.
In the workplace, for example,
there's often a tension over whether an employee
can socialize with the boss,
or refer to him or her
on a first-name basis.
If two friends have a
reciprocal transaction, like selling a car,
it's well known that this can be a source
of tension or awkwardness.
In dating, the transition
from friendship to sex
can lead to, notoriously, various forms of awkwardness,
and as can sex in the workplace,
in which we call the conflict between a
dominant and a sexual relationship "sexual harassment."
Well, language, as a social interaction,
has to satisfy two conditions.
You have to convey the actual content --
here we get back to the container metaphor.
You want to express the bribe, the command, the promise,
the solicitation and so on,
but you also have to negotiate
and maintain the kind of relationship
you have with the other person.
The solution, I think, is that we use language at two levels:
the literal form signals
the safest relationship with the listener,
whereas the implicated content --
the reading between the lines that we count on the listener to perform --
allows the listener to derive the interpretation
which is most relevant in context,
which possibly initiates a changed relationship.
If you express your request as a conditional --
"if you could open the window, that would be great" --
even though the content is an imperative,
the fact that you're not using the imperative voice
means that you're not acting as if you're in a relationship of dominance,
where you could presuppose the compliance of the other person.
On the other hand, you want the damn guacamole.
By expressing it as an if-then statement,
you can get the message across
without appearing to boss another person around.
for all of the veiled speech acts
involving plausible deniability:
the bribes, threats, propositions,
solicitations and so on.
One way of thinking about it is to imagine what it would be like
if language -- where it could only be used literally.
And you can think of it in terms of a
game-theoretic payoff matrix.
Put yourself in the position of the
kidnapper wanting to bribe the officer.
There's a high stakes
in the two possibilities
of having a dishonest officer or an honest officer.
If you don't bribe the officer,
then you will get a traffic ticket --
or, as is the case of "Fargo," worse --
whether the honest officer
is honest or dishonest.
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
In that case, the consequences are rather severe.
On the other hand, if you extend the bribe,
if the officer is dishonest,
you get a huge payoff of going free.
If the officer is honest, you get a huge penalty
of being arrested for bribery.
So this is a rather fraught situation.
if you issue a veiled bribe,
then the dishonest officer
could interpret it as a bribe,
in which case you get the payoff of going free.
The honest officer can't hold you to it as being a bribe,
and therefore, you get the nuisance of the traffic ticket.
So you get the best of both worlds.
And a similar analysis, I think,
can apply to the potential awkwardness
of a sexual solicitation,
and other cases where plausible deniability is an asset.
I think this affirms
something that's long been known by diplomats --
namely, that the vagueness of language,
far from being a bug or an imperfection,
actually might be a feature of language,
one that we use to our advantage in social interactions.
reflecting human nature,
how we conceptualize reality,
how we relate to one another.
And then by analyzing the various quirks and complexities of language,
I think we can get a window onto what makes us tick.
Thank you very much.
If you haven't ordered yet, I generally find the rigatoni with the spicy tomato sauce
goes best with diseases of the small intestine.
No, what I want to do is take you back to 1854
in London for the next few minutes, and tell the story --
in brief -- of this outbreak,
which in many ways, I think, helped create the world that we live in today,
and particularly the kind of city that we live in today.
This period in 1854, in the middle part of the 19th century,
in London's history, is incredibly interesting for a number of reasons.
But I think the most important one is that
London was this city of 2.5 million people,
and it was the largest city on the face of the planet at that point.
But it was also the largest city that had ever been built.
and simultaneously invent a whole new scale of living:
this scale of living that we, you know, now call "metropolitan living."
And it was in many ways, at this point in the mid-1850s, a complete disaster.
They were basically a city living with a modern kind of industrial metropolis
with an Elizabethan public infrastructure.
So people, for instance, just to gross you out for a second,
had cesspools of human waste in their basement. Like, a foot to two feet deep.
And they would just kind of throw the buckets down there
and hope that it would somehow go away,
and of course it never really would go away.
And all of this stuff, basically, had accumulated to the point
where the city was incredibly offensive to just walk around in.
but also the sheer number of livestock in the city would shock people.
Not just the horses, but people had cows in their attics that they would use for milk,
that they would hoist up there and keep them in the attic
until literally their milk ran out and they died,
and then they would drag them off to the bone boilers down the street.
So, you would just walk around London at this point
and just be overwhelmed with this stench.
And what ended up happening is that an entire emerging public health system
became convinced that it was the smell that was killing everybody,
that was creating these diseases
that would wipe through the city every three or four years.
And cholera was really the great killer of this period.
another epidemic would take 10,000, 20,000 people in London
and throughout the U.K.
And so the authorities became convinced that this smell was this problem.
We had to get rid of the smell.
And so, in fact, they concocted a couple of early, you know,
founding public-health interventions in the system of the city,
one of which was called the "Nuisances Act,"
which they got everybody as far as they could
to empty out their cesspools and just pour all that waste into the river.
Because if we get it out of the streets, it'll smell much better,
and -- oh right, we drink from the river.
So what ended up happening, actually,
is they ended up increasing the outbreaks of cholera
because, as we now know, cholera is actually in the water.
It's a waterborne disease, not something that's in the air.
It's not something you smell or inhale; it's something you ingest.
than any modern day bioterrorist could have ever dreamed of doing.
So this was the state of London in 1854,
and in the middle of all this carnage and offensive conditions,
and in the midst of all this scientific confusion
about what was actually killing people,
it was a very talented classic 19th century multi-disciplinarian named John Snow,
who was a local doctor in Soho in London,
who had been arguing for about four or five years
that cholera was, in fact, a waterborne disease,
and had basically convinced nobody of this.
The public health authorities had largely ignored what he had to say.
And he'd made the case in a number of papers and done a number of studies,
but nothing had really stuck.
And part of -- what's so interesting about this story to me
is that in some ways, it's a great case study in how cultural change happens,
how a good idea eventually comes to win out over much worse ideas.
And Snow labored for a long time with this great insight that everybody ignored.
a young child, a five-month-old girl whose first name we don't know,
we know her only as Baby Lewis, somehow contracted cholera,
came down with cholera at 40 Broad Street.
You can't really see it in this map, but this is the map
that becomes the central focus in the second half of my book.
It's in the middle of Soho, in this working class neighborhood,
this little girl becomes sick and it turns out that the cesspool,
that they still continue to have, despite the Nuisances Act,
bordered on an extremely popular water pump,
local watering hole that was well known for the best water in all of Soho,
that all the residents from Soho and the surrounding neighborhoods would go to.
contaminating the water in this popular pump,
and one of the most terrifying outbreaks in the history of England
erupted about two or three days later.
Literally, 10 percent of the neighborhood died in seven days,
and much more would have died if people hadn't fled
after the initial outbreak kicked in.
So it was this incredibly terrifying event.
You had these scenes of entire families dying
over the course of 48 hours of cholera,
alone in their one-room apartments, in their little flats.
Just an extraordinary, terrifying scene.
Snow lived near there, heard about the outbreak,
and in this amazing act of courage went directly into the belly of the beast
because he thought an outbreak that concentrated
could actually potentially end up convincing people that,
in fact, the real menace of cholera was in the water supply and not in the air.
He suspected an outbreak that concentrated
would probably involve a single point source.
One single thing that everybody was going to
because it didn't have the traditional slower path
of infections that you might expect.
He eventually enlisted the help of this amazing other figure,
who's kind of the other protagonist of the book --
this guy, Henry Whitehead, who was a local minister,
he knew everybody in the neighborhood.
And he managed to track down, Whitehead did,
many of the cases of people who had drunk water from the pump,
or who hadn't drunk water from the pump.
And eventually Snow made a map of the outbreak.
He found increasingly that people who drank from the pump were getting sick.
People who hadn't drunk from the pump were not getting sick.
And he thought about representing that
as a kind of a table of statistics of people living in different neighborhoods,
people who hadn't, you know, percentages of people who hadn't,
but eventually he hit upon the idea
that what he needed was something that you could see.
Something that would take in a sense a higher-level view
of all this activity that had been happening in the neighborhood.
which basically ended up representing all the deaths in the neighborhoods
as black bars at each address.
And you can see in this map, the pump right at the center of it
and you can see that one of the residences down the way
had about 15 people dead.
And the map is actually a little bit bigger.
As you get further and further away from the pump,
the deaths begin to grow less and less frequent.
And so you can see this something poisonous
emanating out of this pump that you could see in a glance.
And so, with the help of this map,
and with the help of more evangelizing
that he did over the next few years
and that Whitehead did, eventually, actually,
the authorities slowly started to come around.
but by 1866, when the next big cholera outbreak came to London,
the authorities had been convinced -- in part because of this story,
in part because of this map -- that in fact the water was the problem.
and they immediately went to this outbreak
and they told everybody to start boiling their water.
And that was the last time that London has seen a cholera outbreak since.
So, part of this story, I think -- well, it's a terrifying story,
it's a very dark story and it's a story
that continues on in many of the developing cities of the world.
It's also a story really that is fundamentally optimistic,
which is to say that it's possible to solve these problems
if we listen to reason, if we listen to the kind of wisdom of these kinds of maps,
if we listen to people like Snow and Whitehead,
if we listen to the locals who understand
what's going on in these kinds of situations.
And what it ended up doing is making the idea
of large-scale metropolitan living a sustainable one.
in the space of seven days,
there was a widespread consensus that this couldn't go on,
that people weren't meant to live in cities of 2.5 million people.
But because of what Snow did, because of this map,
because of the whole series of reforms
that happened in the wake of this map,
we now take for granted that cities have 10 million people,
cities like this one are in fact sustainable things.
We don't worry that New York City is going to collapse in on itself
quite the way that, you know, Rome did,
and be 10 percent of its size in 100 years or 200 years.
And so that in a way is the ultimate legacy of this map.
It's a map of deaths that ended up creating a whole new way of life,
the life that we're enjoying here today. Thank you very much.
I thought perhaps if I was hanging on long enough,
But today what I'd like to talk to you about is that love of form
Not very long ago, not many thousands of years ago,
we actually lived in caves,
and I don't think we've lost that coding system.
We respond so well to form.
But I'm interested in creating intelligent form.
I'm in that world, but I work purely instinctively.
I'm not a scientist. I could have been, perhaps,
but I work in this world where I trust my instincts.
So I am a 21st-century translator of technology
into products that we use everyday and relate beautifully and naturally with.
and respect for the things that we dig out of the earth
and translate into products for everyday use.
had this amazingly instinctive curiosity.
I work from a similar position.
well into the 21st century, 500 years later.
It's my impression of water.
Impressionism being the most valuable art form on the planet as we know it:
all these people that I think are persevering and pioneering
with fantastic new ideas of how to create form.
This is all created digitally.
This is what I show to the client to say, "That's what I want to do."
That is like an Anish Kapoor flowing through a Richard Serra.
It felt like nothing. It has to feel like nothing.
It's an icon of water itself,
and it elevates people's perception of contemporary design.
It fits arthritic hands. It fits children's hands.
Biopolymers, these new ideas for materials,
will come into play in probably a decade.
It doesn't look as cool, does it?
But I can live up to that. I don't have a problem with that.
This is the freaky side coming out.
I have this special interest in things like this, which blow my mind.
and that strangeness is a consequence of innovative thinking.
When I look at these things, they look pretty normal to me.
when you get these things that take hundreds of millions of years to evolve?
How do you condense that?
It's a weird, kind of freaky place.
This is one of my specimens.
I studied cooking in school for four years, and in that experience,
All the guys in the rugby team couldn't understand.
It's made from polysaccharides and proteins.
If you pour water on that, it dissolves.
Could we be manufacturing from foodstuffs in the future?
These interrelated forms, they do inspire everything I do,
although I might end up making something incredibly simple.
This is a detail of a chair that I've designed in magnesium.
It shows this interlocution of elements and the beauty of, kind of, engineering
It shows how you make one holistic form, like the car industry,
and then you break up what you need.
This is an absolutely beautiful way of working.
It's a godly way of working.
It's organic and it's essential.
If you took the idea of fractal technology further, take a membrane,
shrinking it down constantly like nature does --
that could be a seat for a chair.
It could be a sole for a sports shoe.
It could be a car blending into seats.
Wow. Let's go for it. That's the kind of stuff.
It's called "Superliquidity." It's my sculptural investigation.
If he was a car designer, phew, we'd all be driving one.
In his day, he was the highest taxpayer in Britain.
our sense of relationships with things,
our sensuality and, you know, the sort of --
even the sort of socio-erotic side, which is very important.
which is a brand-new process here for the 21st century,
and I can hear Greg Lynn laughing his socks off as I say that.
I'll tell you about that later.
Those holes you see there are very filtered-down,
watered-down versions of the extremity of the diatomic structures.
It goes with the flow of the polymer and you'll see --
there's an image coming up right now that shows the full thing.
It's great to have companies in Italy who support this way of dreaming.
If you see the shadows that come through that,
The coring out of the back lets you breathe.
It takes away any material you don't need
as opposed to aluminium, and it's grown.
It's being built as we speak
and it will be on show in Phillips next year in New York.
I have a big show with Phillips Auctioneers.
When I see these animations, oh Jesus, I'm blown away.
Some guy's got that on a computer -- there's this like, oh my goodness.
So I try to create this energy of invention every day in my studio.
How you grow legs out of a surface.
I've had this image of a water droplet for 20 years, sitting on a hot bed.
That is an image of a car for me.
That's the car of the future. It's a water droplet.
How ridiculous is that? Couldn't you make that from 300?
transparent, so you can see the people in there.
You drive different.
I can see these bubbles with these hydrogen packages,
floating around on the ground, driven by AI.
everybody afterwards was going, "Hey, car on a stick. Like this."
it feels totally natural to me.
And that's what I do with my furniture.
I'm trying to build furniture which fits architecture.
I'm trying to build transportation systems.
I built this thing for my studio.
This is the data that goes with that. Incredibly complex.
Took about two years, because I'm looking for fat-free design.
You wouldn't want to have a fear of heights coming down it.
There is virtually no handrail. It doesn't pass any standards.
It's next to David Hockney's original studio.
It has a lighting system that changes throughout the day.
with some of the things that you'll see in the video.
It's a homemade video, made it myself at three o'clock in the morning
It's a new bio-polycarbonate chair I'm doing in Italy.
We should all be riding one of these.
I'm a contaminator for all those children of investment bankers -- wankers.
That thing on the top is the world's first solar-powered garden lamp --
amazing photography of things you can't see.
which allows me to remember what I've done, because I forget.
in Concepts for New Ceramics in Architecture.
We need to have a new instinct for the 21st century.
We need to combine all this stuff.
Let me show you some images
of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.
So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.
This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park
This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela
And this is Sultanbelyi,
which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,
the new urban world.
To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,
his name is Julius.
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.
So, I had been there almost three months,
and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas
and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed
and at certain points we were walking around,
he grabbed my hand for support,
which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.
And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,
and he's one of many.
migrate from the rural to the urban areas.
That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians
who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,
but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,
and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,
close to 70 million people a year.
And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.
So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,
between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.
And here are the statistics.
Today -- a billion squatters,
one in six people on the planet.
2030 -- two billion squatters,
one in four people on the planet.
And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,
better than one in three people on earth.
So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.
and before I show you the rest of my presentation,
I'm going to violate TED rules here,
and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception
of what we think the good life is.
It was a 10 by 10 cell.
Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.
Armstrong and his friends had no water --
they bought it from a nearby tap owner --
no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --
and no sewers or sanitation.
They did have electricity,
but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,
and could only power one feeble bulb.
This was Southland, a small shanty community
on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.
But it could've been anywhere in the city,
because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts
with no services, no toilets, no rights.
they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,
a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,
and they could not afford to be late with the money.
'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen
and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.
'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,
who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction
that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.
They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person
who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.
Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;
the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;
and we perspired as we ate.
put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border
between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.
It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.
And it was set in a wider watery ooze.
As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.
They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck
sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.
Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,
squatted, and defecated.
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.
When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,
a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.
But it stood in jarring contrast
to something Armstrong had said as we were eating --
that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.
Instead, the human spirit radiated out
from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something
no legal neighborhood could: freedom.
'This place is very addictive,' he had said.
'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.
Nobody is controlling what you do.
Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'
He meant back beyond that mountain of trash,
back in the legal city, of legal buildings,
with legal leases and legal rights.
'Once you have stayed here,' he said,
'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"
little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.
This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.
This is home improvement:
putting plastic tarps on your roof.
We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,
and plaster over the brick, some color,
and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door;
he's got new tile on the roof.
and you can see that it's getting even better.
The buildings here are multi-story.
They develop -- you can see on the far right
one where it seems to just stack on top of each other,
room, after room, after room.
And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,
and they sell their loggia or roof rights,
and someone else builds on top of their building,
and then that person sells the roof rights,
and someone else builds on top of their building.
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.
to a higher level of design.
The crud in the front is mattress stuffing,
and you see that all over Turkey.
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.
But the green building, on behind,
you can see that the top floor is not occupied,
so people are building with the possibility of expansion.
And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.
which is built on the suburban model.
Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.
They're quite vital places, these communities.
and there's a bus route that runs through it,
lots of people out on the street.
These communities in these cities are actually more vital
than the illegal communities.
They have more things going on in them.
these are how you get around the community.
It's on very steep ground.
They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,
and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.
So, that's just a rock in the hillside.
And these becos are normally very crowded,
and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,
all sorts of things.
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.
so close to the train tracks that the merchants
sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.
This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,
lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.
and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,
two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.
This here, on the right-hand side,
is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --
it's a hotel.
And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.
So, that's a restaurant.
People tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"
and they steal the electrical power
and wire the neighborhood.
People burn trash to get rid of the garbage,
and they dig their own sewer channels.
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.
And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.
And when they have more money they cement their streets,
and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.
This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,
and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:
they steal electricity; they install a pump
and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.
to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?
I say there are two things.
One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.
That does not necessarily mean property rights,
and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,
because property rights create a lot of complications.
They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt
and have to pay back the debt,
and sometimes have to sell their property
in order to pay back the debt.
There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights
sometimes don't work in these cases,
but they do need security of tenure.
And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.
That can mean community organizing from below,
but it can also mean possibilities from above.
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.
One is that -- it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,
which means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight
in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,
if they don't catch you during the night.
And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people
in the community, you can petition the government
to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.
And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.
You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,
provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.
The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family
on the tent along the same highway median.
They're very outspoken. They're very active.
They can be community leaders.
This woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.
And there were three old ladies who lived in --
that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,
and they are the backbone of the community there.
and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.
He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,
and the people in the neighborhood,
and is a great resource in the community.
the fruit merchant with his two kids here,
and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.
and in our ability to work with those people.
So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,
from what Armstrong said, and from all these people,
is that these are neighborhoods.
The issue is not urban poverty.
The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.
The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --
this is a legitimate form of urban development --
and that cities have to engage these residents,
because they are building the cities of the future.
I'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions
that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people,
which we will hope to see happen.
We discussed, in the prior film, some of the old things that we did,
like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic.
And I'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions
that will change the lives of many people.
after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient,
before that patient arrives at an emergency room.
And people with silent ischemia --
which, translated into English, means they don't have any symptoms --
it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital.
The AMI, Acute Myocardial Infarction,
which is a doctor's big word so they can charge you more money --
(Laughter)
-- means a heart attack. Annual incidence: 1.2 million Americans.
Mortality: 300,000 people dying each year.
About half of them, 600,000, have permanent damage to their heart
that will cause them to have very bad problems later on.
Thus 900,000 people either have died
or have significant damage to their heart muscle.
Symptoms are often denied by the patient, particularly us men,
because we are very brave. We are very brave,
and we don't want to admit that I'm having a hell of a chest pain.
Then, approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms.
What are we going to do about them? How can we save their lives?
It's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women.
A means to determine if there's a complete blockage of a coronary artery.
That, ladies and gentlemen, is a heart attack.
The means consist of noting something a little technical,
ST segment elevation of the electrogram --
translated into English, that means that
if there's an electrical signal in the heart, and one part of the ECG --
which we call the ST segment -- elevates,
that is a sure sign of a heart attack.
And if we had a computer put into the body of a person who's at risk,
we could know, before they even have symptoms,
that they're having a heart attack, to save their life.
Well, the doctor can program a level of this ST elevation voltage
that will trigger an emergency alarm,
vibration like your cell phone, but right by your clavicle bone.
And when it goes beep, beep, beep, you better do something about it,
because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment.
because the FDA won't just let us use them on people
unless we try it out first,
and the best model for this happens to be pigs.
And what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin,
like you see in an emergency room,
and I'm going to show you why they don't work very well.
And then we put a lead, which is a wire, in the right ventricle inside the heart,
which does the electrogram, which is the signal voltage from inside the heart.
Well, with the pig, at the baseline,
before we blocked the pig's artery to simulate a heart attack, that was the signal.
After 43 seconds, even an expert couldn't tell the difference,
and after three minutes -- well,
if you really studied it, you'd see a difference.
But what happened when we looked inside the pig's heart, to the electrogram?
Second of all, I'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference,
and we see here an ST segment elevation right after this sharp line.
Look at the difference there. It doesn't take much --
every layperson could see that difference,
and computers can be programmed to easily detect it.
Then, look at that after three minutes.
We see that the signal that's actually in the heart,
we can use it to tell people that they're having a heart attack
even before they have symptoms so we can save their life.
we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in.
Well, he kept the balloon filled to block the artery,
to simulate a blockage, which is what a heart attack is.
And it's not hard to see that -- the baseline
is the first picture on the upper left.
Next to it, at 30 seconds, you see this rise here,
then this rise -- that's the ST elevation.
And if we had a computer that could detect it,
we could tell you you're having a heart attack so early
it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure.
And then he did it again. We filled the balloon again a few minutes later
and here you see, even after 10 seconds, a great rise in this piece,
which we can have computers inside, under your chest like a pacemaker,
with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker.
And computers don't go to sleep.
We have a little battery and on this little battery
that computer will run for five years without needing replacement.
Well, on the left is the IMD, which is Implantable Medical Device,
and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they've exhibited it.
It's about this big, the size of a pacemaker.
It's implanted with very conventional techniques.
And the EXD is an External Device that you can have on your night table.
It'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room
when the thing goes off because, if you don't, you're in deep doo-doo.
And then, finally, a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation,
which is the level which says you are having a heart attack.
which we said is a pig, so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack.
And when you go to the farmyard, you can't easily get pigs to have heart attacks,
so we said, well, we're experts in stents.
Tonight you'll see some of our invented stents.
We said, so we'll put in a stent,
but we're not going to put in a stent that we'd put in people.
We're putting in a copper stent,
and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks.
That's not very nice, but, after all, we had to find out what the answer is.
So we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig,
and let me show you the result that's very gratifying
as far as people who have heart disease are concerned.
and there is his electrogram, the signal from inside the pig's heart
coming out by radio telemetry.
Then, on Friday at 6:43, he began to get certain signs,
which later we had the pig run around --
I'm not going to go into this early stage.
But look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig's medication
that kept him from having a heart attack.
Any one of you now is an expert on ST elevation. Can you see it there?
Can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the QRS -- you see ST elevation?
This pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack.
What happens after you have the heart attack, this blockage?
Your rhythm becomes irregular, and that's what happened 45 minutes later.
Then, ventricular fibrillation, the heart quivers instead of beats --
this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died; it went flat-line.
But we had a little bit over an hour where we could've saved this pig's life.
Well, because of the FDA, we didn't save the pig's life,
because we need to do this type of animal research for humans.
But when it comes to the sake of a human, we can save their life.
We can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack.
Well, you feel some chest pain or indigestion.
It's not all that bad; you decide not to do anything.
Several hours pass and it gets worse, and even the man won't ignore it.
Finally, you go to the emergency room.
You wait as burns and other critical patients are treated,
because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains
don't have AMI, so you're not taken very seriously.
They finally see you. It takes more time
to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it,
and it's hard to do because they don't have the baseline data,
which the computer we put in you gets.
Finally, if you're lucky, you are treated in three or four hours after the incident,
but the heart muscle has died.
And that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not Africa --
that's the typical treatment in the advanced world today.
and we have a device inside this patient, called the Implanted AngelMed Guardian.
And when you have a blockage, the alarm goes off
and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device,
which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago
and the one that caused the alarm, so you can take it to the emergency room
and show them, and say, take care of me right away.
Then it goes to a network operations center,
where they get your data from your patient database
that's been put in at some central location, say, in the United States.
Then it goes to a diagnostic center, and within one minute of your heart attack,
your signal appears on the screen of a computer
and the computer analyzes what your problem is.
And the person who's there, the medical practitioner, calls you --
this is also a cell phone -- and says,
"Mr. Smith, you're in deep doo-doo; you have a problem.
We've called the ambulance. The ambulance is on the way.
It'll pick you up, and then we're going to call your doctor, tell him about it.
We're going to send him the signal that we have, that says you have a heart attack,
and we're going to send the signal to the hospital
and we're going to have it analyzed there,
and there you're going to be with your doctor
and you'll be taken care of so you won't die of a heart attack."
That's the first invention that I wanted to describe.
(Applause)
At first I didn't think migraine headaches were a big problem
because I'd never had a migraine headache,
but then I spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life,
and their lives are being totally ruined by it.
We have a mission statement for our company doing migraine, which is,
"Prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches
by the application of a safe, controlled magnetic pulse
applied, as needed, by the patient."
Now, you're probably very few physicists here.
If you're a physicist you'd know there's a certain Faraday's Law,
which says if I apply a magnetic pulse on salt water --
that's your brains by the way --
it'll generate electric currents, and the electric current in the brain
can erase a migraine headache.
That's what we have discovered.
The patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura
have a band of excited neurons -- that's shown in red --
that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain.
And when it hits the mid-brain, that's when the headache begins.
There's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura,
and this visual aura, by the way -- and I'll show you a picture --
but it sort of begins with little dancing lights,
gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field.
And what we tried was this; here is a device called the Cadwell Model MES10.
Weighs about 70 pounds, has a wire about an inch in diameter.
And here's one of the patients who has an aura
and always has a headache, bad one, after the aura. What do we do?
It's sort of funny dancing lights, shown there on the left and right side.
And that's a fully developed visual aura, as we see on top.
In the middle, our experimentalist, the neurologist, who said,
"I'm going to move this down a little and I'm going to erase half your aura."
And, by God, the neurologist did erase it, and that's the middle picture:
half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse.
What does that mean?
That means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current
that's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain.
And finally he says, "OK, now I'm going to -- "
all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse.
that looks like this, that you could have -- a lady, in her pocket book --
and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works.
Well, the next thing they have to show is what was on ABC News,
Channel 7, last week in New York City, in the 11 o'clock news.
and there are 30 million Americans who do -- tonight: a possible answer.
Eyewitness news reporter Stacy Sager tonight, with a small and portable machine
that literally zaps your migraines away.
Christina Sidebottom: Well, my first reaction was that it was --
looked awfully gun-like, and it was very strange.
Stacy Sager: But for Christina Sidebottom, almost anything was worth trying
if it could stop a migraine.
It may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse,
but researchers here in Ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper,
say it is scientifically sound --
that, in fact, when the average person gets a migraine,
it's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse.
The zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that.
Yousef Mohammed: In other words, we're treating electricity with electricity,
rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we're using nowadays.
SS: But is it safe to use everyday?
Experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade,
and more long-term studies need to be done. Christina now swears by it.
CS: It's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine.
SS: Researchers are hoping to present their studies to the FDA this summer.
(Applause)
You see, the problem is, 30 million Americans have migraine headaches,
and we need a means to treat it, and I think that we now have it.
And this is the first device that we did, and I'm going to talk about my second wish,
which has something to do with this.
Our conclusions from our studies so far, at three research centers,
is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once.
The most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times,
and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches,
not only those with aura, get treated and get diminished.
And auras can be erased and the migraine, then, does not occur.
And that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on.
(Applause)
Epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation.
Now, why do we use -- add on, nearly, an epileptic focus?
Now, unfortunately, us technical people, unlike Mr. Bono,
have to get into all these technical words.
Well, "responsive electrical stimulation" means
that we sense, at a place in your brain which is called an "epileptic focus,"
which is where the epileptic seizure begins --
we sense there, that it's going to happen,
and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot,
which erases the errant signal
so that you don't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache.
We use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that's used for the heart.
We thought we could adapt it for the brain.
The device could be implanted under the scalp
to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage,
which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around.
Form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy,
as well as other diseases of the brain, because all diseases of the brain
are a result of some electrical malfunction in it,
that causes many, if not all, of brain disorders.
and we started work on responsive neurostimulation,
and this is a picture of what the device looked like,
that's placed into the cranial bone.
This is probably a better picture.
Here we have our device in which we put in a frame.
There's a cut made in the scalp; it's opened; the neurosurgeon has a template;
he marks it around, and uses a dental burr
to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device.
And tonight, you'll be able to see the device in the tent.
And then with four screws, we put in a frame,
then we snap in the device and we run with wires --
the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes,
to the epileptic focus, the origin of the epilepsy,
where we can sense the electrical signal
and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current
to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure.
In the blue wire, we see what's called a deep brain electrode.
If that's the source of the epilepsy, we can attack that as well.
it's about one inches by two inches and, oddly enough,
just the thickness of most cranial bones.
The advantages of responsive neurostimulation:
It can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur,
provide stimulation only when needed,
can be turned off if seizures disappear; it has minimal side effects --
as a matter of fact, in all our clinical trials to date,
we've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it's been implanted --
and it's invisible, cosmetically hidden,
so, if you have epilepsy and you have the device,
no one will know it because you can't tell that it's there.
And this shows what an electroencephalogram is,
and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients.
Then we stimulated, and you see how that heavy black line
and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal,
which means they did not get the epileptic seizure.
That concludes my discussion of epilepsy,
which is the third invention that I want to discuss here this afternoon.
(Applause)
I'm a tech; I'm into medical gadgetry,
which is mostly high-tech stuff like Mr. Bono talked about.
The first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator,
called RNS, for Responsive NeuroStimulator -- that's a brilliant acronym --
for the treatment of other brain disorders.
Well, if we're going to do it for epilepsy, why the hell not try it for something else?
Then you saw what that device looked like,
that the woman was using to fix her migraines?
I tell you this: that's something which some research engineer like me would concoct,
not a real designer of good equipment.
(Laughter)
We want to have some people, who really know how to do this,
perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design
for the portable device for treating migraine headaches.
And some of the sponsors of this TED meeting are such organizations.
Then we're going to challenge the TED attendees
to come up with a way to improve health care in the USA,
where we have problems that Africa doesn't have.
And by reducing malpractice litigation --
malpractice litigation is not an African problem; it's an American problem.
(Applause)
the brain operates by electrical signals.
If the electrical signals create a brain disorder,
electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain's neurons.
In other words, if you've screwed up electrical signals,
maybe, by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain,
we can counteract that.
A signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction
might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation
like we're doing with epilepsy.
But even if there is no signal,
electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder.
And consider treating psychotic disorders --
and I want this involved with the TED group --
such as obsessive-compulsive disorder
that, presently, is not well treated with drugs, and includes five million Americans.
And Mr. Fischer, and his group at NeuroPace, and myself believe
that we can have a dramatic effect in improving OCD in America and in the world.
That is the first wish.
(Applause)
the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators --
that's what TMS means, device to treat migraine headaches --
appears to be quite successful.
Well, that's the good news.
The present portable device is far from optimally designed,
both as to human factors as appearance.
I think she said it looks like a gun. A lot of people don't like guns.
(Laughter)
Engage a company having prior successes
for human factors engineering and industrial design
to optimize the design of the first portable TMS device
that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches.
And that is the second wish.
(Applause)
I am donating 50,000 dollars to the NeuroPace people
to get on with the treatment of OCD, obsessive-compulsive disorder,
and I'm making another 50,000 available for a company
to optimize the design of the device for migraines.
And that's how I'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money.
(Applause)
unfortunately, it's much more complicated because it involves lawyers.
(Laughter)
Well, medical malpractice litigation in the US
has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance,
so that competent physicians are leaving their practice.
Lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share
of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury, because this patient really ended up badly.
The high cost of health care in the US is partly due to litigation and insurance costs.
I've seen pictures, graphs in today's USA Today
showing it skyrocketing out of control, and this is one factor.
Well, how can the TED community help with this situation?
As a starting point for discussion with the TED group,
a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent
of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign.
For example, I asked the epilepsy people
what are they using for informed consent.
Would you believe, 12 pages, single space,
the patient has to read before they're in our trial to cure their epilepsy?
What do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages?
They don't understand what the hell it's about.
(Laughter)
That's the present system. How about making a video?
We have entertainment people here;
we have people who know how to do videos,
with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation.
Everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing
that can be interactive with the patient, where they see the video
and they're being videoed and they press, do you understand this? No, I don't.
Well, then let's go to a simpler explanation.
Then there's a simpler one and, oh yes, I understand that.
Well, press the button and you're on record, you understand.
And that is one of the ideas.
with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done,
including all the possible failure modes.
The patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit
if one of the known procedure failures occurs.
Now, in America, in fact, you cannot give up your right to trial by jury.
However, if a video is there that everything was explained to you,
and you have it all in the video file,
it'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer
will take this case on contingency, because it won't be nearly as good a case.
If a medical error occurs, the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement
for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court.
That would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the United States
and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone.
And, so there, that's the end of all my wishes.
I wish I had more wishes but three is what I've got and there they are.
(Applause)
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress
tell a very well known interviewer on television,
"I'm really getting into the Internet lately.
I just wish it were more organized."
So ...
(Laughter)
If I controlled the Internet,
you could auction your broken heart on eBay.
Take the money; go to Amazon;
buy a phonebook for a country you've never been to -- call folks at random
until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language.
you could Mapquest your lover's mood swings.
Hang left at cranky, right at preoccupied,
U-turn on silent treatment,
all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin'.
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection.
Some days, I'm as shallow as a baking pan,
but I still stretch miles in all directions.
If I owned the Internet, Napster, Monster and Friendster.com
would be one big website.
That way you could listen to cool music
while you pretend to look for a job
and you're really just chattin' with your pals.
(Laughter) --
but you'd get an automated reply.
Their name in your inbox
(Laughter) --
it's all you wanted anyway.
And a message saying, "Hey, it's me. I miss you.
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy."
If I designed the Internet, childhood.com would be a loop
of a boy in an orchard, with a ski pole for a sword,
trashcan lid for a shield, shouting, "I am the emperor of oranges.
I am the emperor of oranges. I am the emperor of oranges."
Now follow me, OK?
One, two, three.
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather.
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
He forms an attachment to
kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom,
who downloads the boy in the orchard, the emperor of oranges,
who grows up to be me --
the guy who usually goes too far.
So if I were emperor of the Internet,
I guess I'd still be mortal, huh?
But at that point, I would probably
already have the lowest possible mortgage
and the most enlarged possible penis
(Laughter) --
so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office.
I wouldn't need it.
I'd be like some kind of Internet genius, and me,
I'd like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that --
pop! -- I'd go wireless.
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus
until the World Wide Web is as wise, as wild and as organized
as I think a modern-day miracle/oracle can get, but, ooh-eee,
you want to bet just how whack and un-PC
your Mac or PC is going to be when I'm rocking
hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net?
I guess it's just like life.
It is not a question of if you can --
it's: do ya?
We can interfere with the interface.
We can make "You've got Hallelujah" the national anthem of cyberspace
every lucky time we log on.
You don't say a prayer.
You don't write a psalm.
You don't chant an "om."
You send one blessed email to whomever you're thinking of
at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
Thank you, TED.
Mockingbirds are badass.
They are.
Mockingbirds -- that's Mimus polyglottos --
are the emcees of the animal kingdom.
They rock the mic outside my window every morning.
I can hear them sing the sounds of the car alarms
like they were songs of spring.
I mean, if you can talk it, a mockingbird can squawk it.
So check it, I'm gonna to catch mockingbirds.
I'm going to trap mockingbirds all across the nation
and put them gently into mason jars like mockingbird Molotov cocktails.
say, where people got-a-lotta, I'll take a mockingbird I caught
in a neighborhood where folks ain't got nada and just let it go, you know.
Up goes the bird, out come the words, "Juanito, Juanito,
vente a comer mi hijo!"
Oh, I'm going to be the Johnny Appleseed of sound.
with a big backseat, packing like 13 brown paper Walmart bags
full of loaded mockingbirds, and I'll get everybody.
"We'll be back in a moment with more on the crisis."
I'll get some asshole at a watering hole asking what brand the ice is.
I'll get that lady at the laundromat who always seems to know what being nice is.
I'll get your postman making dinner plans.
I'll get the last time you lied.
I'll get, "Baby, just give me the frickin' TV guide."
I'll get a lonely, little sentence with real error in it,
"Yeah, I guess I could come inside, but only for a minute."
I'll put a mockingbird on a late-night train just to get an old man snoring.
I'll get your ex-lover telling someone else, "Good morning."
I'll get everyone's good mornings.
I don't care how you make 'em.
Aloha. Konichiwa. Shalom. Ah-Salam Alaikum.
Everybody means everybody, means everybody here.
And so maybe I'll build a gilded cage.
I'll line the bottom with old notebook pages.
Inside it, I will place a mockingbird for --
short explanation, hippie parents.
Where in the world is this world heading?
On one end, gold bars --
on the other, an entire planet.
We are 12 billion light years from the edge.
That's a guess.
Space is length and breadth continued indefinitely,
but you cannot buy a ticket to travel commercially to space in America
because countries are beginning to eat like us, live like us and die like us.
You might wanna avert your gaze, because that
is a newt about to regenerate its limb,
and shaking hands spreads more germs than kissing.
There's about 10 million phage per job.
It's a very strange world inside a nanotube.
Women can talk; black men ski; white men build strong buildings;
we build strong suns.
The surface of the Earth is absolutely riddled with holes,
and here we are, right in the middle.
When all the little mockingbirds fly away,
they're going to sound like the last four days.
I will get uptown gurus, downtown teachers,
broke-ass artists and dealers, and Filipino preachers, leaf blowers,
bartenders, boob-job doctors, hooligans, garbage men,
your local Congressmen in the spotlight, guys in the overhead helicopters.
Everybody gets heard.
Everybody gets this one, honest mockingbird as a witness.
And I'm on this.
I'm on this 'til the whole thing spreads,
with chat rooms and copycats and moms maybe tucking kids into bed
singing, "Hush, little baby, don't say a word.
Wait for the man with the mockingbird."
the man-in-the-street interviews, and the letters to the editor.
Everybody asking, just who is responsible for this citywide,
nationwide mockingbird cacophony, and somebody finally is going to tip
the City Council of Monterey, California off to me,
and they'll offer me a key to the city.
A gold-plated, oversized key to the city
and that is all I need, 'cause if I get that, I can unlock the air.
I'll listen for what's missing, and I'll put it there.
Thank you, TED.
And I say, "That I got to write it."
And I'm often asked,
This thing's selling still about a million copies a month."
is a universal disease.
I do believe what Chris said; I believe that you're not an accident.
I think there are accidental parents; there's no doubt about that.
and the significance level of living is:
Do you figure out, "What on Earth am I here for?"
and say, "But why can't I figure out my problems?"
Why do I feel like a fake?
I think it comes down to this issue of:
because it makes my life work a whole lot easier.
As a pastor, I do see a lot of kooks.
There are secular kooks; there are smart kooks, dumb kooks.
And that was: What is the purpose of this?
And it brought in a lot of attention, neither of which I wanted.
When I started Saddleback Church, I was 25 years old.
I started it with one other family in 1980.
that's not my thing.
And all of the sudden, it brought a lot of money and a lot of attention.
I don't think --
And I believe in a pluralistic society,
everybody's betting on something.
you know, I had no plans to do what it's doing now.
And then when I wrote this book,
for your own ego, ever.
and the "stewardship of influence."
So I believe, essentially, leadership is stewardship.
That if you are a leader in any area --
For instance, that's why I believe in protecting the environment.
I'm just here for 80 years and then that's it.
and the guy was challenging me and he'd go,
And he said, "No."
Do you believe that as human beings -- I'm not talking about religion --
do you believe that as human beings, it is our responsibility
When he said the word "species," he was revealing his worldview.
Well now, I know a lot of times we act like ducks,
codify it or qualify it or quantify it,
I don't personally have enough faith to be an atheist.
Your worldview, though, does determine everything else in your life,
What we believe, obviously --
and our behavior determines what we become in life.
And I'm going, what do I do with this?
I don't own a guesthouse.
I still drive the same four year-old Ford that I've driven.
We just said, we're not going to use it on us.
I stopped taking a salary from the church that I pastor.
In fact, personally, I've never met
Believe me, there's a whole lot easier ways to make money.
And I'm watching a guy who's lived his life --
And having been through literally hundreds if not thousands of funerals,
it makes a difference.
It makes a difference what you believe.
and then we set up three foundations,
we started tithing.
Now, that's a principle in the Bible
that says give 10 percent of what you get back to charity,
give it away to help other people.
So, we started doing that, and each year we would raise our tithe one percent.
So, our first year of marriage we went to 11 percent,
second year we went to 12 percent,
it breaks the grip of materialism in my life.
it's about being good and doing good.
Giving your life away.
It doesn't come from sex.
It doesn't come from salary.
It comes from serving.
And so we began to give away,
and now after 30 years,
That, actually, was the easy part.
The hard part is, what do I do with all this attention?
Because I started getting all kinds of invitations.
I just came off a nearly month-long speaking tour
on three different continents,
and it's Solomon's prayer for more influence.
When you read this prayer,
He said, "I want you to make me famous.
Until you read the whole psalm, the whole chapter.
support the oppressed, defend the defenseless, care for the sick,
assist the poor, speak up for the foreigner,
those in prison."
I looked at it, and I thought, you know,
It's based on a whole different set of things.
And I had to admit:
I can't think of the last time I thought of widows and orphans.
They're not on my radar.
I pastor a church in one of the most affluent areas of America --
a bunch of gated communities.
I have a church full of CEOs and scientists.
They're just not in my pathway.
Now, they're 13 miles up the road in Santa Ana.
So I had to say, ok,
But Moses, if you saw the movie, "The Ten Commandments,"
Moses goes out, and there's this burning bush, and God talks to him,
And God says, "Throw it down."
And then God says, "Pick it up."
And he picks it back up again,
OK. What's that all about? Well, I do know a couple of things.
It's not just, "Wow, isn't that cool?"
And, by the way, my God doesn't have to show up on cheese bread.
But God -- my God -- doesn't show up on sprinkler images.
But he doesn't do miracles just to show off.
he already knows the answer.
Well, it was a shepherd's staff. Now, follow me on this.
Your assets are tied up in your flocks.
by hook or by crook.
You pull them or you poke them. One or the other.
So, he's saying,
"You're going to lay down your identity.
What's in your hand?"
And he's saying, "If you lay it down, I'll make it come alive.
I'll do some things you could never imagine possible."
And so, I'm talking to the players,
because most of the NBA teams, NFL teams and all the other teams
have done this 40 Days of Purpose, based on the book.
And that basketball represents your identity, who you are:
And it represents your influence.
And even though you're only going to be in the NBA for a few years,
to all of you very bright people at TED --
What do you have that you've been given?
freedom, networks, opportunities,
That, to me, is the primary question about life.
That, to me, is what being purpose-driven is all about.
Ability, Personality and Experiences.
These things shape you.
And I would look at them: "This is not an accident."
And I got joy out of just watching them sleep.
or, you know, confessing or doing something like that.
The bottom line is, God gets pleasure watching you be you.
look at what's in your hand --
your identity, your influence, your income --
It's about making the world a better place."
with all the things that have been talked about the last two days.
So many different points of resonance
that it's going to be difficult to bring them all up,
They've been swept away over the last two decades
by these types of world-flattening digitization technologies, right?
What's happened in the music world is there's a culture,
or an ecosystem that's been created
that, if you take some words from Apple,
the catchphrase -- that we create, rip, mix and burn.
with people continually working to connect musical ideas,
innovate them and keep things constantly up to date.
Today's hit single is not last year's hit single.
I'm here to talk about books.
In particular, textbooks and the kind of educational materials
but what I want to talk about is some of the disconnects
That in fact, the publishing process --
just because of the fact that it's complicated,
it's heavy, books are expensive --
creates a sort of a wall between authors of books
and the ultimate users of books,
be they teachers, students or just general readers.
And this is even more true if you happen to speak a language
other than one of the world's major languages, and especially English.
I'm going to call these people below the barrier "shutouts"
because they're really shut out of the process
of being able to share their knowledge with the world.
Imagine taking all the world's books.
so that people can modify it, play with it, improve it.
so that you can update this content, improve it, play with it,
So that we could truly build an ecosystem with not just authors,
but all the people who could be or want to be authors
in all the different languages of the world,
So, really, this is the dream,
and in a sense what you can think of it
is we're trying to enable anyone in the world,
I mean anyone in the world --
creating educational materials, sharing them with the world,
Over the last six-and-a-half years,
to Nicholas Negroponte's talk yesterday,
Well, the first thing is,
who wanted to share her fantastic music content with the world,
Tremendous use.
In fact, a lot of this use coming from United States K-12 schools,
because anyone who's involved in a school scale back,
the first thing that's cut is the music curriculum.
because of the open, extensible nature of this.
People, volunteers and even companies
that are translating materials into Asian languages
like Chinese, Japanese and Thai,
to spread the knowledge even further.
means building customized books.
Companies like National Instruments,
so that we can go way beyond our regular kind of textbook
And to them, this idea of being able to remix
and customize to the local context is extraordinarily important,
because just providing free content to people
has actually been likened by people in the developing world
to a kind of cultural imperialism --
that if you don't empower people
with the ability to re-contextualize the material,
translate it into their own language and take ownership of it,
it's not good.
people know about UC Merced.
It's a new university in California, in the Central Valley,
working very closely with community colleges.
which is trying to bring Internet connectivity
And we've also been working with a number of other organizations.
who have taken a real leadership role in this area of open content.
This costs -- anybody guess?
How much would it cost in a bookstore?
Why does it cost 22 dollars?
Because it's published on demand
and it's developed from this repository of open materials.
If this book were to be published by a regular publisher,
it would cost at least 122 dollars.
that are modular, that are customized to each individual class
and published on demand very inexpensively,
either pushed out through Amazon
or published directly through an on-demand press, like QOOP.
And I think that this is an extraordinarily interesting area
Books that might sell 100 copies a year, 1,000 copies a year.
And I think one of the things that you should take away from this talk
What's really making all of this happen?
There's tons of technology,
and the only piece of technology that I really want to talk about is XML.
How many people know about XML?
And what you can really think of XML in this case
is it's the packaging that we're putting around these pages.
Remember we took the book, tore the pages out?
XML are the nubs on the Lego
that allow us to combine the content together in a myriad different ways,
and it provides us a framework to share content.
all the pages you've torn out of books,
and create highly sophisticated learning machines:
books, courses, course packs.
so that every student can have a book or a course
It lets you reuse the same materials in multiple different ways,
and surprising new ways.
It lets you interconnect ideas,
indicating how fields relate to each other.
And I'll just give you my personal story.
We came up with this six-and-a-half years ago
I teach signal processing
and my challenge was to show that this math --
that links really cool applications like music synthesizers
to tremendous economic opportunities,
but also governed by intellectual property.
and we needed new tools to be able to interconnect these ideas.
where you can imagine all the books in a library
actually starting to talk to each other.
it's the interconnections between ideas that teaching is really all about.
So imagine your kid's algebra textbook in seventh grade.
You can click on every single equation
and bring up a little tool to be able to experiment with it,
tinker with it, understand it.
Because we really don't understand until we do.
The same type of mark-up, like MathML, for chemistry.
Imagine Music XML
And we would be accused of [piracy] for doing that,
because this music has been propertized.
It's now owned, much of it by big industries.
So, really, the key thing here is we can't let this happen.
We can't let this Napster thing happen here.
And the inspiration here is taken from open-source software.
Things like Linux and the GPL.
At the bottom of every piece of material in Connexions
In fact, you're free to share it, to do all of these things:
to copy it, to change it, even to make commercial use of it,
as long as you attribute the author.
That's why people write, not necessarily making bucks.
We're not talking about Harry Potter, right?
We're at the long tail end here.
And there's actually a tremendous uptake
to make it free for people who do this whole idea of re-sampling,
ripping, mixing, burning and sharing.
which is actually a pretty good module.
and when you go to the supposed course website,
it points to a lingerie-selling website.
So this is a little bit of a problem.
So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control
and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in.
You come to TED. Why do you come to TED?
Because Chris and his team have ensured
that things are very, very high quality, right?
And so we need to be able to do the same thing.
so that they can focus on the content in the repository
that they think is really important.
And you can think of TED as a potential lens.
you can really view this as a call to action.
Connexions and open content is all about sharing knowledge.
because I think together we can truly change the landscape
of education and educational publishing.
This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students,
And in the seat next to me was a high school student, a teenager,
and she came from a really poor family.
And she wanted to make something of her life,
and pass it on to kids?
and I'm going to tell you what really leads to success
and makes TEDsters tick.
if you do it for love, the money comes anyway.
I figured, they're not workaholics. They're workafrolics.
"I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing."
I wasn't good enough; I wasn't smart enough.
I didn't think I'd make it."
Frank Gehry said to me,
"My mother pushed me."
The first thing I say is:
founding the first micro-computer software company."
I'd say it was a pretty good idea.
And there's no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas --
it's just doing some very simple things.
And I give lots of evidence.
Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED.
A fact
came out of MIT,
couple of years ago. Ken Hale,
who's a linguist,
said that of the 6,000 languages
spoken on Earth right now,
3,000 aren't spoken by the children.
So that in one generation,
we're going to halve our cultural diversity.
He went on to say
that every two weeks,
an elder goes to the grave
carrying the last spoken word
of that culture.
So an entire philosophy,
a body of knowledge about the natural world
that had been empirically gleaned over centuries,
goes away.
And this happens every two weeks.
since my dental experience,
I have been traveling the world
and coming back
with stories about some of these people.
What I'd like to do right now
is share some of those stories with you.
This is Tamdin.
She is a 69-year-old nun.
She was thrown in prison in Tibet for two years
for putting up a little tiny placard
protesting the occupation of her country.
And when I met her, she had just
taken a walk over the Himalayas
from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet,
into Nepal, across to India --
30 days --
to meet her leader, the Dalai Lama.
The Dalai Lama lives in Dharamsala, India.
So I took this picture three days
after she arrived,
and she had this beat-up pair of tennis shoes on,
with her toes sticking out.
And she crossed in March,
and there's a lot of snow at 18,500 feet in March.
Paldin is a 62-year-old monk.
And he spent 33 years in prison.
His whole monastery was thrown into prison
at the time of the uprising,
when the Dalai Lama had to leave
Tibet.
And
he was beaten, starved,
tortured -- lost all his teeth while in prison.
And when I met him, he was a kind gentle old man.
And it really impressed me --
I met him two weeks after he got out of prison --
that he went through that experience, and ended up
with the demeanor that he had.
and I'd spent about five weeks there,
and I was hearing these similar stories
of these refugees that had poured out of Tibet
into Dharamsala.
And it just so happened, on the fifth week,
there was a public teaching by the Dalai Lama.
And
I was watching this crowd of monks and nuns,
many of which I had just interviewed,
and heard their stories,
and I watched their faces,
and they gave us a little FM radio,
and we could listen to the translation of his teachings.
And what he said was:
treat your enemies as if they were precious jewels,
because it's your enemies
that build your tolerance and patience
on the road to your enlightenment.
That hit me so hard,
telling these people that had been through this experience.
Tibet, and I started
interviewing the people there, taking my photographs. That's what I do.
I interview and do portraits.
And this is a little girl.
I took her portrait up on top of the Jokhang Temple.
And I'd snuck in --
because it's totally illegal to have a picture of the Dalai Lama in Tibet --
it's the quickest way you can get arrested.
So I snuck in a bunch of little wallet-sized pictures of the Dalai Lama,
and I would hand them out.
And when I gave them to the people,
they'd either hold them to their heart,
or they'd hold them up to their head and just stay there.
And this is --
well, at the time -- I did this 10 years ago --
that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left.
I was going in, interviewing these people and doing their portraits.
This is Jigme and her sister, Sonam.
And they live up on the Chang Tang, the Tibetan Plateau,
way in the western part of the country.
This is at 17,000 feet.
And they had just come down from the high pastures,
at 18,000 feet.
Same thing: gave her a picture,
she held it up to her forehead.
And I usually hand out Polaroids
when I do these, because I'm setting up lights,
and checking my lights,
and when I showed her her Polaroid, she screamed and ran into her tent.
he was found to be the Buddha of Compassion at the age of two,
out in a peasant's house,
way out in the middle of nowhere.
At the age of four, he was installed
as the 14th Dalai Lama.
As a teenager, he faced
the invasion of his country,
and had to deal with it -- he was the leader of the country.
Eight years later, when they discovered there was a plot
to kill him,
they dressed him up like a beggar
and snuck him out of the country on horseback,
and took the same trip that Tamdin did.
And he's never been back to his country since.
And
if you think about this man,
46 years later,
still sticking
to this non-violent response
to a severe political and human rights issue.
And the young people,
young Tibetans, are starting to say, listen, this doesn't work.
You know, violence as a political tool
is all the rage right now.
And
he still is holding this line.
So this is our icon
to non-violence in our world --
one of our living icons.
This is Moi. This is in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
And Moi is 35 years old.
And
this area of the Ecuadorian Amazon --
oil was discovered in 1972.
And in this period of time -- since that time --
as much oil, or twice as much oil
as was spilled in the Exxon Valdez accident,
was spilled in this little area of the Amazon,
and the tribes in this area have constantly had to move.
And Moi
belongs to the Huaorani tribe,
and they're known as
very fierce, they're known as "auca."
And they've managed to keep out
the seismologists and the oil workers
with spears and blowguns.
And we spent --
I was with a team --
two weeks with these guys out in the jungle
watching them hunt.
This was on a monkey hunt,
hunting with curare-tipped darts.
And the knowledge that these people have
about the natural environment is incredible.
They could hear things, smell things, see things I couldn't see.
And I couldn't even see the monkeys
that they were
getting with these darts.
and Yadira is
five years old. She's in a
tribe that's neighboring the Huaorani.
And her tribe has had to move
three times in the last 10 years because of the oil spills.
And we never hear about that. And the latest
infraction against these people is,
as part of Plan Colombia,
we're spraying Paraquat or Round Up, whatever it is --
we're defoliating thousands of acres
of the Ecuadorian Amazon
in our war on drugs.
And these people are the people who take the brunt of it.
He's the shaman of the Huaorani,
and
he said to us, you know, I'm an older man now;
I'm getting tired, you know; I'm tired
of spearing these oil workers.
I wish they would just go away.
And I was -- I usually travel alone
when I do my work, but I did this --
I hosted a program for Discovery,
and when I went down with the team,
I was quite concerned about
going in with a whole bunch of people, especially into the Huaorani,
deep into the Huaorani tribe.
And
as it turned out, these guys really
taught me a thing or two about blending in
with the locals.
(Laughter)
just before 9/11 --
August of 2001 --
I took my son, Dax,
who was 16 at the time,
and I took him to Pakistan.
Because at first I wanted --
you know, I've taken him on a couple of trips,
but I wanted him to see
people that live on a dollar a day or less.
I wanted him to get an experience
in the Islamic world
and I also wanted him to --
I was going there to work with a group,
do a story on a group called the Kalash,
that are a group of animists, 3,000 animists,
that live -- very small area --
surrounded by Islam -- there's 3,000
of these Kalash left; they're incredible people.
So it was a great experience for him. He stayed up all night with them,
drumming and dancing.
And he brought a soccer ball,
and we had soccer every night in this little village.
and met their shaman.
By the way, Mengatoue was the shaman
of his tribe as well.
And this is John Doolikahn,
who's the shaman of the Kalash.
And he's up in the mountains,
right on the border with Afghanistan.
In fact, on that other side is the area, Tora Bora,
the area where
Osama bin Laden's supposed to be. This is the tribal area.
And we watched
and stayed with
John Doolikahn.
And the shaman -- I did a whole series on shamanism,
which is
an interesting phenomenon.
But around the world,
they go into trance in different ways,
and in Pakistan,
the way they do it is they burn juniper leaves
and they sacrifice an animal,
pour the blood of the animal on the leaves
and then inhale the smoke.
And they're all praying
to the mountain gods
as they go into trance.
getting kids used to different realities,
I think, is so important. What Dan Dennett said the other day --
having a curriculum where they study different religions,
just to make a mental flexibility,
give them a mental flexibility
in different belief systems --
I think this is so necessary in our world today
as you see these clash of beliefs taking place.
And all the security issues they cause us.
So, one thing we did five years ago:
we started a program that links kids
in indigenous communities with kids in the United States.
So we first hooked up
a spot in the Navajo Nation with a classroom in Seattle.
We now have 15 sites.
We have one in Kathmandu, Nepal;
Dharamsala, India; Takaungu, Kenya --
Takaungu is one-third Christian, one-third Muslim
and one-third animist, the community is --
Ollantaytambo, Peru,
and Arctic Village, Alaska.
in Arctic Village, Alaska.
He lives in this log cabin --
no running water, no heat other than --
no windows
and high-speed Internet connection.
And this is --
I see this rolling out all over --
this is our site in Ollantaytambo, Peru, four years ago,
where they first saw their first computers;
now they have computers in their classrooms.
And the way we've done this --
we teach digital storytelling to these kids.
And we have them tell stories about issues in their community
in their community that they care about.
And this is in Peru, where the kids told the story
about a river that they cleaned up.
And the way we do it is, we do it in workshops,
and we bring people who want to learn
digital workflow and storytelling,
and have them
work with the kids.
And just this last year we've taken a group of teenagers in,
and this has worked the best.
So our dream is to bring teenagers together,
so they'll have a community service experience
as well as a cross-cultural experience,
as they teach kids in these areas
and help them build their communication infrastructure.
in the Tibetan children's village in Dharamsala.
We have the website, where the kids all get their homepage.
This is all their movies. We've got about 60 movies
that these kids have made,
and they're quite incredible.
The one I want to show you --
after we get them to make the movies,
we have a night where we show the movies to the community.
And this is in Takaungu --
we've got a generator and a digital projector,
and we're projecting it up against a barn,
and showing one of the movies that they made.
And if you get a chance, you can go to our website, and you'll see
the incredible work these kids do.
I wanted to give indigenous people a voice.
That was one of the big motivating factors.
But the other motivating factor is
the insular nature of our country.
National Geographic just did a Roper Study
of 18 to 26 year olds
in our country
and in nine other industrialized countries.
It was a two million dollar study.
United States came in second to last
in geographic knowledge.
70 percent of the kids couldn't find
Afghanistan or Iraq on a map;
60 percent couldn't find India;
30 percent couldn't find the Pacific Ocean.
And this is a study
that was just done a couple of years ago.
in the couple of minutes I have left,
is a film that a student made in Guatemala.
We just had a workshop in Guatemala.
A week before we got to the workshop,
a massive landslide, caused by Hurricane Stan,
last October, came in and buried
600 people alive in their village.
And this kid lived in the village --
he wasn't there at the time --
and this is the little movie he put together about that.
And he hadn't seen a computer before
we did this movie. We taught him Photoshop and --
yeah, we can play it.
that he got from his grandfather.
(Applause)
I love trees, and I'm very lucky,
because we live near a wonderful arboretum,
and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife
and now, with my four-year-old,
and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.
The second school I was at had big trees too,
had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,
and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation
around it, around the playing fields.
and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;
I was abused; and this came out of the blue.
Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --
well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;
I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.
And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,
next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,
and we were on a human rights tour,
and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,
and, from my very privileged position,
this was the only reference point that I had.
And it was an amazing learning experience
because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,
you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,
it was something that happened to other people over there.
he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --
you know, just after I'd done the Biko song,
we're going to do a tour for Amnesty,
you have to be on it, and really that was the first time
that I'd been out and started meeting people
who'd watched their family being shot in front of them,
who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,
and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,
and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.
and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.
I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,
Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,
and it was an amazing experience.
And, once again, I got an extraordinary education,
and it was the first time, really,
that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,
and these human rights stories became very physical,
and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.
was that you could suffer in this way
and then have your whole experience, your story, denied,
buried and forgotten.
And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,
or a video or film camera,
it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours
and there was a decision then --
well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,
about trying to set up a division
that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.
It didn't really get anywhere,
and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,
OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,
or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,
then you can actually start doing something,
and campaigning, and being heard,
and telling people about what's going on.
and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.
And we campaign with activist groups
and help them tell their story and, in fact,
I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,
and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,
and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,
this one isn't quite so good.
In the north of Uganda,
there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,
people who are not refugees in another country,
but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,
they have nowhere to live.
And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,
and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the --
now, what's it called?
I forget the name of the of the army --
it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe --
but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,
so if we could run the first video.
Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.
We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...
still exists back home.
Text: "Between Two Fires: Torture and Displacement in Northern Uganda"
Man: When we were at home, it was Kony's [rebel] soldiers disturbing us.
At first, we were safe in the camp.
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.
Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.
Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.
The other soldier also came.
Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.
The other one carried Evelyn aside.
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.
Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.
They kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.
Woman: They insisted that I was lying.
At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.
I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.
Text: Uganda ratified the Convention Against Torture in 1986.
Torture is defined as any act by which severe pain of suffering,
whether physical or mental,
is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity
to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.
In my country, it was --
we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;
we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.
I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,
and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,
he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest,
that he was interrogated and tortured
and returned to the street four weeks later,
because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern,
and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,
and that may or may not be true --
I didn't think he was a liar, though.
as well as the polar ice caps melting,
human rights, which have been fought for,
for many hundreds of years in some cases,
are, also, eroding very fast,
and that is something that we need to take a look at
and, maybe, start campaigning for.
I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones
and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed,
with their footage in California
to change the youth correction systems employed,
and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods
are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,
and that's questionable to start off.
And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,
excuse me, Mr. Gabriel,
would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?
No, not at all, no problem, take your time.
But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,
this is cruel and unusual punishment.
who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,
and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.
Text: You can say a jury is corrupt.
You can say a person is lying.
You can say you don't trust newspapers.
But you can't say
what you just saw
never happened.
Help WITNESS give cameras to the world.
Shoot a video;
expose injustice;
reveal the truth;
show us what's wrong with the world;
and maybe
we can help
make it
right.
WITNESS.
All the video you have just seen was recorded by
human rights groups working with WITNESS.
in a sense the small, portable, DV cam
was really what allowed it to come into being.
And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,
so that groups can communicate much more effectively,
campaign much more effectively,
but now we have the wonderful possibility,
which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,
because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast
all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us.
in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort
has a chance of getting their story uploaded,
being seen, being watched,
that they really know that they can be heard,
that there would be a giant website,
maybe, a little like Google Earth,
and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,
for the world's inhabitants. In a way
what this technology is allowing is, really,
that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,
that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS
or who's being beaten up, for the first time,
and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture --
if we can move that into these sort of fields,
I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.
There could be a new movement growing up,
rising from the ground, reaching for the light,
and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.
Hello. Actually, that's "hello" in Bauer Bodoni
for the typographically hysterical amongst us.
One of the threads that seems to have come through
loud and clear in the last couple of days
is this need to reconcile what the Big wants --
the "Big" being the organization, the system, the country --
and what the "Small" wants -- the individual, the person.
And how do you bring those two things together?
Charlie Ledbetter, yesterday, I thought, talked very articulately
about this need to bring consumers, to bring people
into the process of creating things.
And that's what I want to talk about today.
So, bringing together the Small to help facilitate and create the Big,
I think, is something that we believe in -- something I believe in,
and something that we kind of bring to life
through what we do at Ideo.
the "Blinding Glimpse of the Bleeding Obvious."
Often, the good ideas are so staring-at-you-right-in-the-face
that you kind of miss them. And I think, a lot of times,
what we do is just, sort of, hold the mirror up to our clients, and sort of go,
"Duh! You know, look what's really going on."
And rather than talk about it in the theory,
I think I'm just going to show you an example.
We were asked by a large healthcare system in Minnesota
to describe to them what their patient experience was.
And I think they were expecting --
they'd worked with lots of consultants before --
I think they were expecting some kind of hideous org chart
with thousands of bubbles and systemic this, that and the other,
and all kinds of mappy stuff.
Or even worse, some kind of ghastly death-by-Powerpoint thing
with WowCharts and all kinds of, you know, God knows, whatever.
I'll play this until your eyeballs completely dissolve.
This is 59 seconds into the film.
This is a minute 59.
3:19.
I think something happens. I think a head may appear in a second.
5:10.
5:58.
6:20.
We showed them the whole cut,
and they were all completely, what is this?
And the point is when you lie in a hospital bed all day,
all you do is look at the roof, and it's a really shitty experience.
And just putting yourself in the position of the patient --
He just lay in the hospital bed,
and, kind of, stared at the polystyrene ceiling tiles
for a really long time.
That's what it's like to be a patient in the hospital.
And they were sort, you know, blinding glimpse of bleeding obvious.
Oh, my goodness. So, looking at the situation
from the point of view of the person out --
as opposed to the traditional position of the organization in --
was, for these guys, quite a revelation.
And so, that was a really catalytic thing for them.
So they snapped into action.
They said, OK, it's not about systemic change.
It's not about huge, ridiculous things that we need to do.
It's about tiny things that can make a huge amount of difference.
that we could do to have a huge amount of impact.
The first thing we did was we took a little bicycle mirror
and we Band-Aided it here, onto a gurney, a hospital trolley,
so that when you were wheeled around by a nurse or by a doctor,
you could actually have a conversation with them.
You could, kind of, see them in your rear-view mirror,
so it created a tiny human interaction.
Very small example of something that they could do.
Interestingly, the nurses themselves, sort of, snapped into action --
said, OK, we embrace this. What can we do?
The first thing they do is they decorated the ceiling.
Which I thought was really -- I showed this to my mother recently.
I think my mother now thinks that I'm some sort of interior decorator.
It's what I do for a living, sort of Laurence Llewelyn-Bowen.
Not particularly the world's best design solution
for those of us who are real, sort of, hard-core designers,
but nonetheless, a fabulous empathic solution for people.
Things that they started doing themselves --
like changing the floor going into the patient's room
so that it signified, "This is my room. This is my personal space" --
was a really interesting sort of design solution to the problem.
And another idea, again, that came from one of the nurses -- which I love --
was they took traditional, sort of, corporate white boards,
then they put them on one wall of the patient's room,
and they put this sticker there.
So that what you could actually do was go into the room
and write messages to the person who was sick in that room,
which was lovely.
So, tiny, tiny, tiny solutions that made a huge amount of impact.
I thought that was a really, really nice example.
kind of, seeing opportunities in things that are around you
and snapping and turning them into a solution.
It's a history of invention based around this.
I'm going to read this because I want to get these names right.
Joan Ganz Cooney saw her daughter -- came down on a Saturday morning,
saw her daughter watching the test card,
waiting for programs to come on one morning
and from that came Sesame Street.
Malcolm McLean was moving from one country to another
and was wondering why it took these guys so long
to get the boxes onto the ship.
And he invented the shipping container.
George de Mestral -- this is not bugs all over a Birkenstock --
was walking his dog in a field and got covered in burrs,
sort of little prickly things, and from that came Velcro.
saw the cat's eyes at the side of the road,
when he was driving home one night and from that came the Catseye.
So there's a whole series of just using your eyes,
seeing things for the first time, seeing things afresh
and using them as an opportunity to create new possibilities.
Second one, without sounding overly Zen,
and this is a quote from the Buddha:
"Finding yourself in the margins, looking to the edges of things,
is often a really interesting place to start."
Blinkered vision tends to produce, I think, blinkered solutions.
So, looking wide, using your peripheral vision,
is a really interesting place to look for opportunity.
We were asked by a device producer --
we did the Palm Pilot and the Treo.
We did a lot of sexy tech at Ideo --
they'd seen this and they wanted a sexy piece of technology
for medical diagnostics.
This was a device that a nurse uses
when they're doing a spinal procedure in hospital.
They'll ask the nurses to input data.
And they had this vision of the nurse, kind of, clicking away
on this aluminum device
and it all being incredibly, sort of, gadget-lustish.
When we actually went and watched this procedure taking place --
and I'll explain this in a second --
it became very obvious that there was a human dimension to this
that they really weren't recognizing.
When you're having a four-inch needle inserted into your spine --
which was the procedure that this device's data was about;
it was for pain management -- you're shit scared; you're freaking out.
And so the first thing that pretty much every nurse did,
was hold the patient's hand to comfort them. Human gesture --
which made the fabulous two-handed data input completely impossible.
but much more human and practical, was this.
So, it's not a Palm Pilot by any stretch of the imagination,
but it has a thumb-scroll so you can do everything with one hand.
So, again, going back to this -- the idea that a tiny human gesture
dictated the design of this product.
And I think that's really, really important.
So, again, this idea of workarounds.
We use this phrase "workarounds" a lot,
sort of, looking around us. I was actually looking around the TED
and just watching all of these kind of things happen
while I've been here.
This idea of the way that people cobble together solutions in our life --
and the things we kind of do in our environment
that are somewhat subconscious but have huge potential --
is something that we look at a lot.
called "Thoughtless Acts?"
It's been all about these kind of thoughtless things that people do,
which have huge intention and huge opportunity.
Why do we all follow the line in the street?
This is a picture in a Japanese subway.
People consciously follow things even though, why, we don't know.
Why do we line up the square milk carton with the square fence?
Because we kind of have to -- we're just compelled to.
We don't know why, but we do.
Why do we wrap the teabag string around the cup handle?
Again, we're sort of using the world around us
to create our own design solutions.
And we're always saying to our clients: "You should look at this stuff.
This stuff is really important. This stuff is really vital."
This is people designing their own experiences.
You can draw from this.
We sort of assume that because there's a pole in the street,
that it's okay to use it, so we park our shopping cart there.
It's there for our use, on some level.
to do all these different things.
We co-opt other experiences --
we take one item and transfer it to another.
And this is my favorite one. My mother used to say to me,
"Just because your sister jumps in the lake doesn't mean you have to."
But, of course, we all do. We all follow each other every day.
So somebody assumes
that because somebody else has done something,
that's permission for them to do the same thing.
And there's almost this sort of semaphore around us all the time.
I mean, shopping bag equals "parking meter out of order."
And we all, kind of, know how to read these signals now.
We all talk to one another in this highly visual way
without realizing what we're doing.
Third section is this idea of not knowing,
of consciously putting yourself backwards.
I talk about unthinking situations all the time.
Sort of having beginner's mind, scraping your mind clean
and looking at things afresh.
and he was asked by his boss
to help design a storage system for children.
This is the Billy bookcase -- it's IKEA's biggest selling product.
Hammer it together. Hammer it together with a shoe, if you're me,
because they're impossible to assemble.
But big selling bookcase. How do we replicate this for children?
The reality is when you actually watch children,
children don't think about things like storage in linear terms.
Children assume permission in a very different way.
Children live on things. They live under things.
They live around things,
and so their spatial awareness relationship,
and their thinking around storage is totally different.
So the first thing you have to do -- this is Graham, the designer --
is, sort of, put yourself in their shoes. And so, here he is
sitting under the table.
So, what came out of this?
This is the storage system that he designed.
So what is this? I hear you all ask. No, I don't.
So, you know, it's a totally different way of looking at the situation.
It's a completely empathic solution --
apart from the fact that teddy's probably not loving it.
and I think that's one of the things.
And putting yourself in the position of the person,
and I think that's one of the threads that I've heard again
from this conference is how do we put ourselves
in other peoples' shoes and really feel what they feel?
And then use that information to fuel solutions?
And I think that's what this is very much about.
Last section: green armband. We've all got them.
It's about this really.
I mean, it's about picking battles big enough to matter
but small enough to win.
Again, that's one of the themes
that I think has come through loud and clear in this conference
is: Where do we start? How do we start? What do we do to start?
So, again, we were asked to design a water pump
for a company called ApproTEC, in Kenya.
They're now called KickStart.
we wanted to make this thing incredibly beautiful
and spend a lot of time thinking of the form.
And that was completely irrelevant.
When you put yourself in the position of these people,
things like the fact that this has to be able to fold up
and fit on a bicycle, become much more relevant
than the form of it. The way it's produced,
it has to be produced with indigenous manufacturing methods
and indigenous materials.
So it had to be looked at completely from the point of view of the user.
We had to completely transfer ourselves over to their world.
So what seems like a very clunky product
is, in fact, incredibly useful.
It's powered a bit like a Stairmaster -- you pump up and down on it.
Children can use it. Adults can use it. Everybody uses it.
It's turning these guys -- again, one of the themes --
it's turning them into entrepreneurs.
And for us, it's been great
because it's won loads of design awards.
So we actually managed to reconcile the needs of the design company,
the needs of the individuals in the company,
to feel good about a product we were actually designing,
and the needs of the individuals we were designing it for.
There it is, pumping water from 30 feet.
So as a final gesture we handed out these bracelets
to all of you this morning.
We've made a donation on everybody's behalf here
to kick start, no pun intended, their next project.
Because, again, I think, sort of, putting our money where our mouth is, here.
We feel that this is an important gesture.
So we've handed out bracelets. Small is the new big.
I hope you'll all wear them.
So that's it. Thank you.
I've been at MIT for 44 years.
I went to TED I.
All the other TEDs --
and I went to them all, under Ricky's regime --
I talked about what the Media Lab was doing,
which today has almost 500 people in it.
last week it actually said I quit the Media Lab.
I didn't quit the Media Lab, I stepped down as chairman --
which was a kind of ridiculous title, but someone else has taken it on --
and one of the things you can do as a professor
is you stay on as a professor.
And I will now do for the rest of my life the One Laptop Per Child,
which I've sort of been doing for a year and a half, anyway.
So I'm going to tell you about this,
use my 18 minutes to tell you why we're doing it,
how we're doing it and then what we're doing.
And at some point I'll even pass around
what the $100 laptop might be like.
and so I figured I'd start with the three that at least drove me to do this.
And the first is pretty obvious.
It's amazing when you meet a head of state, and you say,
"What is your most precious natural resource?"
They will not say "children" at first,
and then when you say, "children," they will pretty quickly agree with you.
And so that isn't very hard.
they include education, sometimes can be just education
and can never be without some element of education.
So that's certainly part of it.
And that is that we all in this room learned how to walk, how to talk,
not by being taught how to talk, or taught how to walk,
but by interacting with the world,
by having certain results as a consequence of being able to ask for something,
or being able to stand up and reach it.
Whereas at about the age six, we were told to stop learning that way,
and that all learning from then on would happen through teaching,
whether it's people standing up, like I'm doing now,
or a book, or something.
But it was really through teaching.
And one of the things in general that computers have provided to learning
is that it now includes a kind of learning
which is a little bit more like walking and talking,
in the sense that a lot of it is driven by the learner himself or herself.
some of you may know Seymour Papert.
This is back in 1982, when we were working in Senegal.
Because some people think that the $100 laptop just happened a year ago,
or two years ago, or we were struck by lightning --
this actually has gone back a long time, and in fact, back to the '60s.
Here we're in the '80s.
Steve Jobs had given us some laptops. We were in Senegal.
It didn't scale
but it at least was bringing computers to developing countries
and learning pretty quickly that these kids,
even though English wasn't their language,
the Latin alphabet barely was their language,
but they could just swim like fish.
They could play these like pianos.
And these are two anecdotes --
one was in Cambodia,
in a village that has no electricity, no water, no television, no telephone,
but has broadband Internet now.
And these kids, their first English word is "Google"
and they only know Skype.
They've never heard of telephony.
They just use Skype.
And they go home at night --
they've got a broadband connection in a hut that doesn't have electricity.
The parents love it, because when they open up the laptops,
it's the brightest light source in the house.
And talk about where metaphors and reality mix --
this is the actual school.
to legislate one laptop per child in the year 2002.
Now at the time, I think it's fair to say that 80 percent of the teachers were --
let me say, apprehensive.
Really, they were actually against it.
And they really preferred that the money would be used
for higher salaries, more schools, whatever.
They're reporting five things: drop of truancy to almost zero,
attending parent-teacher meetings --
which nobody did and now almost everybody does --
drop in discipline problems, increase in student participation.
Teachers are now saying it's kind of fun to teach.
Kids are engaged -- they have laptops! --
is that the servers have to be turned off at certain times at night
because the teachers are getting too much email
from the kids asking them for help.
So when you see that kind of thing --
this is not something that you have to test.
The days of pilot projects are over, when people say,
"We'd like to do three or four thousand in our country to see how it works."
Screw you. Go to the back of the line and someone else will do it,
and then when you figure out that this works, you can join as well.
And this is what we're doing.
It's a nonprofit association.
It raised about 20 million dollars
to do the engineering to just get this built,
and then have it produced afterwards.
Scale is truly important.
And it's not important because you can buy components at a lower price, OK?
It's because you can go to a manufacturer --
and I will leave the name out --
but we wanted a small display,
doesn't have to have perfect color uniformity.
It can even have a pixel or two missing.
It doesn't have to be that bright.
And this particular manufacturer said,
"We're not interested in that. We're interested in the living room.
We're interested in perfect color uniformity.
We're interested in big displays, bright displays.
You're not part of our strategic plan."
And I said, "That's kind of too bad, because we need 100 million units a year."
And that's why scale counts.
And that's why we will not launch this
without five to 10 million units in the first run.
And the idea is to launch with enough scale
that the scale itself helps bring the price down,
and that's why I said seven to 10 million there.
And we're doing it without a sales-and-marketing team.
I mean, you're looking at the sales-and-marketing team.
We will do it by going to seven large countries
and getting them to agree and launch it,
and then the others can follow.
We have partners.
It's not hard to guess Google would be one.
The others are all playing to pending.
And this has been in the press a great deal.
It's the so-called Green Machine that we introduced with Kofi Annan
in November at the World Summit that was held in Tunisia.
Well, no, it's not a laptop project. It's an education project.
And the fun part -- and I'm quite focused on it --
I tell people I used to be a light bulb, but now I'm a laser --
I'm just going to get that thing built, and it turns out it's not so hard.
Because laptop economics are the following:
I say 50 percent here -- it's more like 60,
60 percent of the cost of your laptop
is sales, marketing, distribution and profit.
Now we have none of those, OK?
None of those figure into our cost,
because first of all, we sell it at cost, and the governments distribute it.
It gets distributed to the school system like a textbook.
So that piece disappears.
Then you have display and everything else.
Now the display on your laptop costs,
in rough numbers, 10 dollars a diagonal inch.
That can drop to eight; it can drop to seven
but it's not going to drop to two, or to one and a half,
unless we do some pretty clever things.
It's the rest -- that little brown box -- that is pretty fascinating,
because the rest of your laptop is devoted to itself.
It's a little bit like an obese person
having to use most of their energy to move their obesity.
I've been using laptops since their inception.
And my laptop runs slower, less reliably and less pleasantly
than it ever has before.
And this year is worse.
and I say, "What the hell's wrong with you? Why are we all sitting there?"
And somebody -- to remain nameless -- called our laptop a "gadget" recently.
And I said, "God, our laptop's going to go like a bat out of hell.
When you open it up, it's going to go 'bing.'"
It'll be on.
It'll be just like it was in 1985,
when you bought an Apple Macintosh 512.
It worked really well.
And we've been going steadily downhill.
That's what it is.
The two pieces that are probably notable: it'll be a mesh network,
so when the kids open up their laptops, they all become a network,
and then just need one or two points of backhaul.
You can serve a couple of thousand kids with two megabits.
So you really can bring into a village,
and then the villages can connect themselves,
and you really can do it quite well.
the idea is to have a display that both works outdoors --
isn't it fun using your cell phone outdoors in the sunlight?
Well, you can't see it.
And one of the reasons you can't see it
is because it's backlighting most of the time, most cell phones.
Now, what we're doing is, we're doing one that will be both frontlit and backlit.
And whether you manually switch it or you do it in the software
is to be seen.
But when it's backlit, it's color.
And when it's frontlit, it's black and white
at three times the resolution.
That's why a lot of our people are more or less living in Taiwan right now.
And in about 30 days, we'll know for sure whether this works.
Probably the most important piece there
is that the kids really can do the maintenance.
And this is again something that people don't believe,
but I really think it's quite true.
That's the machine we showed in Tunis.
This is more the direction that we're going to go.
And it's something that we didn't think was possible.
Now, I'm going to pass this around.
This isn't a design, OK?
So this is just a mechanical engineering sort of embodiment of it
for you to play with.
And it's clearly just a model.
The working one is at MIT.
I'm going to pass it to this handsome gentleman.
At least you can decide whether it goes left or --
but that it could transform into an electronic book.
So it's sort of an electronic book.
This is where when you go outside, it's in black and white.
The games buttons are missing,
but it'll also be a games machine,
book machine.
Set it up this way, and it's a television set.
Etc., etc. -- is that enough for simulcast? OK, sorry.
I'll let Jim decide which way to send it afterwards.
OK. Seven countries.
By law you've got to bid, and so on and so forth.
So I can't quite name them.
In the other cases, they don't have to do bids.
They can decide --
it's the federal government in each case.
It's kind of agonizing,
because a lot of people say, "Let's do it at the state level,"
because states are more nimble than the feds, just because of size.
And yet we count.
We're really dealing with the federal government.
We're really dealing with ministries of education.
And if you look at governments around the world,
ministries of education tend to be the most conservative,
and also the ones that have huge payrolls.
Everybody thinks they know about education,
a lot of culture is built into it as well.
It's really hard. And so it's certainly the hard road.
If you look at the countries, they're pretty geoculturally distributed.
Probably Thailand, Brazil and Nigeria
are the three that are the most active and most agreed.
We're purposely not signing anything with anybody
until we actually have the working ones.
And since I visit each one of those countries
within at least every three months,
I'm just going around the world every three weeks.
Here's sort of the schedule
and I put at the bottom we might give some away free in two years at this meeting.
Everybody says it's a $100 laptop --
you can't do it.
Well, guess what, we're not.
We're coming in probably at 135, to start, then drift down.
And that's very important,
because so many things hit the market at a price and then drift up.
It's kind of the loss leader,
and then as soon as it looks interesting,
it can't be afforded, or it can't be scaled out.
So we're targeting 50 dollars in 2010.
And one of the ways -- just one --
but one of the ways to help in the case of the gray market
is to make something that is so utterly unique --
It's a little bit like the fact that automobiles --
thousands of automobiles are stolen every day in the United States.
Not one single post-office truck is stolen.
Because there's no market for post-office trucks.
It looks like a post-office truck.
You can spray paint it. You can do anything you want.
I just learned recently: in South Africa, no white Volvos are stolen.
Period. None. Zero.
So we want to make it very much like a white Volvo.
This perhaps is less interesting,
but we're trying to get the governments to all work together
and it's not easy.
The economics of this is to start with the federal governments
and then later, to subsequently go to other --
whether it's child-to-child funding,
so a child in this country buys one for a child in the developing world,
maybe of the same gender, maybe of the same age.
An uncle gives a niece or a nephew that as a birthday present.
I mean, there are all sorts of things that will happen,
and they'll be very, very exciting.
Are we providing the software?
The answer is:
The system certainly has software,
but no, we're not providing the education content.
That is really done in the countries.
But we are certainly constructionists.
And we certainly believe in learning by doing
and everything from Logo, which was started in 1968,
to more modern things, like Scratch, if you've ever even heard of it,
are very, very much part of it.
And that's the rollout.
It actually is real.
The only criticism, and people really don't want to criticize this,
because it is a humanitarian effort, a nonprofit effort
and to criticize it is a little bit stupid, actually.
"Great idea, but these guys can't do it."
And that could either mean these guys, professors and so on couldn't do it,
or that it's not possible.
Well, on December 12, a company called Quanta agreed to build it,
and since they make about one-third of all the laptops on the planet today,
that question disappeared.
So it's not a matter of whether it's going to happen.
It is going to happen.
And if it comes out at 138 dollars, so what?
If it comes out six months late, so what?
That's a pretty soft landing.
I'm Michael Shermer, director of the Skeptics Society,
publisher of "Skeptic" magazine.
We investigate claims of the paranormal,
voodoo science, pathological science, bad science, non-science,
and plain old non-sense.
And unless you've been on Mars recently,
you know there's a lot of that out there.
But let's face it, there's a lot of bunk.
We are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there --
well, we're sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas,
I brought this with me,
this was given to us by NBC Dateline to test.
It's produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia.
It's called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod.
It's a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it.
You could dowse for all sorts of things,
but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana
in students' lockers.
and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker,
and then you open the locker.
So it looks something like this.
I'll show you.
Well, this is science, so we'll do a controlled experiment.
It'll go this way for sure.
And the answer is, if you open enough of them, yes.
And that's probably the key lesson to my short talk here:
This is how psychics work, astrologers, tarot card readers and so on.
People remember the hits and forget the misses.
In science, we keep the whole database,
and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out
from the total number you'd expect by chance.
one with government-approved THC marijuana, and one with nothing.
And it got it 50 percent of the time --
So that's just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do.
but in fact, people, it turns out, are getting smarter.
Three IQ points per 10 years, going up.
Sort of an interesting thing.
Are science and religion compatible?
It's like, are science and plumbing compatible?
They're just two different things.
Science is not a thing. It's a verb.
It's a way of thinking about things.
It's a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena.
that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings
travel across vast distances of interstellar space
to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob's field in Puckerbrush, Kansas
to promote skeptic.com, our web page?
Or is it more likely that a reader of "Skeptic" did this with Photoshop?
Before we say something is out of this world,
we should first make sure that it's not in this world.
What's more likely:
that Arnold had extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship,
or that the "World Weekly News" makes stuff up?
For those of you in the back, it says here: "Then a miracle occurs.
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two."
This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments.
There's nothing more to it than that.
it's just that it doesn't explain anything or offer anything.
There's nothing to test.
dark energy or dark matter, something like that --
until we figure out what it is, we'll call it this.
It's the beginning of the causal chain for science.
For intelligent design creationists, it's the end of the chain.
So again, we can ask this: what's more likely?
Are UFOs alien spaceships, or perceptual cognitive mistakes, or even fakes?
looking down over Pasadena.
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap, it's because it is.
You don't even need Photoshop or high-tech equipment,
you don't need computers.
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera.
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go.
Camera's ready -- that's it.
or illusions or so on, and that some of them are real,
it's more likely that all of them are fake, like the crop circles.
between data and theory.
In the case of Galileo, he had two problems
when he turned his telescope to Saturn.
First of all, there was no theory of planetary rings.
Second of all, his data was grainy and fuzzy,
and he couldn't quite make out what he was looking at.
So he wrote that he had seen --
"I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies."
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw.
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data,
you can't have a good theory.
It wasn't solved until 1655.
people made trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn.
It wasn't till Huygens had two things:
He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated,
and he had better telescopic, more fine-grain data
in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster --
according to Kepler's Laws -- than Saturn, then we catch up with it.
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles, there.
And that, in fact, turns out to be true.
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things
is that we have things, on a simple level,
and then I'll go to more serious ones.
Like, we have a tendency to see faces.
In 1976, where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area
because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians.
Here's the close-up of it from 2001.
If you squint, you can still see the face.
And when you're squinting,
you're turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain,
so you're reducing the quality of your data.
And if I didn't tell you what to look for, you'd still see the face,
because we're programmed by evolution to see faces.
And of course, happy faces, faces of all kinds are easy to see.
You see the happy face on Mars, there.
Do you see him there? Little froggy legs.
Or if geologists were elephants?
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun
till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa's lawyer.
Here's Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville, just down the street,
or is it up the street from here?
Tree bark is particularly good because it's nice and grainy, branchy,
black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking --
humans are pattern-seeking animals.
Here's when the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich --
which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino --
of course, this being America.
I actually went to see this one.
There was a lot of people there.
The faithful come in their wheelchairs and crutches, and so on.
We went down and investigated.
Just to give you a size, that's Dawkins, me and The Amazing Randi,
next to this two, two and a half story-sized image.
All these candles, thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this.
So we walked around the backside, to see what was going on.
It turns out wherever there's a sprinkler head and a palm tree,
you get the effect.
Here's the Virgin Mary on the backside, which they started to wipe off.
I guess you can only have one miracle per building.
with auditory illusions.
There's this film, "White Noise," with Michael Keaton,
about the dead talking back to us.
By the way, the whole business of talking to the dead is not that big a deal.
Anybody can do it, turns out.
It's getting the dead to talk back that's the really hard part.
There's a ReverseSpeech.com web page where I downloaded this stuff.
This is the most famous one of all of these.
Here's the forward version of the very famous song.
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen.
Yes, there are two paths you can go by, but in the long run,
There's still time to change the road you're on.
and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there.
Now, I'll prime the auditory part of your brain
to tell you what you're supposed to hear, and then hear it again.
The Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization.
We're always looking for little good things that people do.
One of the top popular singers in England today, Katie Melua.
And she wrote a beautiful song.
It was in the top five in 2005, called, "Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing."
It's a love story -- she's sort of the Norah Jones of the UK --
about how she much loves her guy,
and compared to nine million bicycles, and so forth.
And she has this one passage here.
In America it'd be, "We're 6,000 light years from the edge."
who wrote the book "The Big Bang," and so on,
uses every chance he gets to promote good science.
And so he wrote an op-ed piece in "The Guardian" about Katie's song,
in which he said, well, we know exactly how far from the edge.
You know, it's 13.7 billion light years, and it's not a guess.
We know within precise error bars how close it is.
So we can say, although not absolutely true, it's pretty close to being true.
"I'm so embarrassed. I was in the astronomy club.
I should've known better."
And she re-cut the song.
So I will end with the new version.
from the edge of the observable universe.
That's a good estimate with well-defined error bars.
And with the available information,
I predict that I will always be with you.
as I've been preparing for my speech,
But then I started thinking about my family.
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather
and my great-grandfather,
and I realized
We have about 125 people internationally.
If you looked in the book,
you saw this ...
and I talk about the makeup of me.
this is my science slide.
This is math, and this is science, this is genetics.
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.

You may have heard about Rathergate,

if not millions, of readers,
and that's incredibly important.
During the hurricane,
you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,
updating it frequently.
This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.
That's all he does now,
and this is something that blogs have made possible.
I am not that caring.
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,
and I am an expert on this person,
because I was a designer,
but I wasn't being really stimulated.
and I started to create things like these little stories.
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,
and how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp,
and basically by the end,
They couldn't find me, they sent a search party,
but I could be famous to people on the Internet."
And I won it -- I reached all of these people,
and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.
I wrote a post
I don't know anything about music.
and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,
and I said, "I could do that."
he won an award for being hot.
You're just like your dad," who collects instruments.
he was such a tyrant -- he would not let me buy this banjo.
And those people who know me understood my joke --
this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant,
this person is so loving and so sweet
that he lets me dress him up
and post pictures of him to my blog.
and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post
about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."
But I got emails from people that said,
"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?

And why are they reading this?"
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.
I don't want to write for this public audience.
And I started to kill my blog slowly.
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore.
Slowly and slowly --
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.

It's this record of who you are, your persona.
You have your Google search, where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"
But then you also find people's blogs,
and those are the records of people that are writing daily --
not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.
We're getting into China, we want to be there,

think about what you've thought of them,
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.
I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
I was in India this past year,
and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world.
There's nothing that makes you feel more --
the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that --
than to know that something that horrible no longer exists.
So I'm going to tell you --
(Applause)
so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures.
They are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism,
because the horror of these pictures will be matched
by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.
My background is not exactly the conventional medical education
that you might expect.
When I was an intern in San Francisco,
I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island,
and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island,
and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.
I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.
She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island;
I landed in San Francisco;
and all the press wanted to talk to me,
because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs.
(Laughter)
Someone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me
if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor
for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride
from San Francisco to England.
And I said, yes, I would do that,
so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie
called "Medicine Ball Caravan."
(Laughter)
Now, you know from the '60s,
you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.
My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.
Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London,
then we switched buses at the big pond.
We then got on two more buses
and we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan,
over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor.
This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.
We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass.
But we wound up in India.
And then, like everyone else in our generation,
we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.
for those of you that are in medical school.
(Laughter)
And we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba,
who then told me to get rid of the dress,
put on a three-piece suit,
go join the United Nations as a diplomat
and work for the World Health Organization.
And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated,
and that this was God's gift to humanity,
because of the hard work of dedicated scientists.
And that prediction came true.
This little girl is Rahima Banu,
and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world.
And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed,
certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.
I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.
Can you say that?
It killed more people than all the wars in history.
In the last century, it killed 500 million people.
You're reading about Larry Page already.
Somebody reads very fast.
(Laughter)
In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin --
with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation --
in the year in which they were born,
two million people died of smallpox.
We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.
This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health,
[Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you
to be the richest and the strongest,
and to be kings and queens of the world,
did not protect you from dying of smallpox.
Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.
is the wrong perspective.
You should see it from the perspective of a mother,
watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly.
Day one, day two, day three,
day four, day five, day six.
You're a mother and you're watching your child,
and on day six, you see pustules that become hard.
Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication.
Day eight.
that the most photographed image in the world,
the most printed image in the world,
was that of the Earth.
But this was in 1974, and as of that moment,
this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed,
because we printed two billion copies of this photograph,
and we took them hand to hand, door to door,
to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house,
because that was our surveillance system.
We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers,
we didn't have computers.
I look at this picture and I say, "Thank God,"
because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox,
and I know this child will live.
And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,
but you know this child has no other secondary infection.
And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.
This is confluent smallpox,
in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger
and not be covered by lesions.
Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it.
And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all,
which had a predilection for pregnant women.
I've probably had 50 women die.
They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.
I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.
to eradicate a disease.
In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox.
By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.
1974, we were down to five countries.
But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India.
And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand.
In 1974, India had a population of 600 million.
There are 21 linguistic states in India,
which is like saying 21 different countries.
There are 20 million people on the road at any time,
in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households,
and none of them wanted to report
if they had a case of smallpox in their house,
because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity,
Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,
and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house
when the deity was in the house.
No incentive to report smallpox.
smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world.
So, how we eradicated smallpox was --
mass vaccination wouldn't work.
You could vaccinate everybody in India,
but one year later there'd be 21 million new babies,
which was then the population of Canada.
It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.
You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world
at the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it.
And that's what we did.
In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door,
with that same picture,
to every single house in India.
We made over one billion house calls.
Every time we did a house-to-house search,
we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.
When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease.
When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease.
A surveillance system was necessary,
because what we needed was early detection, early response.
So we searched and we searched,
and we found every case of smallpox in India.
We had a reward. We raised the reward.
We continued to increase the reward.
We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house.
And as we did that,
the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero.
And in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.
until the Iraq war.
150,000 people from all over the world --
doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation,
who fought side by side, brothers and sisters,
with each other, not against each other,
in a common cause to make the world better.
But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication.
We failed three other times.
We failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws.
But soon we may see polio eradicated.
But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.
This may be the year we eradicate polio.
That will make it the second disease in history.
And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast --
David, keep on going. We're close!
We're down to four countries.
Barry Bonds can replace me any time.
I was just in India working on the polio program.
The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.
That is the surveillance system.
But we need to have early detection, early response.
Blindness, the same thing.
The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys
and finding out the causes of blindness,
so you can mount the correct response.
of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,
who, having climbed the highest mountain,
tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease,
wanted to do it again.
And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries
have given back sight to more than two million blind people.
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons
of surveillance and epidemiology
to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue:
blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.
and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working,
and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.
And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health,
and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done,
and we had astonishing results.
Instead of finding out what we thought was the case --
that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma --
we were astounded to find out
that blindness was caused instead by cataract.
You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.
about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.
I hope that you will take a look at it.
Aravind, which started as a Seva project,
is now the world's largest and best eye hospital.
This year, that one hospital will give back sight
to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.
(Applause)
Bird flu.
I stand here as a representative of all terrible things --
this might be the worst.
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu
is early detection and rapid response.
We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral
to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.
WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.
We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage,
with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission,
but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.
this will not be like Katrina.
The world as we know it will stop.
There'll be no airplanes flying.
Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know,
coughing and sneezing,
when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you,
for which you had no antivirals or vaccine?
I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October.
I asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza --
and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them:
What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?
If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?
But much worse than that,
90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic
within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.
And they thought that if there was a pandemic,
a billion people would get sick.
As many as 165 million people would die.
There would be a global recession and depression
as our just-in-time inventory system
and the tight rubber band of globalization broke,
and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars
would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying,
because so many more people would lose their job
and their healthcare benefits,
that the consequences are almost unthinkable.
And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.
So we know what we're talking about.
Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.
It initially goes quite slowly.
You get two or three discrete locations.
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread
from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.
Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.
Now, if we had an "undo" button, and we could go back and isolate it
and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early,
and we had early detection and early response,
and we could put each one of those viruses in jail --
that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic.
And let me show you why that is.
This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine,
I think, ultimately gets to know what it is.
But the joke is,
an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here
and ride to glory on the downhill curve.
(Laughter)
But you don't get to do that usually.
You usually arrive right about here.
What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic.
But you can't always do that.
But there's an organization that has been able to find a way
to learn when the first cases occur,
and that is called GPHIN;
it's the Global Public Health Information Network.
And that simulation that I showed you
that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS.
And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur.
And it didn't occur
because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS
three months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that,
we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.
And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude
to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,
who I hope is in the audience some place -- over there --
who's the founder of GPHIN.
because not only did GPHIN find SARS early,
but you may have seen last week
that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran,
but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 --
but last September.
We need an early-warning system
to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare.
And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator
of these experiences.
Smallpox -- early detection, early response.
Blindness, polio -- early detection, early response.
Pandemic bird flu -- early detection, early response.
It is a litany.
It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases
is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.
an early-warning system --
to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares.
And what I thought I would call it is "Early Detection,"
But it should really be called ...
"Total Early Detection." [TED]
What?
What?
(Applause)
because this idea is birthed in TED,
I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it
the "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."
[INSTEDD]
And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.
So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu,
we find it and immediately contain it.
Instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error,
or shift or drift, we find it and we contain it.
Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills
or the catastrophe in Bhopal,
we find them, and we respond to them.
Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late,
we detect it, and we respond.
And instead of a system which is owned by a government,
and hidden in the bowels of government,
let's build an early detection system
that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.
not owned by any single country or company,
housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup
in a different time zone and a different continent.
And let's build it on GPHIN.
Let's start with GPHIN.
Let's increase the websites that they crawl
from 20,000 to 20 million.
Let's increase the languages they crawl
from seven to 70, or more.
Let's build in outbound confirmation messages,
using text messages or SMS or instant messaging
to find out from people who are within 100 meters
of the rumor that you hear,
if it is, in fact, valid.
And let's add satellite confirmation.
And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.
finding out those terrible things
before anybody else knows about them,
and sending our response to them,
so that next year, instead of us meeting here,
lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world,
we will have pulled together,
used the unique skills and the magic of this community,
and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics,
other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.
First of all, just so everyone understands:
you're saying that by creating web crawlers,
looking on the Internet for patterns,
they can detect something suspicious
before WHO, before anyone else can see it?
Give an example of how that could possibly be true.
I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.
When he started GPHIN --
In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu -- H5N1.
It was in Hong Kong.
And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately,
by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds,
and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks.
Immediate detection, immediate response.
Then a number of years went by,
and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu.
Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web --
only crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals --
and they read about and heard about a concern,
of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.
because WHO will only receive a report from a government,
because it's the United Nations.
But they were able to point to WHO and let them know
that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses
that looked like bird flu.
That turned out to be SARS.
That's how the world found out about SARS.
And because of that, we were able to stop SARS.
Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN,
100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things --
whether you're talking about famine
or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola --
100 percent of all those reports came from nations.
on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year -- got cracking,
75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN,
25 percent of all the reports in the world
came from all the other 180 nations.
Now, here's what's really interesting:
after they'd been working for a couple years,
what do you think happened to those nations?
They felt pretty stupid.
So they started sending in their reports early.
And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent,
because other nations have started to report.
So, can you find diseases early by crawling the web?
Of course you can.
Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now?
Of course you can.
You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler
a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler.
Well, they're only crawling in seven languages.
These bad viruses really don't have any intention
of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.
I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can.
I want to make this open to everybody,
so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar
will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.
And I want to make it part of our culture
that there is a community of people who are watching out
for the worst nightmares of humanity,
and that it's accessible to everyone.
I don't know about you, but I haven't quite figured out
exactly what technology means in my life.
I've spent the past year thinking about what it really should be about.
Should I be pro-technology? Should I embrace it full arms?
Should I be wary? Like you, I'm very tempted by the latest thing.
But at the other hand, a couple of years ago
I gave up all of my possessions,
sold all my technology -- except for a bicycle --
and rode across 3,000 miles on the U.S. back roads under the power of my one body,
fuelled mostly by Twinkies and junk food.
at arm's length in many ways, so it doesn't master my life.
At the same time, I run a website on cool tools,
where I issue a daily obsession of the latest things in technology.
So I'm still perplexed about what the true meaning of technology is
as it relates to humanity, as it relates to nature,
as it relates to the spiritual.
And I'm not even sure we know what technology is.
And one definition of technology is that which is first recorded.
This is the first example of the modern use of technology that I can find.
It was the suggested syllabus for dealing with
the Applied Arts and Science at Cambridge University in 1829.
I like one of the definitions that Alan Kay has for technology.
He says technology is anything that was invented after you were born.
Danny Hillis actually has an update on that --
he says technology is anything that doesn't quite work yet.
But I was interested in another definition of technology.
Something, again, that went back to something more fundamental.
Something that was deeper. And as I struggled to understand that,
I came up with a way of framing the question
that seemed to work for me in my investigations.
And I'm, this morning, going to talk about this for the first time.
So this is a very rough attempt to think out loud.
what does technology want? And by that, I don't mean,
does it want chocolate or vanilla? By what it wants, I mean,
what are its inherent trends and biases?
What are its tendencies over time? One way to think about this is
thinking about biological organisms, which we've heard a lot about.
And the trick that Richard Dawkins does, which is to say,
to look at them as simply as genes, as vehicles for genes.
So he's saying, what do genes want? The selfish gene.
And I'm applying a similar trick to say,
what if we looked at the universe in our culture
through the eyes of technology? What does technology want?
Obviously, this in an incomplete question,
just as looking at an organism as only a gene
is an incomplete way of looking at it.
But it's still very, very productive. So I'm attempting to say,
if we take technology's view of the world, what does it want?
And I think once we ask that question
we have to go back, actually, to life. Because obviously,
if we keep extending the origins of technology far back,
I think we come back to life at some point.
And like you heard from the previous speakers,
we don't really know what life there is on Earth right now.
We have really no idea.
Craig Venter's tremendous and brilliant attempt
to DNA sequence things in the ocean is great.
Brian Farrell's work is all part of this agenda to try
and actually discover all the species on Earth.
And one of the things that we should do is just make a grid of the globe
and randomly go and inspect all the places that the grid intersects,
just to see what's on life. And if we did that
with our little Martian probe, which we have not done on Earth,
we would begin to see some incredible species.
that are hidden away on our planet.
This is an ant that stores its colleagues' honey in its abdomen.
Each one of these organisms that we've described -- that you've seen
from Jamie and others, these magnificent things --
what they're doing, each one of them,
is they're hacking the rules of life.
I can't think of a single general principle of biology
that does not have an exception somewhere by some organism.
Every single thing that we can think of --
and if you heard Olivia's talk about the sexual habits,
you'll realize that there isn't anything we can say that's true for all life,
because every single one of them is hacking something about it.
This is a solar-powered sea slug. It's a nudibranch
that has incorporated chloroplast inside it to drive its energy.
This is another version of that. This is a sea dragon,
and the one on the bottom, the blue one, is a juvenile that has not yet
swallowed the acid, has not yet taken in
the brown-green algae pond scum into its body to give it energy.
of the approaches to hacking life there are, current consensus,
six kingdoms. Six different broad approaches: the plants,
the animals, the fungi, the protests -- the little things -- the bacteria
and the Archaea bacteria. The Archaeas.
Those are the general approaches to life. That's one way to look at life on Earth today.
the current way to take the long view,
is to look at it in an evolutionary perspective.
And here we have a view of evolution where rather than having evolution
go over the linear time, we have it coming out from the center.
So in the center is the most primitive, and this is a genealogical chart
of all life on earth. This is all the same six kingdoms.
You see 4,000 representative species, and you can see where we are.
But what I like about this is it shows that
every living organism on Earth today is equally evolved.
Those fungi and bacteria are as highly evolved as humans.
They've been around just as long and gone through
just the same kind of trial and error to get here.
But we see that each one of these is actually hacking,
and has a different way of finding out how to do life.
what does evolution want? There's several things that we see.
One of the things about evolution is that nowhere on Earth
have we ever been where we don't find life.
We find life at the bottom of every long-term,
long-distance drilling core into the center of rock
that we bring up -- and there's bacteria in the pores of that rock.
And wherever life is, it never retreats. It's ubiquitous and it wants to be more.
More and more of the inert matter of the globe
is being touched and animated by life.
We see the movement from a general-purpose cell
to the more specific and specialized.
And we see a drift towards complexity that's very intuitive.
And actually, we have current data that does show
that there is an actual drift towards complexity over time.
And the last thing, I bring back this nudibranch.
One of the things we see about life is that it moves
from the inner to increasing sociability. And by that it means
that there is more and more of life whose entire environment is other life.
Like those chloroplast cells --
they're completely surrounded by other life.
They never touch the inner matter. There is more and more co-evolution.
And so the general, long-term trends of evolution
are roughly these five: ubiquity, diversity, specialization,
complexity and socialization. Now, I took that and said,
OK, what are the long-term trends in technology?
And so, remarkably, I discovered
that there's also a drift toward specialization.
That we see there's a general hammer,
and hammers become more and more specific over time.
There's obviously diversity. Huge numbers of things.
This is all the contents of a Japanese home.
I actually had my daughter -- gave her a tally counter,
and I gave her an assignment last summer to go around
and count the number of species of technology in our household.
And it came up with 6,000 different species of products.
I did some research and found out that the King of England, Henry VIII,
had only about 7,000 items in his household.
And he was the King of England,
and that was the entire wealth of England at the time.
So we're seeing huge numbers of diversity in the kinds of things.
and he sees machines making machines. How depraved!
Well, this is actually what we're headed towards: world machines.
And the technology is only being thrown out by other technologies.
Most machines will only ever be in contact with other technology
and not non-technology, or even life.
is at this point a cliche. And I'm happy to say,
I was partly responsible for that cliche
that machines are becoming biological, but that's pretty evident.
So the major trends in technology evolution actually
are the same as in biological evolution. The same drives that we see
towards ubiquity, towards diversity, towards socialization,
towards complexity. That is maybe not a big surprise
because if we map out, say, the evolution of armor,
you can actually follow a sort of an evolutionary-type cladistic tree.
I suggest that, in fact, technology is the seventh kingdom of life.
That its operations and how it works is so similar
that we can think of it as the seventh kingdom.
And so it would be sort of approximately up there,
coming out of the animal kingdom. And if we were to do that,
we would find out -- we could actually approach technology in this way.
of the theory of punctuated equilibrium.
But as a sideline, he happens to collect cornets.
He has one of the world's largest collections -- about 500 of them.
And he has decided to treat them as if they were trilobites, or snails,
and to do a morphological analysis,
and try to derive their genealogical history over time.
This is his chart, which is not quite published yet.
But the most interesting aspect about this
is that if you look at those red lines at the bottom,
those indicate basically a parentage of a type of cornet
that was no longer made. That does not happen in biology.
When something is extinct, you can't have it as your parent.
But that does happen in technology. And it turns out
that that's so distinctive that you can actually look at this tree,
and you can actually use it to determine
that this is a technological system versus a biological system.
that I began to think about what happens with old technology.
And it turns out that, in fact, technologies don't die.
So I suggested this to an historian of science, and he said,
"Well, what about, you know, come on, what about steam cars?
They're not around anymore." Well actually, they are.
In fact, they're so around that you can buy new parts for a Stanley steam automobile.
And this is a website of a guy who's selling brand new parts
for the Stanley automobile. And the thing that I liked
is sort of this one-click, add-to-your-cart button --
And so, I began to think about, well, maybe that's just a random sample.
Maybe I should do this sort of in a more conservative way.
and I randomly went through it. And I took a page -- not quite a random page --
I took a page that was actually more difficult than others
because lots of the pages are filled with things
that are still being made. But I took this page
and I said, how many of these things are still being made?
And not antiques. I want to know how many of these things are still in production.
And the answer is: all of them.
All of them are still being produced. So you've got corn shellers.
I don't know who needs a corn sheller.
Be it corn shellers -- you've got ploughs; you've got fan mills;
all these things -- and these are not, again, antiques. These are --
you can order these. You can go to the web and you can buy them now,
brand-new made. So in a certain sense, technologies don't die.
In fact, you can buy, for 50 bucks, a stone-age knife
made exactly the same way that they were made 10,000 years ago.
It's short, bone handle, 50 bucks. And in fact,
what's important is that this information actually never died out.
It's not just that it was resurrected. It's continued all along.
And in Papua New Guinea, they were making stone axes
until two decades ago, just as a course of practical matters.
So we've all heard about the Amish giving up cars.
We've heard about the Japanese giving up guns.
We've heard about this and that. But I actually went back and
took what I could find, the examples in history
where there have been prohibitions against technology,
and then I tried to find out when they came back in,
because they always came back in. And it turns out that the time,
the duration of when they were outlawed and prohibited,
is decreasing over time. And that basically, you can delay technology,
but you can't kill it. So this makes sense, because in a certain sense
what culture is, is the accumulation of ideas.
That's what it's for. It's so that ideas don't die out.
And when we take that, we take this idea of what culture is doing
and add it to what the long-term trajectory -- again, in life's evolution --
we find that each case -- each of the major transitions in life --
what they're really about is accelerating and changing
the way in which evolution happens.
They're actually changing the way in which ideas are generated.
the evolution of evolvability.
So what's happening over time in life is
that the ways in which you generate these new ideas, these new hacks,
are increasing. And the real tricks are ways
in which you kind of explore the way of exploring.
And then what we see in the singularity,
that prophesized by Kurzweil and others --
his idea that technology is accelerating evolution.
It's accelerating the way in which we search for ideas.
So if you have life hacking --
life means hacking, the game of survival --
then evolution is a way to extend the game by changing the rules of the game.
And what technology is really about is better ways to evolve.
That is what we call an "infinite game."
That's the definition of "infinite game." A finite game is play to win,
and an infinite game is played to keep playing.
And I believe that technology is actually a cosmic force.
but was actually at the beginning of the Big Bang,
and at that moment the entire huge billions of stars in the universe
were compressed. The entire universe was compressed into a little quantum dot,
and it was so tight in there, there was no room for any difference at all.
That's the definition. There was no temperature.
There was no difference whatsoever. And at the Big Bang,
what it expanded was the potential for difference.
So as it expands and as things expand what we have
is the potential for differences, diversity, options, choices,
opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.
Those are all basically the same thing.
And those are the things that technology brings us.
That's what technology is bringing us: choices, possibilities, freedoms.
That's what it's about. It's this expansion of room to make differences.
And so a hammer, when we grab a hammer, that's what we're grabbing.
And that's why we continue to grab technology --
because we want those things. Those things are good.
Differences, freedom, choices, possibilities.
And each time we make a new opportunity place,
we're allowing a platform to make new ones.
Mozart before the technology of the piano was invented --
what a loss to society there would be.
Imagine Van Gogh being born
before the technologies of cheap oil paints.
Imagine Hitchcock before the technologies of film.
Somewhere, today, there are millions of young children being born
whose technology of self-expression has not yet been invented.
We have a moral obligation to invent technology
so that every person on the globe has the potential
to realize their true difference.
We want a trillion zillion species of one individuals.
That's what technology really wants.
because I don't have answers to why there's deforestation.
I don't have an answer to the fact that there seem to be
bad technologies. I don't have an answer to
how this impacts on our dignity, other than to suggest that
maybe the seventh kingdom, because it's so close to what life is about,
maybe we can bring it back and have it help us monitor life.
Maybe in some ways
the fact that what we're trying to do with technology is find a good home for it.
It's a terrible thing to spray DDT on cotton fields,
but it's a really good thing to use
to eliminate millions of cases of death due to malaria in a small village.
All the things that we think that we really like about humanity
is being driven by technology. This is the infinite game.
That's what we're talking about.
You see, technology is a way to evolve the evolution.
It's a way to explore possibilities and opportunities and create more.
And it's actually a way of playing the game, of playing all the games.
That's what technology wants.
And so when I think about what technology wants,
I think that it has to do with the fact that every person here -- and I really believe this --
every person here has an assignment. And your assignment is
to spend your life discovering what your assignment is.
That recursive nature is the infinite game.
And if you play that well, you'll have other people involved,
so even that game extends and continues even when you're gone.
That is the infinite game. And what technology is
is the medium in which we play that infinite game.
And so I think that we should embrace technology
because it is an essential part of our journey
in finding out who we are.
and my father was reading the paper or something,
and I sort of presented myself to them in the doorway, and they said,
"Hey, happy birthday!" And I said, "I'm seven."
And my father smiled and said,
"Well, you know what that means, don't you?"
And I said, "Yeah, that I'm going to have a party
and you're now capable of committing any and all sins against God and man."
my second-grade class at school.
And my mom said, "Well, I noticed it."
And my dad said, "Yeah, but, honey,
I think that's technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas."
that instead of Santa delivering our presents
Santa would come to our house while we were at nine o'clock high mass
on Christmas morning, but only if all of us kids did not make a fuss.
It was pretty obvious that it was really our parents giving us the presents.
I mean, my dad had a very distinctive wrapping style,
and my poor parents were trying to protect us from the embarrassment,
this humiliation of rejection by Santa, who was jolly --
but let's face it, he was also very judgmental.
It was too late for me, but maybe I could help someone else,
someone who could use the information.
The answer was clear: my brother Bill. He was six.
I ran up to him and said, "Bill!
I just realized that the age of reason starts when you turn seven,
But when I got to the top of the steps,
but I really wasn't turning seven on September 10th.
so I started to tell you your birthday was September 10th.
But, Julie, you were so ready to start school, honey. You were so ready."
I thought about it, and when I was four,
I was already the oldest of four children,
and my mother even had another child to come,
so what I think she -- understandably -- really meant
I made sure that you ate a piece of cake that day."
What was most upsetting was that this meant I was not a Virgo.
I had a huge Virgo poster in my bedroom.
The Virgo poster is a picture of a beautiful woman with long hair,
but the Libra poster is just a huge scale.
and I started to read my new Libra horoscope,
on this whole age-of-reason, change-of-birthday thing,
to do anything I wanted to before God started keeping tabs on me.
One day, two Mormon missionaries came to my door.
for people who are peddling things door to door.
Sometimes I get little old ladies from the Seventh Day Adventist Church
showing me these cartoon pictures of heaven.
and they said they had a message for me, from God.
Now, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest,
around a lot of Church of Latter-day Saints people and, you know,
I've worked with them and even dated them,
but I never really knew the doctrine,
or what they said to people when they were out on a mission,
and I guess I was sort of curious, so I said, "Well, please, come in."
Don't touch my hair, that's the thing.
and expect me not to fix my hair.
Ok.
And I thought, "Well, of course I believe in God,
who lived in Jerusalem in 600 BC.
And God came to Lehi and said to him,
And they said, "Yes."
reproduced and reproduced, and over the course of 600 years,
there were two great races of them, the Nephites and the Lamanites,
they would win the war against the evil Lamanites.
But apparently somebody blew it,
because the Lamanites were able to kill all the Nephites.
And they said, "No." And I said, "Why?"
it is so wonderful, that the only gift he had left over to give men
They said, "Well, it's her ability to bear children."
They said, "Well, we also believe that if you're a Mormon,
and if you're in good standing with the church,
And I said, "Oh, dear.
you get your body restored to you in its best original state.
Like, if you'd lost a leg, well, you get it back.
Or, if you'd gone blind, you could see."
What if you had a nose job and you liked it?
and smug in my more conventional faith.
and they said, "We believe that God impregnated a very young girl
without the use of intercourse,
and the fact that she was a virgin is maniacally important to us."
I'm just so used to that story.
and I feel God's love when I look with gratitude at all the beauty I see."
because I wasn't exactly sure if I believed what I so clearly felt.
She's not. She's at the TED Prize."
and I've filmed some of them,
you'd understand a little bit why.
(Applause)
is a way for people to travel,
to meet people in a different way than --
because you can't travel all over the world at the same time.
And a long time ago -- well, about 40 years ago --
I really think as the world is getting smaller,
And I know that we can't all do exchange programs,
and I can't force everybody to travel;
and just requires a movie camera, a projector and a screen.
And that's what I'm going to talk to you about today.
because of where I come from.
No pun intended.
(Laughter)
the "Middle East Peace Crisis."
It all kind of started that way,
There was a center there,
and get vaccinations against the many diseases
you can get from sorting through garbage.
And I began teaching there.
I taught English, and I met some incredible women there.
I met people that live seven people to a room,
barely can afford their evening meal,
I took pictures of weddings and older family members --
things that they wanted memories of.
the UN Conference on Population and Development
asked me to show them at the conference.
So I was 18; I was very excited.
It was my first exhibit of photographs and they were all put up there,
and after about two days, they all came down except for three.
very angry that I was showing these dirty sides of Cairo,
and why didn't I cut the dead donkey out of the frame?
And as I sat there, I got very depressed.
that had come out of people just seeing these photographs.
Here I was, this 18-year-old pipsqueak that nobody listened to,
and all of a sudden, I put these photographs on the wall,
in such difficult circumstances.
And I think it was at that point
that I decided I wanted to use photography and film
and I've done a couple of music films.
But in 2003, when the war in Iraq was about to start,
And I was watching television in New York,
was that there was going to be this clean war and precision bombings,
and the Iraqis would be greeting the Americans as liberators,
and throwing flowers at their feet in the streets of Baghdad.
I knew that there was a completely other story being told,
How are people supposed to have any kind of common understanding
or know how to move together into the future?
So I knew that I had to go there.
I just wanted to be in the center.
I had no plan. I had no funding.
because I wanted to get access to Al Jazeera,
George Bush's favorite channel,
I've got to go see what this is all about.
And I also wanted to go see Central Command,
which was 10 minutes away.
on the Arab side, reaching the Arab world,
and on the US and Western side, reaching the US.
and met these people that were in the center of it,
and sat with these characters,
The amazing complexity of people emerges.
Iraq, and then Iraq, and then Iraq.
but I have plans for my children.
Josh Rushing: The night they showed the POWs and the dead soldiers --
a cold tile floor.
And it was revolting.
It was absolutely revolting.
And they were equally, if not more, horrifying -- the images were.
And I remember having seen it in the Al Jazeera office,
and thought to myself, "Wow, that's gross.
we had such incredible reactions.
It was amazing to see how people were moved by this film.
In the Arab world --
and it's not really by the film, it's by the characters --
And when I showed the film in the Middle East,
people wanted to meet Josh.
He kind of redefined us as an American population.
Al Jazeera offered him a job.
And Samir, on the other hand,
was also quite an interesting character for the Arab world to see,
because it brought out the complexities of this love-hate relationship
the positive motivations of the American people
when they'd see this film.
and people's reactions to some of our policy abroad,
we feel this power, that we need to --
until you see the people in the hospitals and the victims of the war,
and how do we get out of this bubble?
Now, I don't know whether a film can change the world.
Because I believe that film has the ability to take you across borders,
I'd like you to just sit back and experience for a couple of minutes
being taken into another world.
[We still have Paradise.]
[May God forgive you.]
[If you were not Abu Azzam's daughter ...]
[Anyway, I'd rather have Paradise in my head than live in this hell!]
[In this life, we're dead anyway.]
[Don't you see what you're doing is destroying us?]
["There was a suicide bombing in Tel Aviv."]
[Tzvika off-screen: We're looking for three girls.]
You could give them a long political speech,
and they felt that feeling of transformation.
to actually create a movement through film?
that if we have an appreciation for another person's humanity,
It's about connecting people through film,
getting these independent voices out there.
Now, Josh Rushing actually ended up leaving the military
and taking a job with Al Jazeera.
And that's an amazing thing.
But I've been trying to think about ways
to give power to these independent voices,
to give power to the filmmakers,
to give power to people who are trying to use film for change.
And there are incredible organizations
that are out there doing this already.
There's Witness, that you heard from earlier.
and she believes that there are peaceful ways to solve this.
There's Working Films and there's Current TV,
independent voices from around the world --
and create a truly democratic, global television.
to create some momentum,
getting together, and sitting in the dark,
Comedies, documentaries, shorts.
This amazing power can be used to change people
So if you imagine this day when all around the world,
the same film in Ramallah, the same film in Jerusalem.
You know, we've been talking to a friend of mine
in terms of where you can project films
and where you can have this communal experience.
And I believe that this one day, if we can create it,
this one day can create momentum for all of these independent voices.
and yet I'm hearing throughout this conference
and having mutual respect for the other and crossing borders.
And if film can do that,
and if we can get all of these different locations in the world
And we started calling up everybody.
from as close as Palo Alto, to Mongolia and to India.
and I'd like to share this with you.
so that we can build community
and have these communities working together, through the Internet?
And we call that landmass Pangea.
but the only way that I know how to do it,
And I know that there are independent filmmakers and films out there
that can really make this happen.
Pangea Cinema: The day the world comes together.
the power of film.
I'm really excited to be here today.
I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab,
can only register one point of contact at a time.
I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to.
low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it
or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.
I could be doing this with as many fingers here,
but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.
Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava,
where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable,
This is a photographer's light-box application.
Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.
I can do that grossly with both of my hands,
especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.
Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop,
but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.
There's so little applied now to actually improving
the way we interact with interfaces from this point on.
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go.
You can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology,
a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away,
and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke.
and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time:
I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points.
And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.
It was released at SIGGRAPH last year.
I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it.
Well, I thought there would be a podium, so I'm a bit scared.
(Laughter)
Chris asked me to tell again how we found the structure of DNA.
And since, you know, I follow his orders, I'll do it.
But it slightly bores me.
(Laughter)
And, you know, I wrote a book. So I'll say something --
(Laughter)
-- I'll say a little about, you know, how the discovery was made,
and why Francis and I found it.
And then, I hope maybe I have at least five minutes to say
what makes me tick now.
I was at the University of Chicago, in my third year,
and I was in my third year because the University of Chicago
let you in after two years of high school.
So you -- it was fun to get away from high school -- (Laughter) --
because I was very small, and I was no good in sports,
or anything like that.
raised to be an Episcopalian and Republican,
but after one year of college, he became an atheist and a Democrat.
(Laughter)
And my mother was Irish Catholic,
and -- but she didn't take religion too seriously.
And by the age of 11, I was no longer going to Sunday Mass,
and going on birdwatching walks with my father.
So early on, I heard of Charles Darwin.
I guess, you know, he was the big hero.
And, you know, you understand life as it now exists through evolution.
and thought I would end up, you know, if I was bright enough,
maybe getting a Ph.D. from Cornell in ornithology.
Then, in the Chicago paper, there was a review of a book
called "What is Life?" by the great physicist, Schrodinger.
And that, of course, had been a question I wanted to know.
You know, Darwin explained life after it got started,
but what was the essence of life?
present in our chromosomes, and it had to be present
on a molecule. I'd never really thought of molecules before.
You know chromosomes, but this was a molecule,
and somehow all the information was probably present
in some digital form. And there was the big question
of, how did you copy the information?
I wanted to be a geneticist --
understand the gene and, through that, understand life.
So I had, you know, a hero at a distance.
It wasn't a baseball player; it was Linus Pauling.
And so I applied to Caltech and they turned me down.
(Laughter)
So I went to Indiana,
which was actually as good as Caltech in genetics,
and besides, they had a really good basketball team. (Laughter)
So I had a really quite happy life at Indiana.
And it was at Indiana I got the impression
that, you know, the gene was likely to be DNA.
And so when I got my Ph.D., I should go and search for DNA.
maybe I could become a biochemist,
but I discovered biochemistry was very boring.
It wasn't going anywhere toward, you know, saying what the gene was;
it was just nuclear science. And oh, that's the book, little book.
You can read it in about two hours.
And -- but then I went to a meeting in Italy.
And there was an unexpected speaker who wasn't on the program,
and he talked about DNA.
And this was Maurice Wilkins. He was trained as a physicist,
and after the war he wanted to do biophysics, and he picked DNA
because DNA had been determined at the Rockefeller Institute
to possibly be the genetic molecules on the chromosomes.
Most people believed it was proteins.
But Wilkins, you know, thought DNA was the best bet,
and he showed this x-ray photograph.
Sort of crystalline. So DNA had a structure,
even though it owed it to probably different molecules
carrying different sets of instructions.
So there was something universal about the DNA molecule.
So I wanted to work with him, but he didn't want a former birdwatcher,
and I ended up in Cambridge, England.
because it was really the best place in the world then
for x-ray crystallography. And x-ray crystallography is now a subject
in, you know, chemistry departments.
I mean, in those days it was the domain of the physicists.
So the best place for x-ray crystallography
was at the Cavendish Laboratory at Cambridge.
And there I met Francis Crick.
I went there without knowing him. He was 35. I was 23.
And within a day, we had decided that
maybe we could take a shortcut to finding the structure of DNA.
Not solve it like, you know, in rigorous fashion, but build a model,
an electro-model, using some coordinates of, you know,
length, all that sort of stuff from x-ray photographs.
But just ask what the molecule -- how should it fold up?
is Linus Pauling. About six months before, he proposed
the alpha helical structure for proteins. And in doing so,
he banished the man out on the right,
Sir Lawrence Bragg, who was the Cavendish professor.
This is a photograph several years later,
when Bragg had cause to smile.
He certainly wasn't smiling when I got there,
because he was somewhat humiliated by Pauling getting the alpha helix,
and the Cambridge people failing because they weren't chemists.
And certainly, neither Crick or I were chemists,
so we tried to build a model. And he knew, Francis knew Wilkins.
So Wilkins said he thought it was the helix.
X-ray diagram, he thought was comparable with the helix.
The people from London came up.
Wilkins and this collaborator, or possible collaborator,
Rosalind Franklin, came up and sort of laughed at our model.
They said it was lousy, and it was.
So we were told to build no more models; we were incompetent.
(Laughter)
And so we didn't build any models,
and Francis sort of continued to work on proteins.
And basically, I did nothing. And -- except read.
You know, basically, reading is a good thing; you get facts.
And we kept telling the people in London
that Linus Pauling's going to move on to DNA.
If DNA is that important, Linus will know it.
He'll build a model, and then we're going to be scooped.
Could he see their x-ray photograph?
And they had the wisdom to say "no." So he didn't have it.
But there was ones in the literature.
Actually, Linus didn't look at them that carefully.
But about, oh, 15 months after I got to Cambridge,
a rumor began to appear from Linus Pauling's son,
who was in Cambridge, that his father was now working on DNA.
And so, one day Peter came in and he said he was Peter Pauling,
and he gave me a copy of his father's manuscripts.
And boy, I was scared because I thought, you know, we may be scooped.
I have nothing to do, no qualifications for anything.
(Laughter)
And I read it, and it was just -- it was crap.
(Laughter)
So this was, you know, unexpected from the world's --
(Laughter)
-- and so, it was held together by hydrogen bonds
between phosphate groups.
Well, if the peak pH that cells have is around seven,
those hydrogen bonds couldn't exist.
We rushed over to the chemistry department and said,
"Could Pauling be right?" And Alex Hust said, "No." So we were happy.
(Laughter)
that somebody at Caltech would tell Linus that he was wrong.
And so Bragg said, "Build models."
And a month after we got the Pauling manuscript --
I should say I took the manuscript to London, and showed the people.
Well, I said, Linus was wrong and that we're still in the game
and that they should immediately start building models.
But Wilkins said "no." Rosalind Franklin was leaving in about two months,
and after she left he would start building models.
And so I came back with that news to Cambridge,
and Bragg said, "Build models."
Well, of course, I wanted to build models.
And there's a picture of Rosalind. She really, you know,
in one sense she was a chemist,
but really she would have been trained --
she didn't know any organic chemistry or quantum chemistry.
She was a crystallographer.
was, she wasn't a chemist, whereas Pauling was a chemist.
And so Crick and I, you know, started building models,
and I'd learned a little chemistry, but not enough.
Well, we got the answer on the 28th February '53.
And it was because of a rule, which, to me, is a very good rule:
Never be the brightest person in a room, and we weren't.
We weren't the best chemists in the room.
I went in and showed them a pairing I'd done,
and Jerry Donohue -- he was a chemist -- he said, it's wrong.
You've got -- the hydrogen atoms are in the wrong place.
I just put them down like they were in the books.
He said they were wrong.
So I changed the locations, and then we found the base pairing,
and Francis immediately said the chains run in absolute directions.
And we knew we were right.
So it was a pretty, you know, it all happened in about two hours.
From nothing to thing.
And we knew it was big because, you know, if you just put A next to T
and G next to C, you have a copying mechanism.
So we saw how genetic information is carried.
It's the order of the four bases.
So in a sense, it is a sort of digital-type information.
And you copy it by going from strand-separating.
So, you know, if it didn't work this way, you might as well believe it,
because you didn't have any other scheme.
(Laughter)
Most scientists are really rather dull.
They said, we won't think about it until we know it's right.
But, you know, we thought, well, it's at least 95 percent right or 99 percent right.
So think about it. The next five years,
there were essentially something like five references
to our work in "Nature" -- none.
And so we were left by ourselves,
and trying to do the last part of the trio: how do you --
what does this genetic information do?
It was pretty obvious that it provided the information
to an RNA molecule, and then how do you go from RNA to protein?
For about three years we just -- I tried to solve the structure of RNA.
It didn't yield. It didn't give good x-ray photographs.
I was decidedly unhappy; a girl didn't marry me.
It was really, you know, sort of a shitty time.
(Laughter)
so I'm still looking happy.
(Laughter)
But there is what we did when we didn't know
where to go forward: we formed a club and called it the RNA Tie Club.
George Gamow, also a great physicist, he designed the tie.
He was one of the members. The question was:
How do you go from a four-letter code
to the 20-letter code of proteins?
Feynman was a member, and Teller, and friends of Gamow.
But that's the only -- no, we were only photographed twice.
And on both occasions, you know, one of us was missing the tie.
There's Francis up on the upper right,
and Alex Rich -- the M.D.-turned-crystallographer -- is next to me.
This was taken in Cambridge in September of 1955.
And I'm smiling, sort of forced, I think,
because the girl I had, boy, she was gone.
(Laughter)
because then we found out, basically, you know,
that there are three forms of RNA.
And we knew, basically, DNA provides the information for RNA.
RNA provides the information for protein.
And that let Marshall Nirenberg, you know, take RNA -- synthetic RNA --
put it in a system making protein. He made polyphenylalanine,
polyphenylalanine. So that's the first cracking of the genetic code,
and it was all over by 1966.
So there, that's what Chris wanted me to do, it was --
so what happened since then?
Well, at that time -- I should go back.
When we found the structure of DNA, I gave my first talk
at Cold Spring Harbor. The physicist, Leo Szilard,
he looked at me and said, "Are you going to patent this?"
And -- but he knew patent law, and that we couldn't patent it,
because you couldn't. No use for it.
(Laughter)
and the lawyers didn't enter into the equation until 1973,
20 years later, when Boyer and Cohen in San Francisco
and Stanford came up with their method of recombinant DNA,
and Stanford patented it and made a lot of money.
At least they patented something
which, you know, could do useful things.
And then, they learned how to read the letters for the code.
And, boom, we've, you know, had a biotech industry. And,
but we were still a long ways from, you know,
answering a question which sort of dominated my childhood,
which is: How do you nature-nurture?
but this is Michael Wigler, a very, very clever mathematician
turned physicist. And he developed a technique
which essentially will let us look at sample DNA
and, eventually, a million spots along it.
There's a chip there, a conventional one. Then there's one
made by a photolithography by a company in Madison
called NimbleGen, which is way ahead of Affymetrix.
And we use their technique.
And what you can do is sort of compare DNA of normal segs versus cancer.
And you can see on the top
that cancers which are bad show insertions or deletions.
So the DNA is really badly mucked up,
whereas if you have a chance of surviving,
the DNA isn't so mucked up.
So we think that this will eventually lead to what we call
"DNA biopsies." Before you get treated for cancer,
you should really look at this technique,
and get a feeling of the face of the enemy.
It's not a -- it's only a partial look, but it's a --
I think it's going to be very, very useful.
because there's lots of money for it, no government money.
And now I have a sort of vested interest:
I want to do it for prostate cancer. So, you know,
you aren't treated if it's not dangerous.
But Wigler, besides looking at cancer cells, looked at normal cells,
and made a really sort of surprising observation.
Which is, all of us have about 10 places in our genome
where we've lost a gene or gained another one.
So we're sort of all imperfect. And the question is well,
if we're around here, you know,
these little losses or gains might not be too bad.
But if these deletions or amplifications occurred in the wrong gene,
maybe we'll feel sick.
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it.
Looking at an individual is about 3,000 dollars. And the parent of a child
with Asperger's disease, the high-intelligence autism,
had sent his thing to a conventional company; they didn't do it.
Couldn't do it by conventional genetics, but just scanning it
we began to find genes for autism.
And you can see here, there are a lot of them.
So a lot of autistic kids are autistic
because they just lost a big piece of DNA.
I mean, big piece at the molecular level.
We saw one autistic kid,
about five million bases just missing from one of his chromosomes.
We haven't yet looked at the parents, but the parents probably
don't have that loss, or they wouldn't be parents.
Now, so, our autism study is just beginning. We got three million dollars.
I think it will cost at least 10 to 20 before you'd be in a position
to help parents who've had an autistic child,
or think they may have an autistic child,
and can we spot the difference?
So this same technique should probably look at all.
It's a wonderful way to find genes.
we've looked at 20 people with schizophrenia.
And we thought we'd probably have to look at several hundred
before we got the picture. But as you can see,
there's seven out of 20 had a change which was very high.
And yet, in the controls there were three.
So what's the meaning of the controls?
Were they crazy also, and we didn't know it?
Or, you know, were they normal? I would guess they're normal.
And what we think in schizophrenia is there are genes of predisposure,
and whether this is one that predisposes --
and then there's only a sub-segment of the population
that's capable of being schizophrenic.
but I think, to give you a hypothesis, the best guess
is that if you're left-handed, you're prone to schizophrenia.
30 percent of schizophrenic people are left-handed,
and schizophrenia has a very funny genetics,
which means 60 percent of the people are genetically left-handed,
but only half of it showed. I don't have the time to say.
Now, some people who think they're right-handed
are genetically left-handed. OK. I'm just saying that, if you think,
oh, I don't carry a left-handed gene so therefore my, you know,
children won't be at risk of schizophrenia. You might. OK?
(Laughter)
We ought to be able to find the gene for bipolar;
there's a relationship.
And if I had enough money, we'd find them all this year.
I thank you.
I'm here to enlist you
in helping reshape the story about how humans and other critters get things done.
Here is the old story -- we've already heard a little bit about it:
biology is war in which only the fiercest survive;
businesses and nations succeed only by defeating,
destroying and dominating competition;
But I think we can see the very beginnings of a new story beginning to emerge.
It's a narrative spread across a number of different disciplines,
in which cooperation, collective action and complex interdependencies
play a more important role.
And the central, but not all-important, role of competition and survival of the fittest
shrinks just a little bit to make room.
and collective action when I wrote "Smart Mobs,"
and I found that when I finished the book, I kept thinking about it.
In fact, if you look back, human communication media
and the ways in which we organize socially have been co-evolving for quite a long time.
Humans have lived for much, much longer
than the approximately 10,000 years of settled agricultural civilization
The form of wealth in those days was enough food to stay alive.
But at some point, they banded together to hunt bigger game.
And we don't know exactly how they did this,
although they must have solved some collective action problems;
it only makes sense that you can't hunt mastodons
while you're fighting with the other groups.
but it's clear that a new form of wealth must have emerged.
More protein than a hunter's family could eat before it rotted.
So that raised a social question
that I believe must have driven new social forms.
Did the people who ate that mastodon meat owe something
to the hunters and their families?
And if so, how did they make arrangements?
Again, we can't know, but we can be pretty sure that some form of
symbolic communication must have been involved.
the first cities built of mud and brick, the first empires.
And it was the administers of these empires
who began hiring people to keep track of the wheat and sheep and wine that was owed
and the taxes that was owed on them
by making marks; marks on clay in that time.
And this powerful tool was really reserved, for thousands of years,
for the elite administrators (Laughter) who kept track of accounts for the empires.
And then another communication technology enabled new media:
the printing press came along, and within decades,
millions of people became literate.
And from literate populations,
new forms of collective action emerged in the spheres of knowledge,
religion and politics.
We saw scientific revolutions, the Protestant Reformation,
constitutional democracies possible where they had not been possible before.
Not created by the printing press,
but enabled by the collective action that emerges from literacy.
And again, new forms of wealth emerged.
But capitalism, as we know it, is only a few hundred years old,
enabled by cooperative arrangements and technologies,
such as the joint-stock ownership company,
shared liability insurance, double-entry bookkeeping.
and in the many-to-many era, every desktop is now a printing press,
a broadcasting station, a community or a marketplace.
Evolution is speeding up.
More recently, that power is untethering and leaping off the desktops,
and very, very quickly, we're going to see a significant proportion, if not the majority of
the human race, walking around holding, carrying or wearing supercomputers
linked at speeds greater
than what we consider to be broadband today.
the considerable literature on it is based on what sociologists call "social dilemmas."
And there are a couple of mythic narratives of social dilemmas.
I'm going to talk briefly about two of them:
the prisoner's dilemma and the tragedy of the commons.
he assured me that everybody in this audience pretty much knows the details
of the prisoner's dilemma,
so I'm just going to go over that very, very quickly.
If you have more questions about it, ask Kevin Kelly later. (Laughter)
on a mathematical matrix that came out of the game theory
in the early years of thinking about nuclear war:
two players who couldn't trust each other.
Let me just say that every unsecured transaction
is a good example of a prisoner's dilemma.
Person with the goods, person with the money,
because they can't trust each other, are not going to exchange.
Neither one wants to be the first one
or they're going to get the sucker's payoff,
but both lose, of course, because they don't get what they want.
If they could only agree, if they could only turn a prisoner's dilemma into
a different payoff matrix called an assurance game, they could proceed.
as a probe of the biological question:
if we are here because our ancestors were such fierce competitors,
how does cooperation exist at all?
He started a computer tournament for
people to submit prisoner's dilemma strategies and discovered,
much to his surprise, that a very, very simple strategy won --
it won the first tournament, and even after everyone knew it won,
it won the second tournament -- that's known as tit for tat.
is the ultimatum game,
and it's also a very interesting probe of
our assumptions about the way people make economic transactions.
Here's how the game is played: there are two players;
they've never played the game before,
they will not play the game again, they don't know each other,
and they are, in fact, in separate rooms.
First player is offered a hundred dollars
and is asked to propose a split: 50/50, 90/10,
whatever that player wants to propose. The second player either accepts the split --
both players are paid and the game is over --
or rejects the split -- neither player is paid and the game is over.
would tell you it's irrational to reject a dollar
because someone you don't know in another room is going to get 99.
Yet in thousands of trials with American and European and Japanese students,
a significant percentage would reject any offer that's not close to 50/50.
And although they were screened and didn't know about the game
and had never played the game before,
proposers seemed to innately know this
because the average proposal was surprisingly close to 50/50.
when anthropologists began taking this game to other cultures
and discovered, to their surprise,
that slash-and-burn agriculturalists in the Amazon
or nomadic pastoralists in Central Asia or a dozen different cultures --
each had radically different ideas of what is fair.
Which suggests that instead of there being an innate sense of fairness,
that somehow the basis of our economic
transactions can be influenced by our social institutions,
whether we know that or not.
Garrett Hardin used it to talk about overpopulation in the late 1960s.
He used the example of a common grazing area in which each person
by simply maximizing their own flock
led to overgrazing and the depletion of the resource.
He had the rather gloomy conclusion that
humans will inevitably despoil any common pool resource
in which people cannot be restrained from using it.
1990 asked the interesting question that any good scientist should ask,
which is: is it really true that humans will always despoil commons?
So she went out and looked at what data she could find.
She looked at thousands of cases of humans sharing watersheds,
forestry resources, fisheries, and discovered that yes, in case after case,
humans destroyed the commons that they depended on.
But she also found many instances in which people escaped the prisoner's dilemma;
in fact, the tragedy of the commons is a multiplayer prisoner's dilemma.
And she said that people are only prisoners if they consider themselves to be.
They escape by creating institutions for collective action.
And she discovered, I think most interestingly,
that among those institutions that worked,
there were a number of common design
principles, and those principles seem to be
missing from those institutions that don't work.
disciplines. In biology, the notions of symbiosis,
group selection, evolutionary psychology are contested, to be sure.
But there is really no longer any major debate over the fact that
cooperative arrangements have moved from a peripheral role to a central role
in biology, from the level of the cell to the level of the ecology.
And again, our notions of individuals as economic beings
have been overturned.
Rational self-interest is not always the dominating factor.
In fact, people will act to punish cheaters, even at a cost to themselves.
have shown that people who punish cheaters in economic games
show activity in the reward centers of their brain.
Which led one scientist to declare that altruistic punishment
may be the glue that holds societies together.
in the past have helped create new economic forms.
Commerce is ancient. Markets are very old. Capitalism is fairly recent;
socialism emerged as a reaction to that.
And yet we see very little talk about how the next form may be emerging.
Jim Surowiecki briefly mentioned Yochai Benkler's paper about open source,
pointing to a new form of production: peer-to-peer production.
I simply want you to keep in mind that if in the past, new forms of cooperation
enabled by new technologies create new forms of wealth,
we may be moving into yet another economic form
that is significantly different from previous ones.
some of the most fierce competitors in the IT world are open sourcing
their software, are providing portfolios of patents for the commons.
Eli Lilly -- in, again, the fiercely competitive pharmaceutical world --
has created a market for solutions for pharmaceutical problems.
Toyota, instead of treating its suppliers as a marketplace,
treats them as a network and trains them to produce better,
even though they are also training them to produce better for their competitors.
Now none of these companies are doing this out of altruism;
they're doing it because they're learning that
a certain kind of sharing is in their self-interest.
can be created with neither the bureaucratic structure of the firm
nor the incentives of the marketplace as we've known them.
Google enriches itself by enriching thousands of bloggers through AdSense.
Amazon has opened its Application Programming Interface
to 60,000 developers, countless Amazon shops.
They're enriching others, not out of altruism but as a way of enriching themselves.
eBay solved the prisoner's dilemma and created a market
where none would have existed by creating a feedback mechanism
that turns a prisoner's dilemma game into an assurance game.
it's, "You prove to me that you are trustworthy and I will cooperate."
Wikipedia has used thousands of volunteers to create a free encyclopedia
with a million and a half articles in 200 languages in just a couple of years.
to put up problems to be solved by design students around the world,
including something that's being used for tsunami relief right now:
it's a mechanism for rehydrating
cholera victims that's so simple to use it,
illiterates can be trained to use it.
BitTorrent turns every downloader into an uploader,
making the system more efficient the more it is used.
when they're not using them to link together through the Internet
into supercomputing collectives
that help solve the protein folding problem for medical researchers --
that's Folding@home at Stanford --
to crack codes, to search for life in outer space.
I don't think we've even begun to discover what the basic principles are,
but I think we can begin to think about them.
And I don't have enough time to talk about all of them,
but think about self-interest.
This is all about self-interest that adds up to more.
In El Salvador, both sides that withdrew from their civil war
took moves that had been proven to mirror a prisoner's dilemma strategy.
citizens have self-organized political protests and
get out the vote campaigns using mobile devices and SMS.
Is an Apollo Project of cooperation possible?
A transdisciplinary study of cooperation?
I believe that the payoff would be very big.
I think we need to begin developing maps of this territory
so that we can talk about it across disciplines.
And I am not saying that understanding cooperation
is going to cause us to be better people --
and sometimes people cooperate to do bad things --
but I will remind you that a few hundred years ago,
people saw their loved ones die from diseases they thought
were caused by sin or foreigners or evil spirits.
When the scientific method provided that new way of thinking
and biology showed that microorganisms caused disease,
suffering was alleviated.
What forms of suffering could be alleviated,
what forms of wealth could be created
if we knew a little bit more about cooperation?
I don't think that this transdisciplinary discourse
is automatically going to happen;
it's going to require effort.
So I enlist you to help me get the cooperation project started.
Thank you.
and perhaps in the next 10,000 years.
But I want to start with my work on romantic love,
because that's my most recent work.
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people, who were madly in love,
into a functional MRI brain scanner.
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted;
and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped.
and then go on into where I think love is going.
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was
by looking at the last 45 years of the psychological research
a person begins to take on what I call, "special meaning."
"The world had a new center, and that center was Mary Anne."
but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do.
As Chaucer said, "Love is blind."
I decided I would read poetry from all over the world,
And in this case, a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat.
As one Polynesian said, "I felt like jumping in the sky."
You know, if you're just sleeping with somebody casually,
It would be nice to go to bed with them,
but you want them to call you on the telephone, to invite you out, etc.,
The motor in the brain begins to crank, and you want this person.
Before I put these people in the MRI machine,
I would ask them all kinds of questions.
But my most important question was always the same.
I would always have to work myself up to this question,
because I'm not a psychologist.
I don't work with people in any kind of traumatic situation.
My final question was always the same.
I would say, "Would you die for him or her?"
and when it was in a resting state.
the wanting part of the mind, the craving part of the mind.
The kind of part of the mind
for both great joy and great sorrow.
One is the sex drive: the craving for sexual gratification.
W.H. Auden called it an "intolerable neural itch,"
and indeed, that's what it is.
that elation, obsession of early love.
And the third brain system is attachment:
that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner.
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy
on just one individual at a time,
that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems:
lust, romantic love and deep attachment to a partner.
sometimes very, very slowly, but they are moving into the job market --
and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal.
The double income family was the standard.
In short, we're really moving forward to the past.
they're moving back into the job market.
In short, they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago,
I'll say just a couple of things, and then go on to sex and love.
There's a lot of gender differences;
I don't know why they want to think that men and women are alike.
"I think that we are like two feet. We need each other to get ahead."
But we did not evolve to have the same brain.
And we're finding more and more gender differences in the brain.
I'll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love.
Women can talk.
They held that baby in front of their face,
where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market,
they're moving into journalism.
And I think that the television is like the global campfire.
We sit around it and it shapes our minds.
Almost always, when I'm on TV, the producer who calls me,
They've got incredible people skills, negotiating skills.
They're highly imaginative.
They're both perfectly good ways of thinking.
We need both of them to get ahead.
In fact, there's many more male geniuses in the world.
I'm always astonished when people come to me and say,
In the Western world,
women start sooner at sex, have more partners,
express less remorse for the partners that they do,
that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago,
because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see
in hunting and gathering societies today.
They're now saying that the 21st century
is going to be the century of what they call the "symmetrical marriage,"
or the "pure marriage," or the "companionate marriage."
This is a marriage between equals,
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men
because of the second great world trend.
The first one being women moving into the job market,
the second one being the aging world population.
They're now saying that in America,
that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85.
So we're seeing there's a real extension of middle age.
And as it turns out, the older you get, the less likely you are to divorce.
and it's actually beginning to decline.
-- women have never been as interesting as they are now.
those are associated with attachment.
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody
after you've made love to them.
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner
while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else,
while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners.
In short, we're capable of loving more than one person at a time.
to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else.
It's as if there's a committee meeting going on in your head
as you are trying to decide what to do.
we are an animal that was built to reproduce.
And these drugs are going generic.
They are seeping around the world.
SSRIs, serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13.
She's 23. She's been on them ever since she was 13.
when they're going through something horrible.
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else.
I would recommend it.
And when you kill the sex drive, you kill orgasm.
I'm just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place.
and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them.
I said, "I don't know anything about personality. You know?
I don't know. Do you think you've got the right person?"
They said, "Yes."
And that's what I'm now contributing to this.
I've been carrying on here about the biology of love.
the magic of it.
Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook.
That's where we put our people in the MRI machine.
And they were all at a conference in Beijing.

And, "Wasn't that rickshaw driver handsome!"
a short, brief journey of life through time.
Thank you. It's really an honor and a privilege to be here
spending my last day as a teenager.
Today I want to talk to you about the future, but
first I'm going to tell you a bit about the past.
My story starts way before I was born.
My grandmother was on a train to Auschwitz, the death camp.
And she was going along the tracks, and the tracks split.
And somehow -- we don't really know exactly the whole story -- but
the train took the wrong track and went to a work camp rather than the death camp.
My grandmother survived and married my grandfather.
They were living in Hungary, and my mother was born.
And when my mother was two years old,
the Hungarian revolution was raging, and they decided to escape Hungary.
They got on a boat, and yet another divergence --
the boat was either going to Canada or to Australia.
They got on and didn't know where they were going, and ended up in Canada.
So, to make a long story short, they came to Canada.
My grandmother was a chemist. She worked at the Banting Institute in Toronto,
and at 44 she died of stomach cancer. I never met my grandmother,
but I carry on her name -- her exact name, Eva Vertes --
My family was on a road trip and we were in the Grand Canyon.
And I had never been a reader when I was young --
my dad had tried me with the Hardy Boys; I tried Nancy Drew;
I tried all that -- and I just didn't like reading books.
And my mother bought this book when we were at the Grand Canyon
called "The Hot Zone." It was all about the outbreak of the Ebola virus.
And something about it just kind of drew me towards it.
and as we drove from the edge of the Grand Canyon
to Big Sur, and to, actually, here where we are today, in Monterey,
I read that book, and from when I was reading that book,
I knew that I wanted to have a life in medicine.
I wanted to be like the explorers I'd read about in the book,
who went into the jungles of Africa,
went into the research labs and just tried to figure out
what this deadly virus was. So from that moment on, I read every medical book
I could get my hands on, and I just loved it so much.
"Maybe now, you know -- being a big high school kid --
I can maybe become an active part of this big medical world."
But I mean, why would they respond to a 14-year-old, anyway?
At that time, I was really interested in neuroscience
and wanted to do a research project in neurology --
specifically looking at the effects of heavy metals on the developing nervous system.
So I started that, and worked in his lab for a year,
and found the results that I guess you'd expect to find
when you feed fruit flies heavy metals -- that it really, really impaired the nervous system.
The spinal cord had breaks. The neurons were crossing in every which way.
And from then I wanted to look not at impairment, but at prevention of impairment.
and tried to familiarize myself with the research,
and at the same time when I was in the --
I was reading in the medical library one day, and I read this article
about something called "purine derivatives."
And they seemed to have cell growth-promoting properties.
And being naive about the whole field, I kind of thought,
"Oh, you have cell death in Alzheimer's
which is causing the memory deficit, and then you have this compound --
purine derivatives -- that are promoting cell growth."
And so I thought, "Maybe if it can promote cell growth,
it can inhibit cell death, too."
And so that's the project that I pursued for that year,
and it's continuing now as well,
and found that a specific purine derivative called "guanidine"
had inhibited the cell growth by approximately 60 percent.
So I presented those results at the International Science Fair,
which was just one of the most amazing experiences of my life.
And there I was awarded "Best in the World in Medicine,"
which allowed me to get in, or at least get a foot in the door of the big medical world.
I wanted to explore it all. I wanted it all at once, but knew I couldn't really get that.
And I stumbled across something called "cancer stem cells."
I didn't really know how to put the two together. I'd heard of stem cells,
and I'd heard of them as the panacea of the future --
the therapy of many diseases to come in the future, perhaps.
But I'd heard of cancer as the most feared disease of our time,
so how did the good and bad go together?
Last summer I worked at Stanford University, doing some research on cancer stem cells.
And while I was doing this, I was reading the cancer literature,
trying to -- again -- familiarize myself with this new medical field.
And it seemed that tumors actually begin from a stem cell.
This fascinated me. The more I read, the more I looked at cancer differently
If you smoke, you damage your lung tissue, and then lung cancer arises.
If you drink, you damage your liver, and then liver cancer occurs.
And it was really interesting -- there were articles correlating
if you have a bone fracture, and then bone cancer arises.
Because what stem cells are -- they're these
phenomenal cells that really have the ability to differentiate
into any type of tissue.
So, if the body is sensing that you have damage to an organ
and then it's initiating cancer, it's almost as if this is a repair response.
And the cancer, the body is saying the lung tissue is damaged,
we need to repair the lung. And cancer is originating in the lung
trying to repair -- because you have this excessive proliferation
of these remarkable cells that really have the potential to become lung tissue.
But it's almost as if the body has originated this ingenious response,
but can't quite control it.
It hasn't yet become fine-tuned enough to finish what has been initiated.
So this really, really fascinated me.
If we eliminate cancer the way we're trying to do now, with chemotherapy and radiation,
we're bombarding the body or the cancer with toxins, or with radiation, trying to kill it.
It's almost as if we're getting back to this starting point.
We're removing the cancer cells, but we're revealing the previous damage
that the body has tried to fix.
Shouldn't we think about manipulation, rather than elimination?
If somehow we can cause these cells to differentiate --
to become bone tissue, lung tissue, liver tissue,
whatever that cancer has been put there to do --
it would be a repair process. We'd end up better than we were before cancer.
So, this really changed my view of looking at cancer.
And while I was reading all these articles about cancer,
it seemed that the articles -- a lot of them -- focused on, you know,
the genetics of breast cancer, and the genesis
and the progression of breast cancer --
tracking the cancer through the body, tracing where it is, where it goes.
or cancer of any skeletal muscle for that matter.
"Well, maybe there's some obvious explanation
why skeletal muscle doesn't get cancer -- at least not that I know of."
So, I looked further into it, found as many articles as I could,
and it was amazing -- because it turned out that it was very rare.
Some articles even went as far as to say that skeletal muscle tissue
is resistant to cancer, and furthermore, not only to cancer,
but of metastases going to skeletal muscle.
And what metastases are is when the tumor --
when a piece -- breaks off and travels through the blood stream
and goes to a different organ. That's what a metastasis is.
It's the part of cancer that is the most dangerous.
but cancer didn't seem to go to skeletal muscle --
there seemed to be something here.
So these articles were saying, you know, "Skeletal --
metastasis to skeletal muscle -- is very rare."
But it was left at that. No one seemed to be asking why.
was I emailed some professors who
specialized in skeletal muscle physiology, and pretty much said,
"Hey, it seems like cancer doesn't really go to skeletal muscle.
Is there a reason for this?" And a lot of the replies I got were that
muscle is terminally differentiated tissue.
Meaning that you have muscle cells, but they're not dividing,
so it doesn't seem like a good target for cancer to hijack.
But then again, this fact that the metastases
didn't go to skeletal muscle made that seem unlikely.
And furthermore, that nervous tissue -- brain -- gets cancer,
and brain cells are also terminally differentiated.
So I decided to ask why. And here's some of, I guess, my hypotheses
that I'll be starting to investigate this May at the Sylvester Cancer Institute in Miami.
And I guess I'll keep investigating until I get the answers.
But I know that in science, once you get the answers,
when you first think about skeletal muscle,
there's a lot of blood vessels going to skeletal muscle.
And the first thing that makes me think is that
blood vessels are like highways for the tumor cells.
the more likely it is to get cancer or to get metastases.
So first of all I thought, you know, "Wouldn't it be favorable
to cancer getting to skeletal muscle?" And as well,
cancer tumors require a process called angiogenesis,
which is really, the tumor recruits the blood vessels to itself
to supply itself with nutrients so it can grow.
Without angiogenesis, the tumor remains the size of a pinpoint and it's not harmful.
So angiogenesis is really a central process to the pathogenesis of cancer.
to skeletal muscle upon autopsy.
16 percent! Meaning that there were these pinpoint tumors in skeletal muscle,
but only .16 percent of actual metastases --
suggesting that maybe skeletal muscle is able to control the angiogenesis,
is able to control the tumors recruiting these blood vessels.
We use skeletal muscles so much. It's the one portion of our body --
our heart's always beating. We're always moving our muscles.
Is it possible that muscle somehow intuitively knows
that it needs this blood supply? It needs to be constantly contracting,
so therefore it's almost selfish. It's grabbing its blood vessels for itself.
Therefore, when a tumor comes into skeletal muscle tissue,
it can't get a blood supply, and can't grow.
in skeletal muscle -- or perhaps even more,
an angiogenic routing factor, so it can actually direct where the blood vessels grow --
this could be a potential future therapy for cancer.
And another thing that's really interesting is that
there's this whole -- the way tumors move throughout the body,
it's a very complex system -- and there's something called the chemokine network.
And chemokines are essentially chemical attractants,
and they're the stop and go signals for cancer.
So a tumor expresses chemokine receptors,
and another organ -- a distant organ somewhere in the body --
will have the corresponding chemokines,
and the tumor will see these chemokines and migrate towards it.
Is it possible that skeletal muscle doesn't express this type of molecules?
And the other really interesting thing is that
when skeletal muscle -- there's been several reports that when skeletal
muscle is injured, that's what correlates with metastases going to skeletal muscle.
that's what causes chemokines -- these signals saying,
"Cancer, you can come to me," the "go signs" for the tumors --
it causes them to highly express these chemokines.
for why tumors don't go to skeletal muscle.
But it seems like by investigating, by attacking cancer,
by searching where cancer is not, there has got to be something --
there's got to be something -- that's making this tissue resistant to tumors.
And can we utilize -- can we take this property,
this compound, this receptor, whatever it is that's controlling these
anti-tumor properties and apply it to cancer therapy in general?
Now, one thing that kind of ties the resistance of skeletal muscle to cancer --
to the cancer as a repair response gone out of control in the body --
is that skeletal muscle has a factor in it called "MyoD."
And what MyoD essentially does is, it causes cells to differentiate
actually convert this variety of cell types into skeletal muscle cells.
So, is it possible that the tumor cells are going to the skeletal muscle tissue,
but once in contact inside the skeletal muscle tissue,
MyoD acts upon these tumor cells and causes them
to become skeletal muscle cells?
Muscle is constantly being used -- constantly being damaged.
If every time we tore a muscle
or every time we stretched a muscle or moved in a wrong way,
cancer occurred -- I mean, everybody would have cancer almost.
And I hate to say that. But it seems as though muscle cell,
and we need to restore new brain cells, new functional brain cells --
thank you very much.
Stephanie White: I'm going to let her introduce herself to everybody.
Can you tell everybody your name?
(Laughter)
Since we've arrived, there's been a constant buzz
about all the exciting speakers here for the conference.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
is that maybe he'll genetically engineer a five-pound peanut.
E: [Spaceship noise]
(Laughter)
Now, Einstein also thinks, you know,
E: [Bobbing head] (Laughter)
SW: Let's get down for everybody. Come on now.
She's going to make me do it, too. Ooh, ooh.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Or maybe Stu just needs another backup singer?
Einstein, can you also sing?
I know, you need to get rid of that seed first. Can you sing?
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
she knows that his birthday is coming up at the end of March.
And we didn't think he'd be in town then,
so Einstein wanted to do something special for him.
So let's see if Einstein will sing "Happy Birthday" to Al Gore.
Can you sing "Happy Birthday" to him?
(Applause)
Well, before we wrap it up, she would like to give a shout out
to all our animal friends back at the Knoxville Zoo.
Einstein, do you want to say "hi" to all the owls?
SW: There we go.
(Laughter)
Let's get that one out of there. How about a chimpanzee?
(Laughter)
What about a wolf?
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Well, we would like to encourage all of you
to do your part to help protect Einstein's animal friends,
and to do your part to help protect their homes that they live [in].
(Applause)
Walk around for four months with three wishes,
and all the ideas will start to percolate up.
I think everybody should do it -- think that you've got three wishes.
And what would you do? It's actually a great exercise
to really drill down to the things that you feel are important,
and really reflect on the world around us.
And thinking that, can an individual actually do something,
or come up with something,
that may actually get some traction out there and make a difference?
Inspired by nature -- that's the theme here.
And I think, quite frankly, that's where I started.
We have this Great North. And there was a pretty small population,
and my father was an avid outdoorsman.
So I really had a chance to experience that.
And I could never really understand exactly what it was, or how it was informing me.
But what I think it was telling me
is that we are this transient thing that's happening,
and that the nature that you see out there -- the untouched shorelines,
the untouched forest that I was able to see --
really bring in a sense of that geological time,
that this has gone on for a long time,
and we're experiencing it in a different way.
to be able to make the work that I did.
And I did go out, and I did this picture of grasses coming through in the spring,
along a roadside.
This rebirth of grass. And then I went out for years
trying to photograph the pristine landscape.
But as a fine-art photographer I somehow felt
that it wouldn't catch on out there,
that there would be a problem with trying to make this as a fine-art career.
And I kept being sucked into this genre of the calendar picture,
or something of that nature, and I couldn't get away from it.
So I started to think of, how can I rethink the landscape?
I decided to rethink the landscape
as the landscape that we've transformed.
and I took a left turn trying to get back to the highway.
And I ended up in a town called Frackville.
I got out of the car, and I stood up,
and it was a coal-mining town. I did a 360 turnaround,
and that became one of the most surreal landscapes I've ever seen.
Totally transformed by man.
And that got me to go out and look at mines like this,
and go out and look at the largest industrial incursions
in the landscape that I could find.
And that became the baseline of what I was doing.
And it also became the theme that I felt that I could hold onto,
and not have to re-invent myself --
that this theme was large enough to become a life's work,
to become something that I could sink my teeth into
and just research and find out where these industries are.
which I kind of missed,
was to thank all the corporations who helped me get in.
Because it took negotiation for almost every one of these photographs --
to get into that place to make those photographs,
and if it wasn't for those people letting me in
at the heads of those corporations,
I would have never made this body of work.
So in that respect, to me, I'm not against the corporation.
I own a corporation. I work with them,
and I feel that we all need them and they're important.
But I am also for sustainability.
And I'm not making an indictment towards what's happening here,
but it is a slow progression.
So I started thinking, well, we live in all these ages of man:
the Stone Age, and the Iron Age, and the Copper Age.
And these ages of man are still at work today.
But we've become totally disconnected from them.
There's something that we're not seeing there.
And it's a scary thing as well. Because when we start looking
at the collective appetite for our lifestyles,
and what we're doing to that landscape --
that, to me, is something that is a very sobering moment for me to contemplate.
I'm hoping to be able to engage the audiences of my work,
and to come up to it and not immediately be rejected by the image.
Not to say, "Oh my God, what is it?" but to be challenged by it --
to say, "Wow, this is beautiful," on one level,
but on the other level, "This is scary. I shouldn't be enjoying it."
Like a forbidden pleasure. And it's that forbidden pleasure
that I think is what resonates out there,
and it gets people to look at these things,
and it gets people to enter it. And it also, in a way, defines kind of what I feel, too --
that I'm drawn to have a good life.
I want a house, and I want a car.
But there's this consequence out there.
And how do I begin to have that attraction, repulsion?
It's even in my own conscience I'm having it,
and here in my work, I'm trying to build that same toggle.
had 45 million tires in it. It was the largest one.
It was only about an hour-and-a-half away from me, and it caught fire
about four years ago. It's around Westley, California, around Modesto.
And I decided to start looking at something that, to me, had --
if the earlier work of looking at the landscape
had a sense of lament to what we were doing to nature,
in the recycling work that you're seeing here
was starting to point to a direction. To me, it was our redemption.
That in the recycling work that I was doing,
I'm looking for a practice, a human activity that is sustainable.
That if we keep putting things, through industrial and urban existence,
back into the system --
if we keep doing that -- we can continue on.
Of course, listening at the conference,
there's many, many things that are coming. Bio-mimicry,
and there's many other things that are coming on stream --
nanotechnology that may also prevent us from having
to go into that landscape and tear it apart.
And we all look forward to those things.
These things are continuing to happen.
What you're looking at here -- I went to Bangladesh,
so I started to move away from North America;
I started to look at our world globally.
These images of Bangladesh
came out of a radio program I was listening to.
They were talking about Exxon Valdez,
and that there was going to be a glut of oil tankers
because of the insurance industries.
And that those oil tankers needed to be decommissioned,
and 2004 was going to be the pinnacle.
And I thought, "My God, wouldn't that be something?"
To see the largest vessels of man being deconstructed by hand,
literally, in third-world countries.
So originally I was going to go to India.
And I was shut out of India because of a Greenpeace situation there,
and then I was able to get into Bangladesh,
and saw for the first time a third world, a view of it,
that I had never actually thought was possible.
130 million people living in an area the size of Wisconsin --
people everywhere -- the pollution was intense,
and the working conditions were horrible.
some of the biggest oil fields. And again, I started to think that --
there was another epiphany --
that the whole world I was living in was
a result of having plentiful oil.
And that, to me, was again something that I started building on,
and I continued to build on.
So this is a series I'm hoping to have ready
in about two or three years,
under the heading of "The Oil Party."
Because I think everything that we're involved in --
our clothing, our cars, our roads, and everything -- are directly a result.
I'm going to move to some pictures of China.
And for me China -- I started photographing it four years ago,
and China truly is a question of sustainability in my mind,
has a great effect on the industries that I grew up around.
I came out of a blue-collar town,
a GM town, and my father worked at GM,
so I was very familiar with that kind of industry
and that also informed my work. But you know,
to see China and the scale at which it's evolving, is quite something.
So what you see here is the Three Gorges Dam,
and this is the largest dam by 50 percent ever attempted by man.
Most of the engineers around the world left the project
because they said, "It's just too big."
In fact, when it did actually fill with water a year and a half ago,
they were able to measure a wobble within the earth as it was spinning.
It took fifteen days to fill it.
So this created a reservoir 600 kilometers long,
one of the largest reservoirs ever created.
And what was also one of the bigger projects around that
was moving 13 full-size cities up out of the reservoir,
and flattening all the buildings so they could make way for the ships.
And this is like 10 weeks later, demolished by hand.
I think 11 of the buildings they used dynamite,
everything else was by hand. That was 10 weeks later.
And this gives you an idea.
And it was all the people who lived in those homes,
were the ones that were actually taking it apart
and working, and getting paid per brick to take their cities apart.
And these are some of the images from that.
So I spent about three trips to the Three Gorges Dam,
looking at that massive transformation of a landscape.
And it looks like a bombed-out landscape, but it isn't.
What it is, it's a landscape that is an intentional one.
This is a need for power, and they're willing to go through this
massive transformation, on this scale, to get that power.
because I think on the table right now,
there's 27 nuclear power stations to be built.
There hasn't been one built in North America for 20 years
because of the "NIMBY" problem -- "Not In My BackYard."
But in China they're saying, "No, we're putting in 27 in the next 10 years."
And coal-burning furnaces are going in there
for hydroelectric power literally weekly.
So coal itself is probably one of the largest problems.
And one of the other things that happened in the Three Gorges --
a lot of the agricultural land that you see there on the left was also lost;
some of the most fertile agricultural land was lost in that.
And 1.2 to 2 million people were relocated,
depending on whose statistics you're looking at.
And this is what they were building.
This is the town hall for the city.
And again, the rebuilding of the city -- to me, it was sad to see
that they didn't really grab a lot of, I guess,
what we know here, in terms of urban planning.
There were no parks; there were no green spaces.
Very high-density living on the side of a hill.
And here they had a chance to rebuild cities from the bottom up,
but somehow were not connecting with them.
Build our science, civilized and advanced idea of marriage and giving birth."
So here, if you look at this poster,
it has all the trappings of Western culture.
You're seeing the tuxedos, the bouquets.
But what's really, to me, frightening about the picture
and about this billboard is the refinery in the background.
So it's like marrying up all the things that we have
and it's an adaptation of our way of life, full stop.
And again, when you start seeing that kind of embrace,
and you start looking at them leading their rural lifestyle
with a very, very small footprint and moving into an urban lifestyle
with a much higher footprint, it starts to become very sobering.
and this is where a lot of migrant workers are coming in from the country.
And there's about 130 million people in migration
trying to get into urban centers at all times,
and in the next 10 to 15 years, are expecting
another 400 to 500 million people to migrate
into the urban centers like Shanghai and the manufacturing centers.
The manufacturers are --
the domestics are usually -- you can tell a domestic factory by the fact
that they all use the same color uniforms.
So this is a pink uniform at this factory. It's a shoe factory.
And they have dorms for the workers.
So they bring them in from the country and put them up in the dorms.
near Shenzhen. It has 90,000 employees making shoes.
This is a shift change, one of three.
There's two factories of this scale in the same town.
This is one with 45,000, so every lunch,
there's about 12,000 coming through for lunch.
They sit down; they have about 20 minutes.
The next round comes in. It's an incredible workforce
that's building there. Shanghai --
I'm looking at the urban renewal in Shanghai,
and this is a whole area that will be flattened
and turned into skyscrapers in the next five years.
China is changing because this wouldn't have happened
five years ago, for instance. This is a holdout.
They're called dengzahoos -- they're like pin tacks to the ground.
They won't move. They're not negotiating.
They're not getting enough, so they're not going to move.
And so they're holding off until they get a deal with them.
And they've been actually quite successful in getting better deals
because most of them are getting a raw deal.
They're being put out about two hours --
the communities that have been around for literally hundreds of years,
or maybe even thousands of years,
are being broken up and spread across in the suburban areas
outside of Shanghai. But these are a whole series of guys
holding out in this reconstruction of Shanghai.
Probably the largest urban-renewal project, I think,
ever attempted on the planet.
again, one of my wishes, and I never ended up going there,
was to somehow tell them that there were better ways to build a house.
The kinds of collisions of styles and things were quite something,
and these are called the villas.
And also, like right now, they're just moving.
The scaffolding is still on, and this is an e-waste area,
and if you looked in the foreground on the big print,
you'd see that the industry -- their industry -- they're all recycling.
So the industry's already growing
around these new developments.
Shanghai was a very intriguing city -- it's exploding on a level
that I don't think any city has experienced.
In fact, even Shenzhen, the economic zone --
one of the first ones -- 15 years ago was about 100,000 people,
and today it boasts about 10 to 11 million.
So that gives you an idea of the kinds of migrations and the speed with which --
this is just the taxis being built by Volkswagen.
There's 9,000 of them here,
and they're being built for most of the big cities,
Beijing and Shanghai, Shenzhen.
And this isn't even the domestic car market; this is the taxi market.
And what we would see here as a suburban development --
a similar thing, but they're all high-rises.
So they'll put 20 or 40 up at a time,
and they just go up in the same way
as a single-family dwelling would go up here in an area.
And one of the things in this picture that I wanted to point out
is that when I saw these kinds of buildings,
I was shocked to see
that they're not using a central air-conditioning system;
every window has an air conditioner in it.
And I'm sure there are people here who probably
know better than I do about efficiencies,
but I can't imagine that every apartment having its own air conditioner
is a very efficient way to cool a building on this scale.
And when you start looking at that,
and then you start factoring up into a city the size of Shanghai,
it's literally a forest of skyscrapers.
It's breathtaking, in terms of the speed at which this city is transforming.
And you can see in the foreground of this picture,
it's still one of the last areas that was being held up.
Right now that's all cleared out -- this was done about eight months ago --
and high-rises are now going up into that central spot.
So a skyscraper is built, literally, overnight in Shanghai.
at some of the biggest industries in China.
And this is Baosteel, right outside of Shanghai.
This is the coal supply for the steel factory -- 18 square kilometers.
It's an incredibly massive operation, I think 15,000 workers,
five cupolas, and the sixth one's coming in here.
So they're building very large blast furnaces
to try to deal with the demand for steel in China.
So this is three of the visible blast furnaces within that shot.
And again, looking at these images, there's this constant, like, haze that you're seeing.
This is going to show you, real time, an assembler. It's a circuit breaker.
10 hours a day at this speed.
I think one of the issues
that we here are facing with China,
is that they're using a lot of the latest production technology.
And I asked the manager to point out five of your fastest producers,
and then I went and looked at each one of them for about 15 or 20 minutes,
and picked this one woman.
And it was just lightning fast;
the way she was working was almost unbelievable.
But that is the trick that they've got right now,
that they're winning with, is that they're using
all the latest technologies and extrusion machines,
and bringing all the components into play,
but the assembly is where they're actually bringing in --
the country workers are very willing to work. They want to work.
There's a massive backlog of people wanting their jobs.
That condition's going to be there for the next 10 to 15 years
if they realize what they want, which is, you know,
400 to 500 million more people coming into the cities.
this is a shot of it.
I had to use a very small aperture to get the depth of field.
I had to have them freeze for 10 seconds to get this shot.
It took me five fake tries
because they were just going. To slow them down was literally impossible.
They were just wound up doing these things all day long,
until the manager had to, with a stern voice, say,
"Okay, everybody freeze."
It wasn't too bad,
but they're driven to produce these things at an incredible rate.
And what you're seeing here is,
again, one of the most state-of-the-art textile mills.
There are 500 of these machines; they're worth about 200,000 dollars each.
So you have about 12 people running this,
and they're just inspecting it -- and they're just walking the lines.
The machines are all running,
absolutely incredible to see what the scale of industries are.
And I started getting in further and further into the factories.
And that's a diptych. I do a lot of pairings
to try and get the sense of scale in these places.
This is a line where they get the threads
and they wind the threads together,
pre-going into the textile mills.
which is the making of shoes.
This floor has about 1,500 workers on this floor.
The company itself had about 10,000 employees,
and they're doing domestic shoes.
It was very hard to get into the international companies
because I had to get permission from companies like Nike and Adidas,
and that's very hard to get.
And they don't want to let me in.
But the domestic was much easier to do.
It just gives you a sense of, again -- and that's where,
really, the whole migration of jobs started going over to China
and making the shoes. Nike was one of the early ones.
It was such a high labor component to it
that it made a lot of sense to go after that labor market.
one of the largest mobile makers in China.
I think mobile phone companies
are popping up, literally, on a weekly basis,
and they have an explosive growth in mobile phones.
This is a textile where they're doing shirts --
Youngor, the biggest shirt factory and clothing factory in China.
And this next shot here is one of the lunchrooms.
Everything is very efficient.
While setting up this shot,
people on average would spend eight to 10 minutes having a lunch.
This was one of the biggest factories I've ever seen.
They make coffeemakers here, the biggest coffeemaker
and the biggest iron makers --
they make 20 million of them in the world.
There's 21,000 employees. This one factory -- and they had several of them --
is half a kilometer long.
These are just recently shot -- I just came back about a month ago,
so you're the first ones to be seeing these,
these new factory pictures I've taken.
The other aspect of what's happening in China
is that there's a real need for materials there.
So a lot of the recycled materials that are collected here
are being recycled and taken to China by ships.
That's cubed metal. This is armatures, electrical armatures,
where they're getting the copper and the high-end steel
from electrical motors out, and recycling them.
This is certainly connected to California and Silicon Valley.
But this is what happens to most of the computers.
Fifty percent of the world's computers end up in China to be recycled.
And it is a bit of a problem. The way they recycle the boards
is that they actually use the coal briquettes,
which are used all through China, but they heat up the boards,
and with pairs of pliers they pull off all the components.
They're trying to get all the valued metals out of those components.
But the toxic smells -- when you come into a town
that's actually doing this kind of burning of the boards,
you can smell it a good five or 10 kilometers before you get there.
Here's another operation. It's all cottage industries,
so it's not big places -- it's all in people's front porches,
in their backyards, even in their homes they're burning boards,
because it is considered in China to be illegal, doing it,
but they can't stop the product from coming in.
This portrait -- I'm not usually known for portraits,
but I couldn't resist this one, where she's been through Mao,
and she's been through the Great Leap Forward,
and the Cultural Revolution, and now she's sitting on her porch
with this e-waste beside her. It's quite something.
This is a road where it's been shored up by computer boards
in one of the biggest towns where they're recycling.
So that's the photographs that I wanted to show you.
They've been sitting on my shoulder the whole time while I've been thinking.
One's Megan, the one of the right, and Katja there.
And to me the whole notion --
the things I'm photographing are out of a great concern
about the scale of our progress and what we call progress.
And as much as there are great things around the corner --
and it's palpable in this room --
of all of the things that are just about to break
that can solve so many problems,
I'm really hoping that those things will spread around the world
and will start to have a positive effect.
And it isn't something that isn't just affecting our world,
but it starts to go up -- because I think we can start correcting
our footprint and bring it down -- but there's a growing footprint
that's happening in Asia, and is growing at a rapid, rapid rate,
and so I don't think we can equalize it. So ultimately the strategy,
I think, here is that we have to be very concerned about their evolution,
because it is going to be connected to our evolution as well.
is sitting with these thoughts in mind,
and thinking about,
"How is their life going to be when they want to have children,
or when they're ready to get married 20 years from now -- or whatever,
15 years from now?"
And to me that has been the core behind most of my thinking --
in my work, and also for this incredible chance to have some wishes.
Wish one: world-changing. I want to use my images
to persuade millions of people to join in the global conversation on sustainability.
And it is through communications today
that I believe that that is not an unreal idea.
Oh, and I went in search -- I wanted to put what I had in mind,
hitch it onto something. I didn't want a wish just to start from nowhere.
I wanted to find out what's going on that's working right now.
And Worldchanging.com is a fantastic blog, and that blog
is now being visited by close to half-a-million people a month.
And it just started about 14 months ago.
And the beauty of what's going on there
is that the tone of the conversation is the tone that I like.
What they're doing there is that they're not --
I think the environmental movement has failed
in that it's used the stick too much;
it's used the apocalyptic tone too much;
it hasn't sold the positive aspects of
being environmentally concerned and trying to pull us out.
Whereas this conversation that is going on in this blog
is about positive movements,
about how to change our world in a better way, quickly.
And it's looking at technology, and it's looking at new energy-saving devices,
and it's looking at how to rethink and how to re-strategize
the movement towards sustainability.
would be to put some of my work in the service of promoting
the Worldchanging.com website.
Some of you might know, he's a TEDster -- Stephen Sagmeister and I
are working on some layouts. And this is still in preliminary stages;
these aren't the finals. But these images, with Worldchanging.com,
can be placed into any kind of media.
They could be posted through the Web;
they could be used as a billboard or a bus shelter, or anything of that nature.
So we're looking at this as trying to build out.
And what we ended up discussing
was that in most media you get mostly an image with a lot of text,
and the text is blasted all over.
is less than five percent of ads are actually leading with image.
And so in this case,
because it's about a lot of these images and what they represent,
and the kinds of questions they bring up,
that we thought letting the images play out and bring someone to say,
"Well, what's Worldchanging.com, with these images, have to do?"
And hopefully inspire people to go to that website.
So Worldchanging.com, and building that blog, and it is a blog,
and I'm hoping that it isn't -- I don't see it as the kind of blog
where we're all going to follow each other to death.
This one is one that will spoke out, and will go out,
and to start reaching. Because right now there's conversations
in India, in China, in South America --
there's entries coming from all around the world.
I think there's a chance to have a dialogue, a conversation
about sustainability at Worldchanging.com.
And anything that you can do to promote that would be fantastic.
And this one is: I wish to launch a groundbreaking competition
that motivates kids to invest ideas on, and invent ideas on, sustainability.
And one of the things that came out --
Allison, who actually nominated me, said something earlier on
in a brainstorming. She said that recycling in Canada
had a fantastic entry into our psyche through kids between grade four and six.
And you think about it, you know,
grade four -- my wife and I, we say age seven is the age of reason,
so they're into the age of reason. And they're pre-puberty.
So it's this great window where they actually are --
you can influence them. You know what happens at puberty?
You know, we know that from earlier presentations.
to start driving home ideas. Let them understand what sustainability is,
and that they have a vested interest in it to happen.
And one of the ways I thought of doing it is to use my prize,
so I would take 30,000 or 40,000 dollars of the winnings,
and the rest is going to be to manage this project,
but to use that as prizes for kids to get into their hands.
But the other thing that I thought would be fantastic
was to create these -- call them "prize targets."
And so one could be for the best sustainable idea
for an in-school project, the best one for a household project,
or it could be the best community project for sustainability.
for the best artwork for "In My World." And what would happen --
it's a scalable thing. And if we can get people to put in things --
whether it's equipment, like a media lab,
or money to make the prize significant enough --
and to open it up to all the schools that are public schools,
or schools that are with kids that age,
and make it a wide-open competition for them
to go after those prizes and to submit them.
And the prize has to be a verifiable thing, so it's not about just ideas.
The art pieces are about the ideas and how they present them
and do them, but the actual things have to be verifiable.
In that way, what's happening is that
we're motivating a certain age group to start thinking.
And they're going to push that up, from the bottom -- up into,
I believe, into the households. And parents will be reacting to it,
and trying to help them with the projects.
in a very positive way,
and starts to teach them. They know about recycling now,
but they don't really, I think, get sustainability in all the things,
and the energy footprint, and how that matters.
And to teach them, to me, would be a fantastic wish,
and it would be something that I would certainly put my shoulder into.
And again, in "In My World," the competition --
we would use the artwork that comes in from that competition to promote it.
And I like the words, "in my world,"
because it gives possession of the world to the person who's doing it.
It is my world; it's not someone else's. I want to help it;
I want to do something with it. So I think it has a great opportunity
to engage the imaginations -- and great ideas, I think, come from kids --
and engage their imagination into a project,
and do something for schools.
I think all schools could use extra equipment, extra cash --
it's going to be an incentive for them to do that.
And these are some of the ideas in terms of where
we could possibly put in some promotion for "In My World."
and I've always wanted to actually get involved with doing something.
And the scale of my work, and the kinds of ideas I'm playing with --
when I first saw an Imax film, I almost immediately thought,
"There's a real resonance between what I'm trying to do
and the scale of what I try to do as a photographer."
And I think there's a real possibility
to reach new audiences if I had a chance.
So I'm looking, really, for a mentor, because I just had my birthday.
I'm 50, and I don't have time to go back to school right now --
I'm too busy. So I need somebody
who can put me on a quick catch-up course on how to do something like that,
and lead me through the maze of how one does something like this.
That would be fantastic. So those are my three wishes.
We like to dance together, we like singing together.
And so, if you'll put up with this, I would like to enlist your help
with a first experiment today. The experiment is --
and I notice, by the way, that when you applauded,
that you did it in a typical North American way,
that is, you were raucous and incoherent.
You were not organized. It didn't even occur to you to clap in unison.
Do you think you could do it? I would like to see if this audience would --
no, you haven't practiced, as far as I know --
can you get it together to clap in sync?
It didn't occur to me you'd increase your frequency.
It's interesting.
This is a room full of intelligent people, highly sensitive.
Some trained musicians out there.
Is that what enabled you to synchronize?
So to put the question a little more seriously,
let's ask ourselves what are the minimum requirements for what you just did,
for spontaneous synchronization.
Do you need, for instance, to be as smart as you are?
Do you even need a brain at all just to synchronize?
Do you need to be alive? I mean, that's a spooky thought, right?
Inanimate objects that might spontaneously synchronize themselves.
It's real. In fact, I'll try to explain today that sync is maybe one of,
if not one of the most, perhaps the most pervasive drive in all of nature.
It extends from the subatomic scale to the farthest reaches of the cosmos.
It's a deep tendency toward order in nature
that opposes what we've all been taught about entropy.
I mean, I'm not saying the law of entropy is wrong -- it's not.
But there is a countervailing force in the universe --
the tendency towards spontaneous order. And so that's our theme.
when you hear that we're talking about synchrony in nature,
which is the glorious example of birds that flock together,
or fish swimming in organized schools.
So these are not particularly intelligent creatures,
and yet, as we'll see, they exhibit beautiful ballets.
This is from a BBC show called "Predators,"
and what we're looking at here are examples of synchrony that have to do with defense.
When you're small and vulnerable, like these starlings,
or like the fish, it helps to swarm to avoid predators, to confuse predators.
Let me be quiet for a second because this is so gorgeous.
For a long time, biologists were puzzled by this behavior,
wondering how it could be possible.
We're so used to choreography giving rise to synchrony.
These creatures are not choreographed.
They're choreographing themselves.
I'll show you a computer model made by Iain Couzin, a researcher at Oxford,
that shows how swarms work.
There are just three simple rules.
First, all the individuals are only aware of their nearest neighbors.
Second, all the individuals have a tendency to line up.
And third, they're all attracted to each other,
but they try to keep a small distance apart.
And when you build those three rules in,
automatically you start to see swarms
that look very much like fish schools or bird flocks.
Now, fish like to stay close together, about a body length apart.
Birds try to stay about three or four body lengths apart.
But except for that difference, the rules are the same for both.
There's a fourth rule: when a predator's coming, get out of the way.
Here on the model you see the predator attacking.
The prey move out in random directions,
and then the rule of attraction brings them back together again,
so there's this constant splitting and reforming.
And you see that in nature.
Keep in mind that, although it looks as if each individual is acting to cooperate,
what's really going on is a kind of selfish Darwinian behavior.
Each is scattering away at random to try to save its scales or feathers.
That is, out of the desire to save itself,
each creature is following these rules,
and that leads to something that's safe for all of them.
Even though it looks like they're thinking as a group, they're not.
You might wonder what exactly is the advantage to being in a swarm,
so you can think of several.
are reduced as compared to a small group.
There are many eyes to spot danger.
And you'll see in the example with the starlings, with the birds,
when this peregrine hawk is about to attack them,
that actually waves of panic can propagate,
sending messages over great distances.
You'll see -- let's see, it's coming up possibly at the very end -- maybe not.
Information can be sent over half a kilometer away
in a very short time through this mechanism.
Yes, it's happening here.
See if you can see those waves propagating through the swarm.
It's beautiful. The birds are, we sort of understand, we think,
from that computer model, what's going on.
As I say, it's just those three simple rules,
plus the one about watch out for predators.
We don't, however, really understand at a mathematical level.
I'm a mathematician. We would like to be able to understand better.
I mean, I showed you a computer model, but a computer is not understanding.
A computer is, in a way, just another experiment.
We would really like to have a deeper insight into how this works
and to understand, you know, exactly where this organization comes from.
How do the rules give rise to the patterns?
and it's the case of fireflies.
If you see fireflies in North America,
like so many North American sorts of things,
they tend to be independent operators. They ignore each other.
They each do their own thing, flashing on and off,
paying no attention to their neighbors.
But in Southeast Asia -- places like Thailand or Malaysia or Borneo --
there's a beautiful cooperative behavior that occurs among male fireflies.
You can see it every night along the river banks.
The trees, mangrove trees, are filled with fireflies communicating with light.
Specifically, it's male fireflies who are all flashing in perfect time together,
in perfect synchrony, to reinforce a message to the females.
And the message, as you can imagine, is "Come hither. Mate with me."
so that you can get a sense. This is a single frame.
Then on, and then off -- a 30th of a second, there.
And then watch this whole river bank, and watch how precise the synchrony is.
On, more on and then off.
The combined light from these beetles -- these are actually tiny beetles --
is so bright that fishermen out at sea can use them
as navigating beacons to find their way back to their home rivers. It's stunning.
For a long time it was not believed
when the first Western travelers, like Sir Francis Drake,
went to Thailand and came back with tales of this unbelievable spectacle.
No one believed them.
We don't see anything like this in Europe or in the West.
And for a long time, even after it was documented,
it was thought to be some kind of optical illusion.
Scientific papers were published saying it was twitching eyelids
that explained it, or, you know, a human being's tendency
to see patterns where there are none.
But I hope you've convinced yourself now, with this nighttime video,
that they really were very well synchronized.
to see this kind of spontaneous order,
and I've already hinted that the answer is no.
Well, you don't have to be a whole creature.
You can even be just a single cell.
Like, take, for instance, your pacemaker cells in your heart right now.
They're keeping you alive.
Every beat of your heart depends on this crucial region, the sinoatrial node,
which has about 10,000 independent cells that would each beep,
have an electrical rhythm -- a voltage up and down --
to send a signal to the ventricles to pump.
Now, your pacemaker is not a single cell.
It's this democracy of 10,000 cells that all have to fire in unison
for the pacemaker to work correctly.
If you have epilepsy, there is an instance of billions of brain cells, or at least millions,
discharging in pathological concert.
So this tendency towards order is not always a good thing.
You don't have to be alive. You don't have to be even a single cell.
If you look, for instance, at how lasers work,
that would be a case of atomic synchrony.
In a laser, what makes laser light so different from the light above my head here
is that this light is incoherent --
many different colors and different frequencies,
sort of like the way you clapped initially --
but if you were a laser, it would be rhythmic applause.
It would be all atoms pulsating in unison,
emitting light of one color, one frequency.
which is to demonstrate that inanimate things can synchronize.
Hold your breath for me.
What I have here are two empty water bottles.
This is not Keith Barry doing a magic trick.
This is a klutz just playing with some water bottles.
I have some metronomes here.
Can you hear that?
All right, so, I've got a metronome,
and it's the world's smallest metronome, the -- well, I shouldn't advertise.
Anyway, so this is the world's smallest metronome.
I've set it on the fastest setting, and I'm going to now take
another one set to the same setting.
We can try this first. If I just put them on the table together,
there's no reason for them to synchronize, and they probably won't.
What I'm hoping is that they might just drift apart
because their frequencies aren't perfectly the same.
Right? They did.
They were in sync for a while, but then they drifted apart.
And the reason is that they're not able to communicate.
Now, you might think that's a bizarre idea.
How can metronomes communicate?
Well, they can communicate through mechanical forces.
So I'm going to give them a chance to do that.
I also want to wind this one up a bit. How can they communicate?
I'm going to put them on a movable platform,
which is the "Guide to Graduate Study at Cornell." Okay? So here it is.
Let's see if we can get this to work.
My wife pointed out to me that it will work better if I put both on at the same time
because otherwise the whole thing will tip over.
All right. So there we go. Let's see. OK, I'm not trying to cheat --
let me start them out of sync. No, hard to even do that.
Now, that might seem a bit whimsical,
but this pervasiveness of this tendency towards spontaneous order
sometimes has unexpected consequences.
And a clear case of that,
was something that happened in London in the year 2000.
The Millennium Bridge was supposed to be the pride of London --
a beautiful new footbridge erected across the Thames,
first river crossing in over 100 years in London.
There was a big competition for the design of this bridge,
and the winning proposal was submitted by an unusual team --
in the TED spirit, actually -- of an architect --
perhaps the greatest architect in the United Kingdom, Lord Norman Foster --
working with an artist, a sculptor, Sir Anthony Caro,
and an engineering firm, Ove Arup.
And together they submitted a design based on Lord Foster's vision,
which was -- he remembered as a kid reading Flash Gordon comic books,
and he said that when Flash Gordon would come to an abyss,
he would shoot what today would be a kind of a light saber.
and then scamper across on this blade of light.
He said, "That's the vision I want to give to London.
I want a blade of light across the Thames."
So they built the blade of light,
and it's a very thin ribbon of steel, the world's --
probably the flattest and thinnest suspension bridge there is,
with cables that are out on the side.
You're used to suspension bridges with big droopy cables on the top.
These cables were on the side of the bridge,
like if you took a rubber band and stretched it taut across the Thames --
that's what's holding up this bridge.
Now, everyone was very excited to try it out.
On opening day, thousands of Londoners came out, and something happened.
And within two days the bridge was closed to the public.
So I want to first show you some interviews with people
who were on the bridge on opening day, who will describe what happened.
rather like being on the boat.
and I remember it had lots of flags up and down the sides, so you could definitely --
there was something going on sideways, it felt, maybe.
because if you didn't keep your balance,
then you would just fall over about, like, to the left or right, about 45 degrees.
Interviewer: So just show me how you walk normally. Right.
And then show me what it was like when the bridge started to go. Right.
So you had to deliberately push your feet out sideways and --
oh, and short steps?
that it was probably the number of people on it.
Think of the bridge as being like this platform.
Think of the people as being like metronomes.
Now, you might not be used to thinking of yourself as a metronome,
but after all, we do walk like -- I mean, we oscillate back and forth as we walk.
And especially if we start to walk like those people did, right?
They all showed this strange sort of skating gait
that they adopted once the bridge started to move.
And so let me show you now the footage of the bridge.
But also, after you see the bridge on opening day, you'll see an interesting clip
of work done by a bridge engineer at Cambridge named Allan McRobie,
who figured out what happened on the bridge,
and who built a bridge simulator to explain exactly what the problem was.
It was a kind of unintended positive feedback loop
between the way the people walked and the way the bridge began to move,
that engineers knew nothing about.
Actually, I think the first person you'll see
is the young engineer who was put in charge of this project. Okay.
we'd checked it to codes -- to heavier loads than the codes --
and here it was doing something that we didn't know about.
Interviewer: You didn't expect. Engineer: Exactly.
shows whole sections of the crowd -- hundreds of people --
apparently rocking from side to side in unison,
not only with each other, but with the bridge.
This synchronized movement seemed to be driving the bridge.
But how could the crowd become synchronized?
Was there something special about the Millennium Bridge that caused this effect?
This was to be the focus of the investigation.
Now, Allan, this is all your fault, isn't it? Allan McRobie: Yes.
and this, you reckon, mimics the action of the real bridge?
suggesting that a bridge simulator ought to wobble
in the same way as the real bridge --
provided we hung it on pendulums of exactly the right length.
Just by walking. Interviewer: Well, it's certainly going now.
You have to be careful where you put your feet down, don't you,
because if you get it wrong, it just throws you off your feet.
it's moving your feet away from under you. AM: Yes.
So already, the simulator is making me walk in exactly the same way
as our witnesses walked on the real bridge.
I wanted my own opening-day crowd, the sound check team.
Their instructions: just walk normally.
It's really intriguing because none of these people is trying to drive it.
They're all having some difficulty walking.
And the only way you can walk comfortably is by getting in step.
But then, of course, everyone is driving the bridge.
You can't help it. You're actually forced by the movement of the bridge to get into step,
and therefore to drive it to move further.
maybe I'd better end. I see I've gone over.
But I hope that you'll go outside and see the world in a new way,
to see all the amazing synchrony around us. Thank you.
Of the five senses, vision is the one that I appreciate the most,
and it's the one that I can least take for granted.
He wanted us instead to use these cheap cardboard viewers,
so that there was no chance at all that our eyes would be damaged.
where the first shots were fired against the British in 1775,
which was part of the Route 128 high-tech axis in those days --
so, the equivalent of Silicon Valley in the '70s.
As a kid, I watched a lot of television
I played a lot of chess.
and I decided that was what I wanted to do for a living.
even though he had no direct evidence that I was any good whatsoever;
everything he saw was just a blur.
Now, this gives a real meaning to the term "blind faith,"
Now, faith in things which cannot be seen, which cannot be proved,
is not the sort of faith that I've ever really related to all that much.
I tend to like science,
a middle ground tread by people like poor old Charles Babbage
Vannevar Bush with his memex --
this idea of all of human knowledge at your fingertips --
he had this vision.
Or Paul Baran, and his vision for packet switching.
Hardly anybody listened to him in his day.
Or even the people who actually pulled it off,
the people at Bolt, Beranek and Newman in Boston,
and sketching things on the back of napkins and on note papers
and arguing over dinner at Howard Johnson's --
on Route 128 in Lexington, Massachusetts,
Vision based on what one cannot see,
the vision of that unseen and unknowable.
The vision of that which has already been proven or can be ascertained.
and work like hell.
I think these are the four principles that go into this.
And it's that third one, especially,
towards trying to understand how it works.
Then there's another, more classical attitude
which embraces beauty and craft;
another one which believes in the pure transparency of content;
and honesty and rawness.
on left and the right;
tradition and revolution on the top and the bottom.
And if you go on the diagonal, you get content and form,
and then beauty and truth.
which has nothing whatsoever to do with vision at all,
or, for that matter, nothing to do with our conference theme
of "Inspired by Nature,"
except to the extent of the fable of the frog
who gives a ride to the scorpion on his back to get across the river
and who I was --
I saw it as just this road to discovery.
So, the different elements of comics, like pictures and words,
where something which resembles the physical world can be abstracted
in a couple of different directions:
of the entire boundary of visual iconography,
which comics can embrace.
And if you move to the right you also get language,
because that's abstracting even further from resemblance,
but still maintaining meaning.
to capture its essential character through visuals.
Comics is a kind of call and response,
Comics presents a kind of temporal map.
and I found some in history.
in these ancient versions of the same idea.
or a 200-foot-long embroidery,
or painted deerskin and tree bark
running across 88 accordion-folded pages.
and this is from 1450, by the way --
I had to do a little bit of typesetting,
And so, I kept my eyes peeled
to see if the sort of changes that happened
when we went from pre-print comics to print comics
would happen when we went beyond, to post-print comics.
was that we could mix the visuals of comics
as the content of the new technology.
it's all the same.
has a spatial relationship to every other element at all times.
Each of them has a single unbroken reading line,
that is, that the basic idea that as you move through space
Adjacent spaces were no longer adjacent moments,
so the basic idea of comics was being broken again and again
to somehow bring that back?
It's a different shape, but other than that,
it's the same basic limitation.
But that's only if you look at the monitor as a page,
X, Y and also Z.
What I'm searching for is a durable mutation --
that's what all of us are searching for.
Now, we're taking this basic idea of presenting comics in a visual medium,
But even though we're only experiencing it one piece at a time,
as you get full immersive displays and whatnot,
See what's going on here
We'll go by this a little quickly. You get the idea.
I just want to get to the last panel.
It's by a guy named Daniel Merlin Goodbrey, in Britain.
I think this is important because media --
is going to provide us with our most efficient escape
so that the identity of the media becomes increasingly unique --
and see its shape.
The north coast of California has rainforests --
temperate rainforests -- where it can rain more than 100 inches a year.
This is the realm of the Coast Redwood tree.
Its species name is Sequoia sempervirens.
Sequoia sempervirens is the tallest living organism on Earth.
The range of the species goes up to as much as 380 feet tall.
That's 38 stories tall.
These are trees that would stand out in midtown Manhattan.
Nobody knows how old the oldest living Coast Redwoods are
because nobody has ever drilled into any of them
to count their annual growth rings, and, in any case,
the centers of the oldest individuals appear to be hollow.
But it's believed that the oldest living Redwoods
are perhaps 2,500 years old -- roughly the age of the Parthenon --
although it's also suspected that there may be individual trees
that are older than that.
The largest individuals of this species,
the dreadnoughts of their kind, live just on the north coast of California,
where the rain is really intense.
In recent historic times, about 96 percent of the Coast Redwood forest
was cut down, especially in a series of bursts of intense liquidation logging,
clear-cutting that took place in the 1970s through the early 1990s.
Even so, about four percent of the primeval Redwood rainforest remains intact,
wild and now protected -- entirely protected --
in a chain of small parks strung out like pearls
along the north coast of California, including Redwood National Park.
But curiously, Redwood rainforests, the fragments that we have left,
to this day remain under-explored.
Redwood rainforest is incredibly difficult to move through,
and even today, individual trees are being discovered
that have never been seen before, including, in the summer of 2006,
Hyperion, the world's tallest tree.
I'm going to ask you to imagine what a Redwood really is as a living organism.
And, Chris, if I could have you up here? I have a tape measure.
It's a kind loaner from TED.
And Chris, if you could take the end of that tape measure?
We're going to show you what the diameter
at breast height of a big Redwood is.
Unfortunately, this tape isn't long enough -- it's only a 25-foot tape.
Chris, could you extend your arm out that way? There we go. OK.
And maybe about here, about 30 feet, is the diameter of a big Redwood.
Now, let your imagination go upward into space.
Think about this tree, rising upward into Redwood space, 325 feet,
32 stories, an individual living organism articulating its forms
upward into space over long periods of time.
not human time, but what we might call Redwood time.
Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time.
To us, when we look at a Redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still,
and yet Redwoods are constantly in motion,
moving upward into space, articulating themselves
and filling Redwood space over Redwood time, over thousands of years.
Plant this small seed, wait 2,000 years, and you get this:
the Lost Monarch.
It dwells in the Grove of Titans on the north coast,
and was discovered in 1998.
And yet, when you look at the base of a Redwood tree,
you're not seeing the organism.
You're like a mouse looking at the foot of an elephant,
and most of the organism is overhead, unseen.
Steve Sillett and Marie Antoine are the principal explorers
of the Redwood forest canopy. They're world-class athletes,
and they also are world-class forest ecology scientists.
Steve Sillett, when he was a 19-year-old college student
at Reed College, had heard that the Redwood forest canopy
is considered to be a so-called Redwood desert.
That is to say, at that time it was believed
that there was nothing up there except the branches of Redwood trees.
And with a friend of his, he took it upon himself to free-climb a Redwood
without ropes or any equipment to see what was up there.
He climbed up a small tree next to this giant Redwood,
and then he leaped through space and grabbed a branch with his hands,
and ended up hanging, like catching a bar of a trapeze.
And then, from there, he climbed directly up the bark
until he got to the top of the tree.
Neither one of them had noticed that there was
a Yellow Jacket wasp's nest the size of a bowling ball
hanging from the branch that Steve had jumped into.
And when Marwood made the jump, he was covered with wasps
stinging him in the face and eyes. He nearly let go.
He would have fallen to his death, being 75 feet above the ground.
But they made it to the top, and what they found
was not a Redwood desert, but a lost world --
a kind of three-dimensional labyrinth in the air, filled with unknown life.
Now, I had been working on other topics:
the emergence of infectious diseases,
which come out of the natural ecosystems of the Earth,
make a trans-species jump, and get into humans.
My wife and I adore our children.
And I began climbing trees with my kids as just something to do with them,
using the so-called arborist climbing technique,
with ropes. You use ropes to get yourself up into the crown of a tree.
Children are incredibly adept at climbing trees.
That's my son, Oliver.
They don't seem to suffer from the same fear of heights that humans do.
are somewhat closer to our roots as primates in the arboreal forest.
Humans appear to be the only primates that I know of
that are afraid of heights.
All other primates, when they're scared,
they run up a tree, where they feel safe.
We camped overnight in the trees, in tree boats.
This is my daughter Laura, then 15, looking out of a tree boat.
She's, by the way, tied in with a rope so she can't fall.
Looking out of a tree boat in the morning and hearing birdsong
coming in three dimensions around us.
We had been visited in the night by flying squirrels,
who don't seem to recognize humans for what they are
because they've never seen them in the canopy before.
And we practiced advanced techniques like sky-walking,
where you can move from tree to tree through space,
rather like Spiderman.
It became a writing project.
which trails a fishing line, which gets over a branch in the tree,
and then you ascend up a rope which has been dragged into the tree by the line.
You ascend 30 stories.
There are two people climbing this tree, Gaya,
which is thought to be one of the oldest Redwoods. There they are.
They are only one-seventh of the way up that tree.
You do feel a sense of exposure.
There is a small person right down there on the ground.
You feel like you're climbing a wall of wood.
But then you enter the Redwood canopy,
and it's like coming through a layer of clouds.
And all of a sudden, you lose sight of the ground,
and you also lose sight of the sky,
and you're in a three-dimensional labyrinth in the air
filled with hanging gardens of ferns growing out of soil,
which is populated with all kinds of small organisms.
These are huckleberry bushes.
Many species of mosses, and then all sorts of lichens just plastering the tree.
When you get near the top of the tree, you feel like you can't fall --
in fact, it's difficult to move.
You're worming your way through branches which are crowded
with living things that don't occur near the ground.
It's like scuba diving into a coral reef,
except you're going upward instead of downward.
And then the trees tend to flare out into platform-like areas at the top.
Maria's sitting on one of them.
These limbs could be five to six hundred years old.
Redwoods grow very slowly in their tops.
They also have a feature: thickets of huckleberry bushes
that grow out of the tops of Redwood trees
that are technically known as huckleberry afros,
and you can sit there and snack on the berries while you're resting.
because they have a propensity to do something called reiteration.
A Redwood is a fractal. And as they put out limbs,
the limbs burst into small trees, copies of the Redwood.
Now, here we see a reiteration in Chronos, one of the older Redwoods.
This reiteration is a huge flying buttress
that comes out the tree itself.
This buttress is less than halfway up the tree.
And then it bursts into a forest of Redwoods.
This particular extra trunk is a meter across at the base
and extends upward for 150 feet.
It's as big as any of the biggest trees east of the Mississippi River,
and yet it's only a minor feature on Chronos.
made by Steve Sillett, Marie Antoine and their colleagues, gives you an idea.
What you're seeing here is a hierarchical schematic development
of the trunks of this tree as it has elaborated itself over time into six layers of fractal,
of trunks springing from trunks springing from trunks.
I asked Steve to put a human being in this to give a sense of scale.
There's the person, right there. The person is waving to us.
I've wanted to ask Craig Venter if it would be possible to insert
a synthetic chromosome into a human
so that we could reiterate ourselves if we wanted to.
And if we were able to reiterate, then the fingers of our hand
would be people who looked like us,
and they would have people on their hands and so on.
And if we had Redwood-like biology,
we would have six layers of people on our hands, as it were.
And it would be a lovely thing to be able to wave to someone
and have all our reiterations wave at the same time.
We're looking at that yellow box.
And this hallucinatory drawing shows you --
everything you see in this drawing is Iluvatar.
These are millennial structures -- portions of the tree
that are believed to be more than 1,000 years old.
There are four humans in this shot -- one, two, three, four.
And there's also something that I want to show you.
This is a flying buttress.
Redwoods grow back into themselves as they expand into space,
and this flying buttress is a limb shot out of that small trunk,
going back into the main trunk and fusing with it.
Flying buttresses, just as in a cathedral, help strengthen the crown of the tree
and help the tree exist longer through time.
The scientists are doing all kinds of experiments in these trees.
They've wired them like patients in an ICU.
and down into their trunks,
possibly all the way into their root systems.
They also have the ability to put roots anywhere in the tree itself.
If a portion of a Redwood is rotting,
the Redwood will send roots into its own form
and draw nutrients out of itself as it falls apart.
If we had Redwood-like biology, if we got a touch of gangrene in our arm
then we could just, you know,
extract the nutrients extract the nutrients and the moisture out of it until it fell off.
Canopy soil can occur up to a meter deep,
hundreds of feet above the ground, and there are organisms in this soil
that have, as yet, no names.
These copepods are a major constituent of the oceans,
and they are a major part of the diet of grazing baleen whales.
What they're doing in the Redwood forest canopy soil
hundreds of feet above the ocean, or how they got there,
is completely unknown.
There are some interesting theories
that, if I had time, I would tell you about.
But as you go and you look closer at a tree,
what you see is, you see increasing complexity.
We're looking at the very top of Gaya, which is thought to be the oldest Redwood.
Gaya may be 3,000 to 5,000 years old,
no one really knows, but its top has broken off
and it's been rotting back now.
to form in its complexity that we see right now.
As you look at a tree, it takes a magnifying glass to see a giant tree.
I have to show you something unfortunately very sad
at the conclusion of this talk.
The Eastern Hemlock tree has often been described as the Redwood of the East.
And we're moving in a full circle now.
In the 1950s, a small organism appeared in Richmond, Virginia,
called the Hemlock woolly adelgid.
It made a trans-species jump out of some other organism in Asia,
where it was living on Hemlock trees in Asia.
When it moved into its new host, the Eastern Hemlock tree,
it escaped its predators, and the new tree had no resistance to it.
The Eastern Hemlock forest is being considered in some ways
the last fragments of primeval rainforest east of the Mississippi River.
but in Great Smoky Mountains National Park
it can rain up to 100 inches of rain a year.
And in the last two to three summers, these invasive organisms,
this kind of Ebola of the trees, as it were,
has swept through the primeval Hemlock forest of the east,
and has absolutely wiped it out. I climbed there this past summer.
This is Great Smoky Mountains National Park,
and the Hemlocks are dead as far as the eye can see.
And what we're seeing is not just the potential death
of the Eastern Hemlock species --
that is to say, its extinction from nature due to this invading parasite --
but we're also seeing the death of an incredibly complex ecosystem
for which these trees are merely the substrate
for the aerial labyrinth of the sky that exists in their crowns.
One of the things that is just -- I almost can't conceive it --
is the idea that the national news media hasn't picked this up at all,
and this is the devastation of one of the most important ecosystems in North America.
What can the Redwoods tell us about ourselves?
Well, I think they can tell us something about human time.
The flickering, transitory quality of human time
and the brevity of human life -- the necessity to love.
But we're different from trees, and they can also teach us
something about ourselves in the differences that we have.
We are human, and we have the capacity to love,
we have the capacity to wonder, and we have a sort of
boundless curiosity, a restless inquisitiveness
that so suits us as primates, I think.
an entirely new way of loving my children.
Exploring with them the forest canopy
has been one of the most lovely things of my existence on Earth.
And I think that one of the happiest things is the sense that
with my children I've been able to introduce them
into the very small circle of humans who are lucky enough,
or possibly stupid enough, to still climb trees.
Thank you very much.
I think it was Nathan Myhrvold who told me that it was thought that
because these trees are like, 2,000 years and older,
on many of them there are ecosystems where there are species
that are not found anywhere on the Earth
except on that one tree. Is that correct?
And I was a member of a climbing team that made the first climb of it, in 2006.
And while we were climbing Hyperion, Marie Antoine spotted
an unknown species of golden-brown ant about halfway up the trunk.
Ants are not known to occur in Redwood trees, curiously enough,
and we wondered whether this ant, this species of ant,
was only endemic to that one tree, or possibly to that grove.
And in subsequent climbs they could never find that ant again,
and so no specimens have ever been collected.
We don't know what it is -- we just know it's there.
if some other species than us was recording the stories that mattered on Earth,
you know, our stories are about Iraq and war and politics and celebrity gossip.
You've just told us a different story of this tragic arms race that's happening,
and maybe whole ecosystems gone forever.
It's an amazing sense of wonder you've given me,
and a sense of just how fragile this whole thing is.
parasites that move into the human species.
But that's just a very small facet
of a much greater problem of invasions of species worldwide,
all through the ecosystems, and you know, the Earth itself --
You can think of the Earth's biosphere as a palace,
and the continents are rooms in the palace,
and the islands are small rooms.
But lately, the doors of the palace have been flung open,
and the walls are coming down.
You know, we're going to do things a little differently.
I'm not going to show you a presentation. I'm going to talk to you.
And at the same time, we're going to look at just images
You can -- I can compete for your attention with the strange pictures
that you see on screen that come from there.
I thought I'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this,
and then get John back out here so we can talk interactively
a little bit more and think and ask questions.
You know, I guess the first question is,
why build a virtual world at all?
And I think the answer to that is always going to be
at least driven to a certain extent by the people
initially crazy enough to start the project, you know.
and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager
and then an adult, to actually try and build this kind of thing.
I was a very creative kid who read a lot, and got into electronics first,
and then later, programming computers, when I was really young.
I was just always trying to make things.
I was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things,
but I wanted my door, I thought it would be cool if my door went up
rather than opened, like on Star Trek.
I thought it would be neat to do that. And so I got up in the ceiling
and I cut through the ceiling joists, much to my parents' delight,
and put the door, you know, being pulled up through the ceiling.
that you imagine from a design perspective.
And so for me, I know that when the Internet came around
and I was doing computer programming and just, you know,
just generally trying to run my own little company
and figure out what to do with the Internet and with computers,
the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things,
of what has happened with Second Life, and I think it's important.
I also think that more generally, the use of the Internet and technology
represent the best we can do to achieve that right now.
You know, another way to look at that,
and related to the content and, you know, thinking about space,
is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space.
I thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second.
you know, it's this dream that we all share.
And so inevitably, you would transform yourself --
irreversibly, in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration.
And then the second thing is that there's this tangible sense
that if you travel far enough, you can find out there --
oh, yeah -- you have no idea what you're going to find
once you get there, into space.
It's going to be different than here.
And in fact, it's going to be so different than what we see here on earth
that anything is going to be possible.
So that's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of
And I think that if you really sit and think about it,
virtual worlds, and where we're going
with more and more computing technology,
represent essentially the likely, really tactically possible
version of space exploration.
We are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because, like space,
comparing space to Second Life, most people don't realize, kind of --
and then this is just like the Internet in the early '90s.
In fact, Second Life virtual worlds are a lot like the Internet in the early '90s today:
everybody's very excited,
there's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next
from moment to moment, and then there's despair
and everybody thinks the whole thing's not going to work.
Everything that's happening with Second Life
and more broadly with virtual worlds, all happened in the early '90s.
We always play a game at the office where you can take any article
and find the same article where you just replace the words "Second Life"
with "Web," and "virtual reality" with "Internet."
You can find exactly the same articles
written about everything that people are observing.
To give you an idea of scale, Second Life is about 20,000 CPUs at this point.
It's about 20,000 computers connected together
in three facilities in the United States right now,
that are simulating this virtual space. And the virtual space itself --
there's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there,
about five percent a month or so right now, in terms of new servers being added.
And so of course, radically unlike the real world,
and like the Internet, the whole thing is expanding
very, very quickly, and historically exponentially.
So that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here
by the amount of content that's in there,
and I think that amount is critical.
It was critical with the virtual world
that it be this space of truly infinite possibility.
We're very sensitive to that as humans.
You know, you know when you see it. You know when you can do anything in a space
and you know when you can't.
Second Life today is this 20,000 machines,
and it's about 100 million or so user-created objects where, you know,
an object would be something like this, possibly interactive.
Tens of millions of them are thinking all the time;
they have code attached to them.
So it's a really large world already, in terms of the amount of stuff that's there
World of Warcraft comes on, like, four DVDs.
and the sort of chat rooms and content on AOL at the time,
what's happening here is something very different,
because the sheer scale of what people can do
when they're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing.
is going to be bigger in total usage than the Web itself.
And let me justify that with two statements.
Generically, what we use the Web for is to organize, exchange,
create and consume information.
It's kind of like Irene talking about Google being data-driven.
I'd say I kind of think about the world as being information.
Everything that we interact with, all the experiences that we have,
is kind of us flowing through a sea of information
but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world
that I think are the important ways that they're very different
and much better than what we've been able to do to date with the Web.
well, the first difference for virtual worlds is that
information is presented to you in the virtual world
using the most powerful iconic symbols
that you can possibly use with human beings.
So for example, C-H-A-I-R is the English word for that,
but a picture of this is a universal symbol.
Everybody knows what it means. There's no need to translate it.
You can do tests that show that you'll remember
that I was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better.
So when you organize information using the symbols of our memory,
using the most common symbols that we've been immersed in all our lives,
you maximally both excite, stimulate,
is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social.
You are always there with other people.
And we as humans are social creatures and must, or are aided by,
or enjoy more, the consumption of information in the presence of others.
It's essential to us. You can't escape it.
but you can't talk to them.
You can't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras
on the same page as you, and ask them,
"Hey, have you seen one of these before? Because I'm thinking about buying it."
is an example of how as social creatures
we want to experience information in that way.
So that second point, that we inherently experience information together
or want to experience it together,
is critical to essentially, kind of,
I think that wherever this is all going,
whether it's Second Life or its descendants, or something broader
that happens all around the world at a lot of different points --
this is what we're going to see the Internet used for,
and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert,
so that the Web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information
is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern,
but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment.
Big idea, but I think highly defensible.
So let me stop there and bring John back,
and maybe we can just have a longer conversation.
Thank you. John. That's great.
Like for example, in the 19th century,
any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds
were explicitly utopian.
Is a virtual world likely to be a utopia, would be one way I'd say it.
The answer is no, and I think the reason why is because
the Web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up.
at the level of the individual actor, at the level of the Lego blocks,
if you will, that make up the virtual world.
You have to have that level of freedom, and so I'm often asked that,
you know, is there a, kind of, utopian or,
is there a utopian tendency to Second Life and things like it,
that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it?
Those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody,
even if you mean well when you build them.
And what's more, human society, when it's controlled,
when you set out a grand scheme of rules,
a new way of people interacting, or a new way of laying out a city, or whatever,
that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond,
you know -- I always laughingly say -- the Mall of America, you know,
which is like, the largest piece of centrally designed architecture
that, you know, has been built.
in Second Life that you were pretty sure people would want to use
in the creation of their avatars or in communicating
that people actually in practice said, no, I'm not interested in that at all,
and name something that you didn't come up with
that almost immediately people began to demand.
One of my favorites. I had this feature that I built into Second Life --
I was really passionate about it.
It was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody
and have a more private conversation,
but it wasn't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody.
I thought it was such a good idea from my perspective,
and it was just absolutely never used, and we ultimately --
I think we've now turned it off, if I remember.
We finally gave up, took it out of the code.
But more generally, you know, one other example I think about this,
it was only about as big as this college campus.
And we had -- we zoned it, you know: we put a nightclub,
we put a disco where you could dance,
and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to,
and we had another place that was like a boardwalk, kind of a Coney Island.
And we laid out the zoning, but of course,
people could build all around it however they wanted to.
-- which is really a small amount of time, even in Second Life time --
I remember the users, the people who were then using Second Life,
the residents came to me and said, we want to buy the disco --
And I remember that that was just so telling, you know,
that you didn't know exactly what was going to happen.
When you think about stuff that people have built that's popular --
You know, an example of something -- pregnancy.
You can have a baby in Second Life.
This is done entirely using, kind of, the tools that are built into Second Life,
so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby, of course --
Second Life is, at the platform level, at the level of the company -- at Linden Lab --
Second Life has no game properties to it whatsoever.
There is no attempt to structure the experience,
to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it.
So of course, we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or, you know,
taking two avatars and merging them, or something.
as a purchasable experience that you can have in Second Life and so --
And of course, the existence of an economy is another idea.
I didn't talk about it, but it's a critical feature.
When people are given the opportunity to create in the world,
there's really two things they want.
One is fair ownership of the things they create.
True on the Web -- also true in Second Life.
And so the existence of an economy is critical.
an avatar, in Second Life.
Respond, and then we'll get the rest of your question.
PR: No, no. I didn't. One of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar --
a female avatar -- that I used to be once in a while.
But my avatar is a guy wearing chaps.
Spiky hair -- spikier than this. Kind of orange hair.
Handlebar mustache. Kind of a Village People sort of a character.
aren't translated into the Second Life map.
that you see in emerging societies.
So a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of Second Life today is that
it's more like the Wild West than it is like Rome, from a cultural standpoint.
and in an environment where, if you walk into a bar in Second Life,
65 percent of the people there are not in the United States,
and in fact are speaking their, you know, various and different languages.
and allow you to use Google or Babel Fish
or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly
translate spoken -- I'm sorry -- typed text between individuals.
And so, the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot
that's happening inside Second Life is quite --
I think, quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms
in the real world we've ever been able to achieve.
So, I think that culture will fine-tune, it will emerge,
but we still have some years to wait while that happens,
So, the average age of a person in Second Life is 32,
however, the use of Second Life increases dramatically
usage goes up in terms of, like, hours per week by 40 percent
as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life, so there's not --
many people make the mistake of believing that Second Life
is some kind of an online game. Actually it's generally unappealing --
I'm just speaking broadly and critically --
I mean, these are very nice pictures,
but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent
to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a Grand Theft Auto 4.
So average age: 32. I mentioned
65 percent of the users are not in the United States.
The distribution amongst countries is extremely broad.
The dominant ones are -- if you take the UK and Europe,
together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in Second Life.
In terms of psychographic --
oh, men and women: men and women are almost equally matched in Second Life,
Women use Second Life, though,
about 30 to 40 percent more, on an hours basis, than men do,
meaning that more men sign up than women,
In terms of psychographic, you know, the people in Second Life
challenge you to just do this and find out.
But it's not a bunch of programmers.
It's not easy to describe as a demographic.
If I had to just sort of paint a broad picture, I'd say, remember the people
who were really getting into eBay in the first few years of eBay?
from what they're doing in Second Life, so it's a very build --
when you were young and, you know, liked to make things.
I mean, it's not often that you hear somebody
describe themselves as really creative.
I suspect that's possibly a euphemism for C student
who spent a lot of time in his room? Is it possible?
When I got to college -- I studied physics in college --
and I got really -- it was funny,
because I was definitely a more antisocial kid. I read all the time.
I was shy. I don't seem like it now, but I was very shy.
Moved around a bunch -- had that experience too.
So I did, kind of, I think, live in my own world,
and obviously that helps, you know, engage your real interest in something.
I wasn't, like, an obsessed -- you know, get A's kind of guy.
I was going to say, I had a great social experience
when I went to college that I hadn't had before,
a more fraternal experience, where I met six or seven other guys
who I studied physics with, and I was very competitive with them,
so then I started to get A's. But you're right: I wasn't an A student.
So, you're saying that in the pamphlet there's a statement
that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones --
our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities --
and that in fact, much of human life and human experience
may move into the digital realm.
And then that's kind of a horrifying thought, of course.
That's a frightening change, frightening disruption.
I guess, and you're asking, what do I think about that? How do I --
One is, it's disturbing like the Internet or electricity was.
That is to say, it's a big change, but it isn't avoidable.
because the basic motive that people have --
to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy
into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the Web.
So this change, I believe, is a huge disruptive change.
but I think that as -- even a sober, you know, the most sober,
disconnected thinker about this, looking at it from the side,
has to conclude, based on the data,
that with those kinds of economic forces at play,
there is definitely going to be a sea change,
and that change is going to be intensely disruptive
relative to our concept of our very lives and being,
and our identities, as well.
I don't think we can get away from those changes.
I think generally, we were talking about this --
I think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it,
being -- surviving there, having a good life there, so to speak,
is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it,
because of the languages, because of the entrepreneurial richness of it,
the sort of flea market nature, if you will, of the virtual world today.
And I think that if that is true of virtual worlds,
and therefore something that we should ride out.
But I would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this,
other than me, have said, you know, fasten your seat belts
because the change is coming. There are going to be big changes.
JH: Philip Rosedale, thank you very much.
In 1962, Buckminster Fuller
presented the particularly audacious proposal for the Geoscope.
It was a 200-foot diameter geodesic sphere
to be suspended over the East River in New York City, in full view of the United Nations.
It was a big idea, for sure, and it was one that he felt could truly inform
and deeply affect the decision making of this body
through animations of global data, trends
and other information regarding the globe, on this sphere.
And today, 45 years later,
we clearly have no less need for this kind of clarity and perspective,
but what we do have is improved technology.
We can use LEDs.
LEDs are smaller, they're cheaper, they're longer lasting, they're more efficient.
Most importantly for this, they're faster.
And this speed, combined with today's high-performance micro-controllers,
allows us to actually simulate, in this piece,
over 17,000 LEDs -- using just 64.
And the way this happens is through the phenomenon of persistence of vision.
But as this ring rotates at about 1,700 rpm -- that's 28 times per second.
The equator's speed is actually about 60 miles per hour.
There are four on-board micro-controllers
that, each time this ring rotates
it, as it passes the rear of the display,
it picks up a position signal.
And from that, the on-board micro-controllers
can extrapolate the position of the ring at all points around the revolution
and display arbitrary bitmap images and animations.
In addition to higher resolution versions of this display,
my father and I are working on a new patent-pending design
for a fully volumetric display using the same phenomenon.
It achieves this by rotating LEDs about two axes.
So as you can see here, this is a, eleven-inch diameter circuit board.
These blocks represent LEDs.
And so you could see that as this disc rotates about this axis,
it will create a disc of light that we can control.
That's nothing new: that's a propeller clock;
that's the rims that you can buy for your car.
But what is new is that, when we rotate this disc about this axis,
this disc of light actually becomes a sphere of light.
And so we can control that with micro-controllers
and create a fully volumetric, three-dimensional display with just 256 LEDs.
due out in May -- but what we've done is we've put together a small demo,
just to show the geometric translation of points into a sphere.
I've got a little video to show you,
but keep in mind that this is with no electronic control,
and this is also with only four LEDs.
This is actually only about 1.5 percent of what the final display will be in May.
So, take a look.
And here you can see it's rotating about the vertical axis only, creating circles.
And then, as the other axis kicks in,
those actually blur into a volume.
And the shutter speed of the camera
actually makes it slightly less effective in this case.
It'll be on display at the Interactive Telecommunications Spring Show
in Greenwich Village in New York City -- that's open to the public,
definitely invite you all to come and attend -- it's a fantastic show.
There are hundreds of student innovators with fantastic projects.
This piece, actually, will be on display
down in the Sierra Simulcast Lounge
in the breaks between now and the end of the show.
So I'd love to talk to you all, and invite you
to come down and take a closer look.
It's an honor to be here. Thanks very much.
The career that I started early on in my life
and at that time I was working in the Antarctic and the Arctic,
and high deserts and low deserts.
Until about a dozen years ago, when I was really captured by caves,
and I really re-focused most of my research in that direction.
I work in some of the most extreme cave environments on the planet.
Many of them are trying to kill us from the minute we go into them,
but nevertheless, they're absolutely gripping,
and contain unbelievable biological wonders
that are very, very different from those that we have on the planet.
Apart from the intrinsic value
of the biology and mineralogy and geo-microbiology that we do there,
we're also using these as templates
for figuring out how to go look
for life on other planets.
Particularly Mars, but also Europa,
the small, icy moon around Jupiter.
And perhaps, someday, far beyond our solar system itself.
on the Moon and Mars particularly,
and elsewhere in the solar system.
I think it's time that we transitioned
to a solar system-going civilization and species.
And, as an outgrowth of all of this then,
I wonder about whether we can, and whether we even should,
think about transporting Earth-type life to other planets.
Notably Mars, as a first example.
is how I actually got to this state
and why I do the work that I do.
Why don't I have a normal job, a sensible job?
And then of course, I blame the Soviet Union.
Because in the mid-1950s,
when I was a tiny child,
they had the audacity to launch
a very primitive little satellite called Sputnik,
which sent the Western world into a hysterical tailspin.
And a tremendous amount of money
went into the funding of science
and mathematics skills for kids.
And I'm a product of that generation,
like so many other of my peers.
It really caught hold of us, and caught fire,
and it would be lovely if we could reproduce that again now.
-- even though I impersonate a grown-up in daily life,
but I do a fairly good job of that --
but really retaining that childlike quality
of not caring what other people think
about what you're interested in, is really critical.
The next element is the fact that
I have applied a value judgment
and my value judgment is that the presence of life
is better than no life.
And so, life is more valuable than no life.
And so I think that that holds together
a great deal of the work
that people in this audience approach.
and that was a product of my being a young undergraduate
when the Viking Landers landed on Mars.
And that took what had been
a tiny little astronomical object in the sky,
that you would see as a dot,
and turned it completely into a landscape,
as that very first primitive picture
came rastering across the screen.
And when it became a landscape,
it also became a destination,
and altered, really, the course of my life.
my colleague and mentor and friend, Steve Schneider,
at the National Center for Atmospheric Research,
working on global change issues.
We've written a number of things on
the role of Gaia hypothesis --
whether or not you could consider Earth as a single entity
in any meaningful scientific sense,
and then, as an outgrowth of that,
I worked on the environmental consequences of nuclear war.
But what it taught me was to look at Earth as a planet
with external eyes, not just as our home.
And that is a wonderful stepping away in perspective,
to try to then think about the way
our planet behaves, as a planet,
and with the life that's on it.
And all of this seems to me to be
a salient point in history.
We're getting ready to begin to go
through the process of leaving our planet of origin
and out into the wider solar system and beyond.
How hard is it going to be to find life on Mars?
Well, sometimes it's really very hard for us to find each other,
even on this planet.
So, finding life on another planet
is a non-trivial occupation
and we spend a lot of time trying to think about that.
Whether or not you think it's likely to be successful
sort of depends on what you think about
the chances of life in the universe.
I think, myself,
that life is a natural outgrowth
of the increasing complexification of matter over time.
and then you get helium, and then you get more complicated stuff,
and you get planets forming --
and life is a common, planetary-based phenomenon, in my view.
Certainly, in the last 15 years,
we've seen increasing numbers of planets
outside of our solar system being confirmed,
and just last month, a couple of weeks ago,
a planet in the size-class of Earth
has actually been found.
And so this is very exciting news.
is that in the universe, life is going to be everywhere.
It's going to be everywhere we look --
where there are planetary systems that can possibly support it.
And those planetary systems are going to be very common.
So, what about life on Mars?
Well, if somebody had asked me about a dozen years ago
what I thought the chances of life on Mars would be,
I would've probably said, a couple of percent.
And even that was considered outrageous at the time.
I was once sneeringly introduced
by a former NASA official,
as the only person on the planet
who still thought there was life on Mars.
Of course, that official is now dead, and I'm not,
so there's a certain amount of glory
in outliving your adversaries.
over the last dozen years.
And the reason that they have changed
is because we now have new information.
The amazing Pathfinder mission that went in '97,
and the MER Rover missions
that are on Mars as we speak now
and the European Space Agency's Mars Express,
has taught us a number of amazing things.
There is sub-surface ice on that planet.
And so where there is water,
there is a very high chance of our kind of life.
There's clearly sedimentary rocks all over the place –
one of the landers is sitting in the middle of an ancient seabed,
and there are these amazing structures called blueberries,
which are these little, rocky concretions
that we are busy making biologically
in my lab right now.
I think that the chances of life
are much greater than I would've ever thought.
I think that the chance of life having arisen on Mars, sometime in its past,
is maybe one in four to maybe even half and half.
So this is a very bold statement.
I think it's there, and I think we need
to go look for it, and I think it's underground.
So the game's afoot, and this is the game that we play in astro-biology.
How do you try to get a handle on extraterrestrial life?
How do you plan to look for it?
How do you know it when you find it?
Because if it's big and obvious, we would've already found it --
it would've already bitten us on the foot, and it hasn't.
Very critically, how do we protect it,
if we find it, and not contaminate it?
And also, even perhaps more critically, because
this is the only home planet we have,
how do we protect us from it, while we study it?
So why might it be hard to find?
Well, it's probably microscopic, and it's never easy
to study microscopic things,
although the amazing tools that we now have to do that
allow us to study things in much greater depth,
at much smaller scales than ever before.
But it's probably hiding, because if you are out
sequestering resources from your environment, that makes you yummy,
and other things might want to eat you, or consume you.
And so, there's a game of predator-prey
that's going to be, essentially, universal, really,
in any kind of biological system.
It also may be very, very different in its fundamental properties –
its chemistry, or its size.
Is it virus-sized? Is it smaller than that?
Is it bigger than the biggest bacterium? We don't know.
And speed of activity, which is something that we face
in our work with sub-surface organisms,
because they grow very, very slowly.
If I were to take a swab off your teeth
and plate it on a Petri plate,
within about four or five hours, I would have to see growth.
But the organisms that we work with,
from the sub-surface of Earth,
very often it's months -- and in many cases, years --
before we see any growth whatsoever.
So they are, intrinsically, a slower life-form.
and until we can think out of the box of our cranium and what we know,
then we can't recognize what to look for,
or how to plan for it.
So, perspective is everything
and, because of the history that I've just briefly talked to you about,
I have learned to think about Earth
as an extraterrestrial planet.
And this has been invaluable in our approach to try to study these things.
where you're in an airplane and you look out the window,
you see the horizon.
I always turn my head on the side,
and that simple change makes me go from
seeing this planet as home,
to seeing it as a planet.
Well, this is what we apply to our work.
This shows one of the most extreme caves that we work in.
This is Cueva de Villa Luz in Tabasco, in Mexico,
and this cave is saturated with sulfuric acid.
There is tremendous amounts of hydrogen sulfide
coming into this cave from volcanic sources
and from the breakdown of evaporite --
minerals below the carbonates in which this cave is formed --
and it is a completely hostile environment for us.
We have to go in with protective suits and breathing gear,
and 30 parts per million of H2S will kill you.
This is regularly several hundred parts per million.
So, it's a very hazardous environment,
with CO as well, and many other gases.
These extreme physical and chemical parameters
make the biology that grows in these places very special.
Because contrary to what you might think, this is not devoid of life.
that we have found on the planet, anywhere.
It's bursting with life.
The extremes on Earth are interesting in their own right,
but one of the reasons that we're interested in them
is because they represent, really,
the average conditions that we may expect on other planets.
So, this is part of the ability that we have,
to try to stretch our imagination,
in terms of what we may find in the future.
There's so much life in this cave,
and I can't even begin
to scratch the surface of it with you.
are what we call Snottites, for obvious reasons.
This stuff looks like what comes out of your two-year-old's nose when he has a cold.
And this is produced by bacteria who are actually
making more sulfuric acid,
and living at pHs right around zero.
And so, this stuff is like battery acid.
And yet, everything in this cave has adapted to it.
In fact, there's so much energy available
for biology in this cave,
that there's actually a huge number of cavefish.
And the local Zoque Indians
harvest this twice a year,
as part of their Easter week celebration and Holy Week celebration.
In some of the other amazing caves that we work in --
this is in Lechuguilla cave in New Mexico near Carlsbad,
and this is one of the most famous caves in the world.
It's 115 miles of mapped passage,
it's pristine, it has no natural opening
and it's a gigantic biological,
geo-microbiological laboratory.
In this cave, great areas are covered by
this reddish material that you see here,
and also these enormous crystals
of selenite that you can see dangling down.
This stuff is produced biologically.
This is the breakdown product of the bedrock,
that organisms are busy munching their way through.
They take iron and manganese minerals
within the bedrock and they oxidize them.
And every time they do that, they get a tiny little packet of energy.
And that tiny little packet of energy is what they use, then,
to run their life processes.
Interestingly enough, they also do this
with uranium and chromium, and various other toxic metals.
for bio-remediation
comes from organisms like this.
These organisms we now bring into the lab,
and you can see some of them growing on Petri plates,
and get them to reproduce the precise biominerals
that we find on the walls of these caves.
So, these are signals that they leave in the rock record.
Well, even in basalt surfaces in lava-tube caves,
which are a by-product of volcanic activity,
we find these walls totally covered,
in many cases,
by these beautiful, glistening silver walls,
or shiny pink or shiny red or shiny gold.
And these are mineral deposits
that are also made by bacteria.
And you can see in these central images here,
scanning electron micrographs of some of these guys --
these are gardens of these bacteria.
is that they're in the actinomycete
and streptomycete groups of the bacteria,
which is where we get most of our antibiotics.
The sub-surface of Earth
contains a vast biodiversity.
And these organisms,
because they're very separate from the surface,
make a vast array of novel compounds.
And so, the potential for exploiting this
for pharmaceutical and industrial chemical uses
is completely untapped,
but probably exceeds most of the rest
of the biodiversity of the planet.
I've just told you about organisms that live here on this planet.
We know that on Mars and the Moon
there are tons of these structures.
We can see them.
On the left you can see a lava tube forming
at a recent eruption -- Mount Etna in Sicily --
and this is the way these tubes form.
And when they hollow out,
then they become habitats for organisms.
These are all over the planet Mars,
and we're busy cataloguing them now.
And so, there's very interesting cave real estate
on Mars, at least of that type.
these sub-surface environments that we're interested in,
we're very interested in developing the tools to do this.
You know, it's not easy to get into these caves.
It requires crawling, climbing,
rope-work, technical rope-work
and many other complex human motions
in order to access these.
We face the problem of, how can we do this robotically?
Why would we want to do it robotically?
Well, we're going to be sending
robotic missions to Mars
long in advance of human missions.
about the preciousness of any life that we may find
on Mars, we don't want to contaminate it.
And one of the best ways to study something without contaminating it
is to have an intermediary.
And in this case, we're imagining
intermediary robotic devices
that can actually do some of that
front-end work for us,
to protect any potential life that we find.
I'm not going to go through all of these projects now,
but we're involved in about half-a-dozen robotic development projects,
in collaboration with a number of different groups.
I want to talk specifically about the
array that you see on the top.
I'm working on this with the Field and Space Robotics Laboratory
and my friend Steve Dubowsky at MIT,
and we have come up with the idea
of having little, jumping bean-like
robots
that are propelled by artificial muscle,
which is one of the Dubowsky Lab's specialties --
are the EPAMs, or artificial muscles.
And these allow them to hop.
They behave with
a swarm behavior,
where they relate to each other,
modeled after insect swarm behavior,
and they could be made very numerous.
And so, one can send a thousand of them,
as you can see in this upper left-hand picture,
a thousand of them could fit into the payload bay
that was used for one of the current MER Rovers.
And these little guys -- you could lose many of them.
If you send a thousand of them,
you could probably get rid of 90 percent of them and still have a mission.
And so, that allows you the flexibility
to go into very challenging terrain
and actually make your way where you want to go.
about caves and the human expansion beyond Earth
as a natural outgrowth of the work that we do in caves.
It occurred to us a number of years ago
that caves have many properties
that people have used
and other organisms have used as habitat in the past.
And perhaps it's time we started to explore those,
in the context of future Mars and the Moon exploration.
looking at the irreducible set of technologies
that you would need in order to
actually allow people to inhabit lava tubes
on the Moon or Mars.
It turns out to be a fairly simple and small list,
and we have gone
in the relatively primitive technology direction.
So, we're talking about things like inflatable liners
that can conform to the complex topological shape
on the inside of a cave,
foamed-in-place airlocks to deal with this complex topology,
various ways of getting breathing gases
made from the intrinsic materials of these bodies.
And the future is there for us
to use these lava-tube caves on Mars.
And right now we're in caves, and we're doing science and recreation,
but I think in the future we'll be using them
for habitat and science on these other bodies.
of potential life on Mars is
that it's probably been on the planet,
maybe one in two chances.
The question as to whether
there is life on Mars that is related to life on Earth
has now been very muddied,
because we now know,
from Mars meteorites that have made it to Earth,
that there's material that can be exchanged between those two planets.
if we go there and find life in the sub-surface,
as I fully expect that we will,
is that a second genesis of life?
Did life start here
and was it transported there?
Did it start there and get transported here?
This will be a fascinating puzzle as we go into the next half-century,
and where I expect that we will
have more and more Mars missions to answer these questions.
Thank you.
a pride of ownership.
Songs are written about cars.
Prince wrote a great song: "Little Red Corvette."
He wrote about a car.
One of my favorites has always been:
"Make Love to Your Man in a Chevy Van,"
because that was my vehicle when I was in college.
But the fact remains:
the fundamental DNA of the automobile has stayed pretty much the same.
If we were to reinvent the automobile today, rather than 100 years ago,
one-tenth as many moving parts,
a fuel-cell propulsion system as an internal combustion engine,
and it emits just water.
First was Autonomy.
Autonomy really set the vision for where we wanted to head.
We embodied all of the key components of a fuel-cell propulsion system.
and we showed Hy-Wire here at this conference last year.
And Sequel truly is a real car.
it can come from any way that you can create electricity,
A lot of hydrogen is produced today in the world.
It's produced to get sulfur out of gasoline --
It's produced in the fertilizer industry;
it's produced in the chemical manufacturing industry.
That hydrogen is being made
because there's a good business reason for its use.
we know how to handle it safely.
where you would have a station in each city
with each of the 100 largest cities in the United States,
and located the stations
much like recharging your laptop or recharging your cell phone.
So we're pretty excited about the future of hydrogen.
We think it's a question of not whether, but a question of when.
We actually think the future is going to be event-driven.
So since we can't predict the future,
That's a huge power-generating capability,
a mobile power-generating capability.
And hydrogen and fuel cells give us that opportunity
to actually use our cars and trucks when they're parked
to generate electricity for the grid.
as well as a form of transportation.
to make it exciting,
And again, this is a pretty big march to take here.
I just want to ask one.
as some of your Japanese competitors, maybe even as Ford.
and not just, you know, when the consumers want it,
I'll be honest with you;
Do unto yourself before others do unto you.
Unless we do something to prevent it,
over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic
of neurologic diseases on a global scale.
A cheery thought.
On this map, every country that’s colored blue
has more than 20 percent of its population over the age of 65.
This is the world we live in.
And this is the world your children will live in.
For 12,000 years, the distribution of ages in the human population
has looked like a pyramid, with the oldest on top.
It’s already flattening out.
By 2050, it’s going to be a column and will start to invert.
This is why it’s happening.
The average lifespan’s more than doubled since 1840,
and it’s increasing currently at the rate of about five hours every day.
And this is why that’s not entirely a good thing:
because over the age of 65, your risk of getting Alzheimer’s
or Parkinson’s disease will increase exponentially.
By 2050, there’ll be about 32 million people in the United States
over the age of 80, and unless we do something about it,
half of them will have Alzheimer’s disease
and three million more will have Parkinson’s disease.
Right now, those and other neurologic diseases --
for which we have no cure or prevention --
cost about a third of a trillion dollars a year.
It will be well over a trillion dollars by 2050.
Alzheimer’s disease starts when a protein
that should be folded up properly
misfolds into a kind of demented origami.
So one approach we’re taking is to try to design drugs
that function like molecular Scotch tape,
to hold the protein into its proper shape.
That would keep it from forming the tangles
that seem to kill large sections of the brain when they do.
Interestingly enough, other neurologic diseases
which affect very different parts of the brain
also show tangles of misfolded protein,
which suggests that the approach might be a general one,
and might be used to cure many neurologic diseases,
not just Alzheimer’s disease.
There’s also a fascinating connection to cancer here,
because people with neurologic diseases
have a very low incidence of most cancers.
And this is a connection that most people aren’t pursuing right now,
but which we’re fascinated by.
Most of the important and all of the creative work in this area
is being funded by private philanthropies.
And there’s tremendous scope for additional private help here,
because the government has dropped the ball on much of this, I’m afraid.
In the meantime, while we’re waiting for all these things to happen,
here’s what you can do for yourself.
If you want to lower your risk of Parkinson’s disease,
caffeine is protective to some extent; nobody knows why.
Head injuries are bad for you. They lead to Parkinson’s disease.
And the Avian Flu is also not a good idea.
As far as protecting yourself against Alzheimer’s disease,
well, it turns out that fish oil has the effect
of reducing your risk for Alzheimer’s disease.
You should also keep your blood pressure down,
because chronic high blood pressure
is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease.
It’s also the biggest risk factor for glaucoma,
which is just Alzheimer’s disease of the eye.
And of course, when it comes to cognitive effects,
"use it or lose it" applies,
so you want to stay mentally stimulated.
But hey, you’re listening to me.
So you’ve got that covered.
And one final thing. Wish people like me luck, okay?
Because the clock is ticking for all of us.
Thank you.
These rocks have been hitting our earth for about three billion years,
and are responsible for much of what’s gone on on our planet.
This is an example of a real meteorite,
and you can see all the melting of the iron
from the speed and the heat when a meteorite hits the earth,
and just how much of it survives and melts.
From a meteorite from space,
we’re over here with an original Sputnik.
This is one of the seven surviving Sputniks that was not launched into space.
This is not a copy.
The space age began 50 years ago in October,
and that’s exactly what Sputnik looked like.
without seeing a flag that was carried
to the moon and back, on Apollo 11.
The astronauts each got to carry
about ten silk flags in their personal kits.
They would bring them back and mount them.
So this has actually been carried to the moon
and back.
So that’s for fun.
And it wouldn’t be interesting to talk about the dawn of books
without having a copy of a Guttenberg Bible.
You can see how portable and handy it was to have your own Guttenberg
in 1455.
But what’s interesting about the Guttenberg Bible, and the dawn of this technology,
is not the book.
You see, the book was not driven by reading.
In 1455, nobody could read.
So why did the printing press succeed?
This is an original page of a Guttenberg Bible.
So you’re looking here at one of the first printed books
using movable type in the history of man,
550 years ago.
We are living at the age here at the end of the book,
where electronic paper will undoubtedly replace it.
It turns out that in the 1450s,
the Catholic Church needed money,
and so they
actually hand-wrote these things called indulgences,
which were forgiveness’s on pieces of paper.
They traveled all around Europe
and sold by the hundreds or by the thousands.
They got you out of purgatory faster.
And when the printing press was invented
what they found was they could print indulgences,
which was the equivalent of printing money.
to print out thousands,
and then hundreds of thousands,
and then ultimately millions
of single, small pieces of paper
that got you out of middle hell and into heaven.
That is why the printing press succeeded,
and that is why Martin Luther
nailed his 90 theses to the door:
because he was complaining that the Catholic Church had gone amok
in printing out indulgences and selling them
in every town and village and city in all of Western Europe.
was driven entirely by the printing of forgivenesses
and had nothing to do with reading.
More tomorrow. I also have pictures coming of the library
for those of you that have asked for pictures.
We’re going to have some tomorrow.
(Applause)
I’m going to do something special for the first time.
We are going to show, actually, what the library looks like, OK?
So, I am married to the most wonderful woman in the world.
You’re going to find out why in a minute,
because when I went to see Eileen,
this is what I said I wanted to build.
The room itself is three stories tall.
In the glass panels are 5,000 years of human imagination
that are computer controlled.
The room is a theatre. It changes colors.
And all throughout the library are different objects, different spaces.
It’s designed like an Escher print.
Here is some of the lower level of the library,
where the exhibits constantly change.
You can walk through. You can touch.
You can see exactly how many of these types of items would fit in a room.
There’s my very own Saturn V.
Everybody should have one, OK? (Laughter)
So you can see here in the lower level of the library
the books and the objects.
In the glass panels all along is sort of the history of imagination.
There is a glass bridge that you walk across
that’s suspended in space.
So it’s a leap of imagination.
Part of the question that I have answered is,
is we create by surrounding ourselves with stimuli:
with human achievement, with history,
with the things that drive us and make us human --
the passionate discovery, the bones of dinosaurs long gone,
the maps of space that we’ve experienced,
and ultimately the hallways that stimulate our mind and our imagination.
one or two more objects from the stage,
but for today I just wanted to say thank you
for all the people that came and talked to us about it.
And Eileen and I are thrilled to open our home
and share it with the TED community.
(Applause)
TED is all about patterns in the clouds.
It’s all about connections.
It’s all about seeing things
that everybody else has seen before
but thinking about them in ways that nobody has thought of them before.
And that’s really what discovery and imagination is all about.
at a DNA molecule model here.
None of us really have ever seen one,
but we know it exists because we’ve been taught
to understand this molecule.
But we can also look at an Enigma machine
from the Nazis in World War II
that was a coding and decoding machine.
Now, you might say, what does this have to do with this?
Well, this is the code for life,
and this is a code for death.
These two molecules
code and decode.
And yet, looking at them, you would see a machine and a molecule.
But once you’ve seen them in a new way,
you realize that both of these things really are connected.
And they’re connected primarily because of this here.
And it’s rare, because we never really get to see a brain.
We get to see a skull. But there it is.
All of imagination -- everything that we think,
we feel, we sense -- comes through the human brain.
And once we create new patterns in this brain,
once we shape the brain in a new way,
it never returns to its original shape.
We think about the Internet;
we think about information that goes across the Internet.
And we never think about the hidden connection.
But I brought along here a lump of coal --
right here, one lump of coal.
And what does a lump of coal have to do with the Internet?
You see, it takes the energy in one lump of coal
to move one megabyte of information across the net.
So every time you download a file,
each megabyte is a lump of coal.
What that means is, a 200-megabyte file
looks like this, ladies and gentlemen. OK?
So the next time you download a gigabyte,
or two gigabytes, it’s not for free, OK?
The connection is the energy it takes to run the web ,
and to make everything we think possible, possible.
Thanks, Chris.
(Applause)
So I understand that this meeting was planned,
and the slogan was From Was to Still.
And I am illustrating Still.
Which, of course, I am not agreeing with because,
although I am 94, I am not still working.
And anybody who asks me, "Are you still doing this or that?"
I don't answer because I'm not doing things still, I'm doing it like I always did.
I still have -- or did I use the word still? I didn't mean that.
I have my clients. I am doing my work like I always did.
So this takes care of my age.
I want to show you my work so you know what I am doing and why I am here.
This was about 1925.
All of these things were made during the last 75 years.
doing more or less what you see here. This is Castleton China.
This was an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.
This is now for sale at the Metropolitan Museum.
This is still at the Metropolitan Museum now for sale.
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself.
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years.
I call myself a maker of things.
I don't call myself an industrial designer because I'm other things.
Industrial designers want to make novel things.
Novelty is a concept of commerce, not an aesthetic concept.
The industrial design magazine, I believe, is called "Innovation."
Innovation is not part of the aim of my work.
Well, makers of things: they make things more beautiful, more elegant,
more comfortable than just the craftsmen do.
I have so much to say. I have to think what I am going to say.
Well, to describe our profession otherwise,
we are actually concerned with the playful search for beauty.
That means the playful search for beauty was called the first activity of Man.
Sarah Smith, who was a mathematics professor at MIT, wrote,
"The playful search for beauty was Man's first activity --
that all useful qualities and all material qualities
were developed from the playful search for beauty."
These are tiles. The word, "playful" is a necessary aspect of our work
because, actually, one of our problems is that we have to make,
produce, lovely things throughout all of life, and this for me is now 75 years.
make things with the same pleasure, as a gift to others, for so long?
The playful is therefore an important part of our quality as designer.
Let me tell you some about my life.
As I said, I started to do these things 75 years ago.
My first exhibition in the United States
was at the Sesquicentennial exhibition in 1926 --
that the Hungarian government sent one of my hand-drawn pieces as part of the exhibit.
My work actually took me through many countries,
and showed me a great part of the world.
This is not that they took me -- the work didn't take me --
I made the things particularly because I wanted to use them to see the world.
I was incredibly curious to see the world, and I made all these things,
which then finally did take me to see many countries and many cultures.
I started as an apprentice to a Hungarian craftsman,
and this taught me what the guild system was in Middle Ages.
I had to apprentice myself in order to become a pottery master.
In my shop where I studied, or learned, there was a traditional hierarchy
of master, journeyman and learned worker, and apprentice,
and I worked as the apprentice.
The work as an apprentice was very primitive.
That means I had to actually learn every aspect of making pottery by hand.
We mashed the clay with our feet when it came from the hillside.
After that, it had to be kneaded. It had to then go in, kind of, a mangle.
And then finally it was prepared for the throwing.
And there I really worked as an apprentice.
My master took me to set ovens
because this was part of oven-making, oven-setting, in the time.
And finally, I had received a document
that I had accomplished my apprenticeship successfully,
that I had behaved morally, and this document was given to me
by the Guild of Roof-Coverers, Rail-Diggers, Oven-Setters,
Chimney Sweeps and Potters.
and my working conditions, and I still have that workbook.
First I set up a shop in my own garden,
and made pottery which I sold on the marketplace in Budapest.
And there I was sitting, and my then-boyfriend --
I didn't mean it was a boyfriend like it is meant today --
but my boyfriend and I sat at the market and sold the pots.
My mother thought that this was not very proper,
so she sat with us to add propriety to this activity.
a pottery factory, a large one.
And I visited it with several ladies, and asked all sorts of questions of the director.
Then the director asked me, why do you ask all these questions?
I said, I also have a pottery.
So he asked me, could he please visit me, and then finally he did,
and explained to me that what I did now in my shop was an anachronism,
that the industrial revolution had broken out,
and that I rather should join the factory.
There he made an art department for me where I worked for several months.
However, everybody in the factory spent his time at the art department.
The director there said there were several women casting
and producing my designs now in molds, and this was sold also to America.
However, the director, the chemist, model maker -- everybody --
concerned himself much more with the art department --
that means, with my work -- than making toilets,
so finally they got a letter from the center, from the bank who owned the factory,
saying, make toilet-setting behind the art department, and that was my end.
So this gave me the possibility because now I was a journeyman,
and journeymen also take their satchel and go to see the world.
So as a journeyman, I put an ad into the paper that I had studied,
that I was a down-to-earth potter's journeyman
and I was looking for a job as a journeyman.
And I got several answers, and I accepted the one
which was farthest from home and practically, I thought, halfway to America.
Then I first took this job in Hamburg, at an art pottery
where everything was done on the wheel,
and so I worked in a shop where there were several potters.
And the first day, I was coming to take my place at the turntable --
there were three or four turntables -- and one of them, behind where I was sitting,
was a hunchback, a deaf-mute hunchback, who smelled very bad.
So I doused him in cologne every day, which he thought was very nice,
and therefore he brought bread and butter every day,
which I had to eat out of courtesy.
The first day I came to work in this shop
there was on my wheel a surprise for me.
My colleagues had thoughtfully put on the wheel where I was supposed to work
a very nicely modeled natural man's organs.
(Laughter)
After I brushed them off with a hand motion, they were very --
I finally was now accepted, and worked there for some six months.
This was my first job.
If I go on like this, you will be here till midnight.
I have to tell you that within five minutes I will talk very fast.
And actually, my work took me to many countries
because I used my work to fill my curiosity.
And among other things, other countries I worked, was in the Soviet Union,
where I worked from '32 to '37 -- actually, to '36.
I was finally there, although I had nothing to do -- I was a foreign expert.
I became art director of the china and glass industry,
and eventually under Stalin's purges -- at the beginning of Stalin's purges,
I didn't know that hundreds of thousands of innocent people were arrested.
So I was arrested quite early in Stalin's purges,
and spent 16 months in a Russian prison.
The accusation was that I had successfully prepared an Attentat on Stalin's life.
This was a very dangerous accusation.
And if this is the end of my five minutes, I want to tell you that
I actually did survive, which was a surprise.
But since I survived and I'm here,
and since this is the end of the five minutes, I will --
Weren't you there recently?
the Lomonosov factory was bought by an American company, invited me.
They found out that I had worked in '33 at this factory,
and they came to my studio in Rockland County,
and brought the 15 of their artists to visit me here.
And they invited myself to come to the Russian factory last summer,
in July, to make some dishes, design some dishes.
And since I don't like to travel alone, they also invited my daughter,
son-in-law and granddaughter,
so we had a lovely trip to see Russia today,
which is not a very pleasant and happy view.
Here I am now, if this is the end? Thank you.
With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu --
and we'll hear about that from the
brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today --
I want to talk about the other pandemic, which is
cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypertension --
all of which are completely preventable for at
least 95 percent of people
just by changing diet and lifestyle.
globalization of illness occurring, that people
are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and
die like us. And in one generation, for example,
Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of
heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one
of the highest. And in Africa, cardiovascular disease
equals the HIV and AIDS deaths
in most countries.
So there's a critical window of opportunity we
have to make an important difference that can
affect the lives of literally millions of people,
and practice preventive medicine on a global
scale.
people -- not only in this country, but also
worldwide -- than everything else combined, and yet
it's completely preventable for almost everybody.
It's not only preventable; it's actually
reversible. And for the last almost 29 years,
we've been able to show that by simply changing
diet and lifestyle, using these very high-tech,
expensive, state-of-the-art measures to prove how
powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost
interventions can be like -- quantitative
arteriography, before and after a year, and
cardiac PET scans.
first study showing you can actually stop or
reverse the progression of prostate cancer by
making changes in diet and lifestyle, and 70 percent
regression in the tumor growth, or inhibition of
the tumor growth, compared to only nine percent in the
control group.
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here, the
prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can
see it diminishing after a year.
adults and 15 percent of kids. What's really concerning
to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the
past 10 years, and this may be the first
generation in which our kids live a shorter life
span than we do. That's pitiful, and it's
preventable.
Now these are not election returns, these are the
people -- the number of the people who are obese
by state, beginning in '85, '86, '87 -- these are
from the CDC website -- '88, '89, '90, '91 -- you
get a new category -- '92, '93, '94, '95, '96,
'97, '98, '99, 2000, 2001 -- it gets worse. We're
kind of devolving. (Laughter)
diet that we've found that can reverse heart
disease and cancer is an Asian diet.
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we
are, which is why they're starting to get sick
like we are.
So I've been working with a lot of the big food
companies. They can make it fun and sexy and hip
and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods,
like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald's,
and PepsiCo, and ConAgra, and Safeway, and soon
Del Monte, and they're finding that it's good
business.
The salads that you see at McDonald's came from
the work -- they're going to have an Asian salad. At
Pepsi, two-thirds of their revenue growth came
from their better foods.
resources for buying drugs that you really do need
for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for
What I'd like you to do is, just really quickly,
is just, sort of, nod to the person on your right,
and then nod to the person on your left.
(Laughter)
Now, chances are that over the last winter,
if you had been a beehive, either you or one of the two people
you just nodded at would have died.
Now, that's an awful lot of bees.
And this is the second year in a row we have lost over 30 percent
of the colonies, or we estimate we've lost 30 percent of the colonies over the winter.
And most of those losses are because of things we know.
We know that there are these varroa mites that have introduced
and caused a lot of losses, and we also have this new phenomenon,
which I talked about last year, Colony Collapse Disorder.
And here we see a picture on top of a hill in Central Valley last December.
And below, you can see all these out yards,
or temporary yards, where the colonies are brought in until February,
and then they're shipped out to the almonds.
And one documentary writer, who was here and looked at this two months
after I was here, described this not as beehives
but as a graveyard, with these empty white boxes with no bees left in them.
to say that we have been trying to figure out
what the cause of this is.
And what we know is that it's as if the bees have caught a flu.
And this flu has wiped through the population of bees.
In some cases, and in fact in most cases in one year,
this flu was caused by a new virus to us,
or newly identified by us, called Israeli Acute Paralysis virus.
It was called that because a guy in Israel first found it,
and he now regrets profoundly calling it that disease, because,
of course, there's the implication.
But we think this virus is pretty ubiquitous.
It's also pretty clear that the bees sometimes catch other viruses
or other flus, and so the question we're still struggling with,
and the question that keeps us up at night,
is why have the bees suddenly become so susceptible to this flu,
and why are they so susceptible to these other diseases?
And we don't have the answer to that yet,
and we spend a lot of time trying to figure that out.
We think perhaps it's a combination of factors.
We know from the work of a very large and dynamic working team
that, you know, we're finding a lot of different pesticides
in the hive, and surprisingly, sometimes the healthiest hives
have the most pesticides. And so we discover all these
very strange things that we can't begin to understand.
Now of course, if you lose a lot of colonies,
beekeepers can replace them very quickly.
And that's why we've been able to recover from a lot of loss.
If we lost one in every three cows in the winter, you know,
the National Guard would be out.
But what beekeepers can do is, if they have one surviving colony,
they can split that colony in two.
And then the one half that doesn't have a queen, they can buy a queen.
It comes in the mail; it can come from Australia or Hawaii or Florida,
and you can introduce that queen.
And in fact, America was the first country
that ever did mail-delivery queens and in fact,
it's part of the postal code that you have to deliver queens by mail
in order to make sure that we have enough bees in this country.
If you don't just want a queen, you can buy, actually,
a three-pound package of bees, which comes in the mail, and of course,
the Postal Office is always very concerned when they get,
you know, your three-pound packages of bees.
And you can install this in your hive and replace that dead-out.
So it means that beekeepers are very good at replacing dead-outs,
and so they've been able to cover those losses.
So even though we've lost 30 percent of the colonies every year,
the same number of colonies have existed in the country,
at about 2.4 million colonies.
and one of those fronts is for the beekeeper.
And it's really important to talk about beekeepers first,
because beekeepers are among the most fascinating people you'll ever meet.
If this was a group of beekeepers, you would have everyone
from the card-carrying NRA member who's, you know, live free or die,
to the, you know, the self-expressed quirky San Francisco
backyard pig farmer.
(Laughter)
And you get all of these people in the same room,
and they're all engaged and they're getting along,
and they're all there because of the passion for bees.
Now, there's another part of that community
which are the commercial beekeepers,
the ones who make their livelihood from beekeeping alone.
And these tend to be some of the most independent, tenacious,
intuitive, you know, inventive people you will ever meet.
They're just fascinating. And they're like that all over the world.
And Haiti, if you've ever been there, is just a tragedy.
I mean, there may be 100 explanations
for why Haiti is the impoverished nation it is,
but there is no excuse to see that sort of squalor.
But you meet this beekeeper, and I met this beekeeper here,
and he is one of the most knowledgeable beekeepers I've ever met.
No formal education, but very knowledgeable.
We needed beeswax for a project we were working on; he was so capable,
he was able to render the nicest block of beeswax I have ever seen
from cow dung, tin cans and his veil, which he used as a screening,
right in this meadow. And so that ingenuity is inspiring.
He's the one who first identified this condition
and raised the alarm bells.
And he has a history of these trucks,
and he's moved these bees up and down the coast.
And a lot of people talk about trucks and moving bees,
and that being bad, but we've done that for thousands of years.
The ancient Egyptians used to move bees up and down the Nile on rafts,
so this idea of a movable bee force is not new at all.
And one of our real worries with Colony Collapse Disorder
is the fact that it costs so much money to replace those dead-out colonies.
And you can do that one year in a row,
you may be able to do it two years in a row.
But if you're losing 50 percent to 80 percent of your colonies,
you can't survive three years in a row. And we're really worried
about losing this segment of our industry.
and one of them is because of that culture that's in agriculture.
And these migratory beekeepers are the last nomads of America.
You know, they pick up their hives;
they move their families once or twice in a year.
And if you look at Florida, in Dade City, Florida,
that's where all the Pennsylvania beekeepers go.
And then 20 miles down the road is Groveland,
and that's where all the Wisconsin beekeepers go.
And if you're ever in Central Valley in February, you go to this café
at 10 o'clock in the morning, Kathy and Kate's.
And that's where all the beekeepers come after a night of moving bees
into the almond groves.
They all have their breakfast
and complain about everyone right there. And it's a great experience,
and I really encourage you to drop in at that diner during that time,
because that's quite essential American experience.
And we see these families, these nomadic families, you know,
father to son, father to son, and these guys are hurting.
And they're not people who like to ask for help,
although they are the most helpful people ever.
If there's one guy who loses all his bees because of a truck overhaul,
everyone pitches in and gives 20 hives
to help him replace those lost colonies.
And so, it's a very dynamic, and I think,
historic and exciting community to be involved with.
And although I highly encourage you, all use honey.
I mean, it's the most ethical sweetener,
and you know, it's a dynamic and fun sweetener.
But we estimate that about one in three bites of food we eat
is directly or indirectly pollinated by honeybees.
Now, I want to just illustrate that in the fact
that if we look at the breakfast I had yesterday morning --
a little cranberry juice, some fruits, some granola,
I should have had whole wheat bread, I realized, but you know,
jam on my Wonderbread, and some coffee --
and had we taken out all those ingredients,
-- except for the almonds I wasn't going to pick out from the granola --
if we had taken out all those ingredients
the bees had indirectly or directly pollinated,
we wouldn't have much on our plate.
So if we did not have bees, it's not like we would starve,
but clearly our diet would be diminished.
It's said that for bees, the flower is the fountain of life,
and for flowers bees are the messengers of love.
bees are the sex workers for flowers. They are, you know --
they get paid for their services.
They get paid by pollen and nectar,
to move that male sperm, the pollen, from flower to flower.
And there are flowers that are self-infertile. That means they can't --
the pollen in their bloom can't fertilize themselves.
So in an apple orchard, for instance, you'll have rows of 10 apples
of one variety, and then you have another apple tree
that's a different type of pollen.
And bees are very faithful.
When they're out pollinating or gathering pollen from one flower,
they stay to that crop exclusively, in order to help generate.
And of course, they're made to carry this pollen.
They build up a static electric charge and the pollen jumps on them
and helps spread that pollen from bloom to bloom.
Honeybees are not native to America; they were introduced
with the colonialists.
And there are actually more species of bees
than there are mammals and birds combined.
In Pennsylvania alone, we have been surveying bees for 150 years,
and very intensely in the last three years.
We have identified over 400 species of bees in Pennsylvania.
Thirty-two species have not been identified or found in the state since 1950.
Now, that could be because we haven't been sampling right,
but it does, I think, suggest that something's wrong
with the pollinator force. And these bees are fascinating.
And bumblebees are what we call eusocial: they're not truly social,
because only the queen is, over winter.
We also have the sweat bees, and these are little gems flying around.
They're like tiny little flies and they fly around.
And then you have another type of bee, which we call kleptoparasites,
which is a very fancy way of saying, bad-minded, murdering --
what's the word I'm looking for? Murdering --
Audience: Bee?
Dennis vanEngelsdorp: Bee. Okay, thanks.
(Laughter)
What these bees do is, they sit there. These solitary bees,
they drill a hole in the ground or drill a hole in a branch,
and they collect pollen and make it into a ball,
and they lay an egg on it.
Well, these bees hang out at that hole,
and they wait for that mother to fly away, they go in, eat the egg,
and lay their own egg there. So they don't do any work.
And so, in fact, if you know you have these kleptoparasitic bees,
you know that your environment is healthy,
because they're top-of-the-food-chain bees.
And in fact, there is now a red list of pollinators
that we're worried have disappeared, and on top of that list
are a lot of these kleptoparasites, but also these bumblebees.
And in fact, if you guys live on the West Coast,
go to these websites here, and they're really looking for people
to look for some of these bumblebees, because we think
some have gone extinct. Or some, the population has declined.
but we don't understand these native pollinators
or all those other parts of our community.
And of course, bees are not the only important factor here.
There are other animals that pollinate, like bats,
and bats are in trouble too.
And I'm glad I'm a bee man and not a bat man,
because there's no money to research the bat problems.
And bats are dying at an extraordinary rate.
White-nose syndrome has wiped out populations of bats.
If there's a cave in New York that had 15,000 bats in it,
and there are 1,000 left. That's like San Francisco
becoming the population of half of this county in three years.
And so that's incredible. And there's no money to do that.
of all these conditions, and that cause is NDD:
Nature Deficit Disorder.
And that is that I think that what we have in our society is,
we forgot our connection with nature.
And I think if we reconnect to nature,
we'll be able to have the resources and that interest
to solve these problems.
And I think that there is an easy cure for NDD.
And that is, make meadows and not lawns.
And I think we have lost our connection,
and this is a wonderful way of reconnecting to our environment.
I've had the privilege of living by a meadow
for the last little while, and it is terribly engaging.
And if we look at the history of lawns, it's actually rather tragic.
It used to be, two, three hundred years ago,
that a lawn was a symbol of prestige,
and so it was only the very rich that could keep these green
actually, deserts: they're totally sterile.
Americans spent, in 2001 -- 11 percent of all pesticide use was done on lawns.
Five percent of our greenhouse gases are produced by mowing our lawns.
keeping our lawns, which are these useless biosystems.
And so we need to rethink this idea.
In fact, you know, the White House
used to have sheep in front in order to help fund
the war effort in World War I, which probably is not a bad idea;
it wouldn't be a bad idea.
I want to say this not because I'm opposed completely to mowing lawns.
I think that there is perhaps some advantage to keeping lawns
at a limited scale, and I think we're encouraged to do that.
But I also want to reinforce some of the ideas we've heard here,
because having a meadow or living by a meadow is transformational.
That it is amazing that connection we can have with what's there.
These milkweed plants have grown up in my meadow
over the last four years. Add to watch the different plants,
or insects, that come to these flowers, to watch that --
and we've heard about, you know, this relationship you can have with wine,
this companion you can have as it matures
and as it has these different fragrances.
And this is a companion,
and this is a relationship that never dries up.
You never run out of that companion as you drink this wine, too.
And I encourage you to look at that.
or lawns that we can convert, and so you can always, of course,
grow a meadow in a pot.
Bees apparently, can be the gateway to, you know, other things.
So I'm not saying that you should plant a meadow of pot,
but a pot in a meadow.
But you can also have this great community of city
or building-top beekeepers, these beekeepers that live --
This is in Paris where these beekeepers live.
And everyone should open a beehive,
because it is the most amazing, incredible thing.
And if we want to cure ourselves of NDD, or Nature Deficit Disorder,
I think this is a great way of doing it.
Get a beehive and grow a meadow,
and watch that life come back into your life.
And so with that, I think that what we can do, if we do this,
we can make sure that our future -- our more perfect future --
includes beekeepers and it includes bees and it includes those meadows.
And that journey -- that journey of transformation that occurs
as you grow your meadow and as you keep your bees
or you watch those native bees there -- is an extremely exciting one.
And I hope that you experience it
and I hope you tell me about it one day.
So thank you very much for being here. Thank you very much.
(Music: "The Sound of Silence," Simon & Garfunkel)
I ignored my boss's warning.
I called on a Monday morning.
Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.
I'm still on hold.
I'm listening to the sounds of silence.
I don't think you understand.
I think your phone lines are unmanned.
I punched every touch tone I was told,
but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac,
and it constantly hangs and bombs --
it erased my ROMs!
Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.
In my dreams I fantasize
of wreaking vengeance on you guys.

So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.
The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is,
they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.
And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.
get a New York Times column,
because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.
And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.
People are feeling like things --
Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.
Lucky you can't see it.
People are feeling overwhelmed.
They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.
It may be good technology,
but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.
There's not enough help.
There's not enough thought put into the design of it
to make it easy and enjoyable to use.
One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support,
and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages
from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website,
from users saying,
""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."
I call it "software rage."
And man, let me tell you,
whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will --
Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.
And part of the problem is, ironically,
because the industry has put so much thought
into making things easier to use.
I'll show you what I mean.
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.
This is the original Mac operating system.
Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.
And the entire operating system --

"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"
Uh-uh.
Your call may be recorded
so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories
and pass them around on a CD.
With your voices on it!
A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking.
Making a squeaking noise.
And the technician said,
the faster I move it across the screen."
"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true --
his computer had crashed, and he told the technician
he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."
And the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?"
He said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'"
that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.
But why is the technical overload crisis,
the complexity crisis, accelerating now?
everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.
So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier,
but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.
So it gets to be more and more of a challenge.
Software is subject to another primal force:
the mandate to release more and more versions.
When you buy a piece of software,
it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.
It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year,
and every year, they say,
"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue
from just these software upgrades.
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --
which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times,
you eventually ruin it.
the Eisenhower administration.
Microsoft actually did this experiment.
They said, "Well, wait a minute.
Everyone complains that we're adding so many features.
Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor:
Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."
And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write.
And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.
It tanked. No one ever bought it.
I call this the Sport Utility Principle.
People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like,
"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."
So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?
Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.
You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.
But if you're not careful about how you choose,
you wind up with this.
un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,
the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.
You've obviously never opened all the toolbars,
but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.
where there are so many features and options,
you have to do two dimensions, you know:
a vertical and a horizontal.
You guys all complain
about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists
and underlining your links automatically.
The off switch is in there somewhere.
I'm telling you -- it's there.
Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface,
is knowing when to use which one of these features.
So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.
There are only four choices,
so why are they in a pop-up menu?
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components
that you need to collapse the choices.
They could have put them all out in view.
Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft
have a severely divergent approach to software design.
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be:
let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.
There are these "wizards" everywhere.
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.
If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling
where they might wind up.
Ok, I'll bite.
Let's click "Next" to continue.
So what is the answer?
How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?
I believe in consistency, when possible,
real-world equivalents,
trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.
But I beg of the designers here
to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all,
which is intelligence.
Now what do I mean by that?
I'm going to give you some examples
where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.
you're supposed to put in your address,
and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?
There are 200 countries in the world.
We like to think of the Internet as a global village.
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.
It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.
So why is "United States" in the "U"s?
Now, it would be inconsistent to put "United States" first,
but it would be intelligent.
but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC
by clicking a button called "Start?"
Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document,
in page order, on that printer.
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.
the cult of simplicity.
Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.
I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s,
and after the talk, I met one of the employees.
He says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you. What do you do here?"
He said, "I'm a tap counter." I'm like, "You're a what?"
He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says,
'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus,
it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.'
So I'm the tap counter."
So, I'm going to show you an example
of a company that does not have a tap counter.
Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word --
it could happen.
Now, what happens when you choose "New?"
Do you get a new blank document?
You do not.
On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears,
and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top --
somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.
Ok, so that is a company not counting taps.
You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...
Yes, I do.
and I wrote the very first DOS.
I put my software and IBM together;
I got profit and they got the loss.
I'm getting royalties from everyone.
Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.
You buy the box; I'll sell the code.
Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D.
You can't keep a good idea down these days.
Even Windows is a hack.
We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.
So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go.
I'm not doing this for praise.
I write the code that fits the world today.
Big mediocrity in every way.
We've entered planet domination mode.
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.
I am Bill Gates and I write the code.
There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.
They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff
locks into the old 1982 chassis.
But there's also a new Microsoft,
that's really doing good, simple interface designs.
I liked the Media Center PC.
I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.
The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market,
but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.
But let's put it this way:
would you pay $10 a month to have a watch
that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone,
and stops working when you leave your area code?
that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.
So is there any hope?
The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating,
putting manuals in the boxes,
things are coming out at a faster pace.
It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997,
after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo --
he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans,
and he sort of did this.
The crowd went wild, but I had just seen --
I'm like, where have I seen this before?
I had just seen the movie "Evita" --
and I'm like, you know what?
I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.
after telling the press Apple's future is black.
You won't believe me.
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage
with only a buddy named Woz.
I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.
I made a fortune over at Pixar.
I've still got the drive and vision.
I still wear sandals in any weather.
It's just that these days,
they're Gucci leather.
And the truth is,
for years I was a little depressed,
because Americans obviously did not value it,
because the Mac had three percent market share,
Windows had 95 percent market share --
people did not think it was worth putting a price on it.
So I was a little depressed.
And then I heard Al Gore's talk,
and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.
Because the iPod came out,
and it violated every bit of common wisdom.
Other products cost less; other products had more features,
they had voice recorders and FM transmitters.
The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard,
not Apple's propriety standard.
But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted.
The lesson was: simplicity sells.
And there are signs that the industry is getting the message.
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.
The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.
Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately.
When you have a digital camera,
how do you get the pictures back to your computer?
Well, you either haul around a USB cable,
or you buy a card reader and haul that around.
Either one, you're going to lose.
What I do is, I take out the memory card,
and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures,
put it right back in the camera.
I never have to lose anything.
Here's another example.
Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?
You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor.
It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.
I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.
And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet
because the software is nervous.
Speech recognition software is really great
for doing emails very quickly; period.
Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period.
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.
I also use this feature called voice macros; period.
Correct "dissuade."
Not "just."
Ok, this is not an ideal situation,
because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.
The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word,
and having it write out a much longer thing.
So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say,
"Thanks for that."
which happens daily --
I say, "Piss off."
This is version eight of this software,
and do you know what they put in version eight?
No new features. It's never happened before in software!
The company put no new features.
They just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right?
Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out --
95 percent accuracy was all they got,
which means one in 20 words is wrong --
and they'd put it in their drawer.
And the company got sick of that,
And so that's what they did.
So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology:
remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?
It could be the design of the thing you're using.
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.
And if you're among the people who create this stuff:
Easy is hard.
Pre-sweat the details for your audience.
Count the taps.
Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add,
it's deciding what to leave out.
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.
She was 105 years old when I took this picture.
(Laughter)
She said, "Be good to your friends.
Let's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together.
And I'm going to have Michael Manring play bass with me.
Give him a big old hand.
(Applause)
if I don't see her, I go crazy.
a few more jumps and I'll be with her.
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.
I'd go up and learn these old songs from her.
She couldn't sing much, couldn't play anymore.
And I'd pull her out on the front porch.
Down below, there was her grandson plowing the tobacco field with a mule.
A double outhouse over here on the side.
And we'd sing this old song. She didn't have a whole lot of energy,
so I'd sing, "Hey, hey!" and she'd just answer back with, "Black-eyed Susie."
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.
She got mad; I took a licking.
Devil in the pretty girl when she takes a notion.
Hey, hey black-eyed Susie, hey.
I'll lay around; she'll make a living.
we'll have chicken someday, maybe.
Oh, hey, hey, black-eyed Susie! Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie!
Hey, hey, black-eyed Susie, hey.
Thank you, Michael.
When I was going to college at University of California
at Santa Barbara in the College of Creative Studies,
taking majors in biology and art, he came to the campus.
This was in 1968, I guess it was.
And he played his bluegrass style of music,
but near the end of the concert, he played the old timing style of banjo picking
that came from Africa, along with the banjo.
It's called claw-hammer style, that he had learned from his mother and grandmother.
I fell in love with that.
I went up to him and said, how can I learn that?
He said, well, you can go back to Clinch Mountain, where I'm from,
or Asheville or Mount Airy, North Carolina --
some place that has a lot of music.
Because there's a lot of old people still living that play that old style.
I just fell in love with the culture and the people.
And you know, I came back to school, I finished my degrees
and told my parents I wanted to be a banjo player.
You can imagine how excited they were.
I've taken of some of my mentors.
Just a few of them, but maybe you'll get just a little hint of some of these folks.
(Music)
Those last few pictures were of Ray Hicks, who just passed away last year.
He was one of the great American folk tale-tellers.
The Old Jack tales that he had learned -- he talked like this,
you could hardly understand him. But it was really wonderful.
And he lived in that house that his great-grandfather had built.
No running water, no electricity. A wonderful, wonderful guy.
I've actually got a website that's got a bunch of photos that I've done
of some of the other folks I didn't get a chance to show you.
This instrument came up in those pictures. It's called the mouth bow.
It is definitely the first stringed instrument ever in the world,
and still played in the Southern mountains.
Now, the old timers didn't take a fancy guitar string and make anything like this.
They would just take a stick and a catgut and string it up.
It was hard on the cats, but it made a great little instrument.
It sounds something like this.
Well, have you heard the many stories told by young and old with joy
about the many deeds of daring that were done by the Johnson boys?
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
they were known both far and wide.
You take Kate, I'll take Sal; we'll both have a Johnson gal.
(Applause)
We were driving in the car outside of Gatesville, Texas,
where I grew up in the early part of my life.
Outside of Gatesville we were coming back from the grocery store.
My mom was driving; my brother and I were in the back seat.
We were really mad at my mom. We looked out the window.
We were surrounded by thousands of acres of cotton fields.
You see, we'd just been to the grocery store,
and my mom refused to buy us the jar of Ovaltine
that had the coupon for the Captain Midnight decoder ring in it.
And, buddy, that made us mad.
Well, my mom didn't put up with much either, and she was driving, and she said,
"You boys! You think you can have anything you want.
You don't know how hard it is to earn money. Your dad works so hard.
You think money grows on trees. You've never worked a day in your lives.
You boys make me so mad. You're going to get a job this summer."
My brother and I stepped out of the car.
We were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton.
There were about a hundred black folks out there picking.
My mom grabbed us by the shoulders. She marched us out in the field.
She went up to the foreman; she said,
"I've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives."
Of course, we were just eight and 10.
(Laughter)
She said, "Would you put them to work?"
Well, that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman:
put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field
in August in Texas -- it's hot.
So he gave us each a cotton sack,
about 10 feet long, about that big around, and we started picking.
Now, cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers.
And if you don't know what you're doing,
your hands are bleeding in no time.
And my brother and I started to pick it,
and our hands were startin' to bleed, and then -- "Mom!"
And Mom was just sitting by the car like this.
She wasn't going to give up.
He kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice.
He just sang: "Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
Don't want it to leave me behind.
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
Don't want it to leave me behind."
And from all around as people started singing and answering back, he sang:
"Good news, good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me behind."
Now, my brother and I had never heard anything like that
in our whole lives. It was so beautiful.
We sat there all day picking cotton, without complaining,
without crying, while they sang things like:
"Oh, Mary, don't you weep, don't you moan" and "Wade in the water,"
and "I done done," "This little light of mine."
we'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton.
But the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar,
but my mother would never let us cash it.
I'm 57; still have the check.
Now, my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work.
But if you have children, you know it doesn't often work that way.
No, we learned something else.
The first thing I learned that day
was that I never ever wanted to work that hard again.
(Laughter)
And pretty much never did.
But I also learned that some people in this world
do have to work that hard every day, and that was an eye-opener.
And I also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier.
And it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can.
when my mama put me out of the car in that hot Texas cotton field.
I wasn't even aware of music -- not even aware of it.
But that day in the cotton field out there picking,
when those people started singing,
I realized I was in the very heart of real music,
and that's where I've wanted to be ever since.
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
Well, there's a long white robe in heaven, I know.
Don't want it to leave me behind.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me --
Let's try it one more time.
Don't want it to leave me behind.
There's a starry crown in heaven, I know.
Don't want it to leave me behind.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
and I told it at a concert.
My mom was in the audience.
After the -- she was glad to have a story about herself, of course,
but after the concert she came up and she said,
"David, I've got to tell you something.
I set that whole thing up.
I set it up with the foreman. I set it up with the owner of the land.
I just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work.
I didn't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though."
Good news: Chariot's coming.
Good news: Chariot's coming.
And I don't want it to leave me behind.
(Applause)
It was originally made by the Dopyera Brothers,
who later on made the Dobro, which is a wood-bodied instrument
with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from.
It's usually played flat on your lap.
It was made to play Hawaiian music back in the 1920s,
before they had electric guitars, trying to make a loud guitar.
And then African-American folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck,
just like that -- a nice Merlot works very well.
That wine we had yesterday would have been perfect.
Break it off, put it on your finger, and slide into the notes.
This instrument pretty much saved my life.
my wife and I lost our daughter, Sarah Jane, in a car accident,
and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world.
And I think I learned a lot about what happiness was
by going through such unbelievable grief,
just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in.
I had to make lists of reasons to stay alive.
I had to sit down and make lists, because I was ready to go;
I was ready to check out of this world.
And you know, at the top of the list, of course,
were Jenny, and my son, Zeb, my parents -- I didn't want to hurt them.
But then, when I thought about it beyond that,
it was very simple things.
I didn't care about -- I had a radio show,
I have a radio show on public radio, "Riverwalk,"
I didn't care about that. I didn't care about awards or money or anything.
Nothing. Nothing.
On the list it would be stuff like,
seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring, the smell of new-mown hay,
catching a wave and bodysurfing, the touch of a baby's hand,
the sound of Doc Watson playing the guitar,
listening to old records of Muddy Waters and Uncle Dave Macon.
And for me, the sound of a steel guitar,
because one of my parents' neighbors just gave me one of these things.
And I would sit around with it, and I didn't know how to play it,
but I would just play stuff as sad as I could play.
And it was the only instrument that, of all the ones that I play,
that would really make that connection.
This is a song that came out of that.
Well, I hear you're having trouble.
Lord, I hate to hear that news.
If you want to talk about it, you know, I will listen to you through.
I just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues.
Oh yeah, that's easier said than done.
While you can hardly move, they're running around having all kinds of fun.
'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues.
with drink and drugs and cigarettes,
but you know that's not going to get you where you want to get.
Call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues.
Open up now.
(Applause)
We moved to California when Sputnik went up, in 1957.
And he was working on gyroscopes;
he has a number of patents for that kind of thing.
And we moved across the street from Michael and John Whitney.
They were about my age.
John went on, and Michael did too,
to become some of the inventors of computer animation.
Michael's dad was working on something called the computer.
This was 1957, I was a little 10-year-old kid;
I didn't know what that was. But he took me down to see one,
you know, what they were making. It was like a library,
just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see,
just floors and floors of these things,
and one of the engineers said,
some day you're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket.
I thought, damn, those are going to be some big pants!
(Laughter)
that Christmas I got the Mister Wizard Fun-o-Rama chemistry set.
Well, I wanted to be an inventor just like my dad; so did Michael.
His great-granddad had been Eli Whitney,
the inventor of the cotton gin.
So we looked in that --
this was a commercial chemistry set.
It had three chemicals we were really surprised to see:
sulfur, potassium nitrate and charcoal.
Man, we were only 10, but we knew that made gunpowder.
We made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway
and we threw a match and phew, it flared up. Ah, it was great.
So we went over into Michael's garage --
his dad had all kinds of stuff, and we put a pipe in the vice there,
and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe,
drilled a hole in the back of the pipe, took some of our firecrackers,
pulled out the fuses, tied them together, put them in the back there,
and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder
down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top, in the garage.
(Laughter)
We weren't stupid: we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it.
We stood back, we lit that thing,
and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper.
Through the garage.
Two of them landed in the side door of his new Citroen.
(Laughter)
We tore everything down and buried it in his backyard.
That was Pacific Palisades; it probably is still there, back there.
He and his buddies, they were older, and they were pretty mean.
They said they were going to beat us up
if we didn't make some gunpowder for them.
We said, well, what are you going to do with it?
They said, we're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel.
(Laughter)
Sure. We'll make you a big batch.
(Laughter)
So we made them a big batch, and it was in my --
now, we'd just moved here. We'd just moved to California.
Mom had redone the kitchen; Mom was gone that day. We had a pie tin.
It became Chris Berquist's job to do the melting down.
Michael and I were standing way at the side of the kitchen.
He said, "Yeah, hey, it's melting. Yeah, the sulfur's melting.
No problem. Yeah, you know."
It just flared up, and he turned around, and he looked like this.
No hair, no eyelashes, no nothing.
There were big welts all over my mom's kitchen cabinet;
the air was the just full of black smoke.
She came home, she took that chemistry set away, and we never saw it again.
But we thought of it often, because every time she'd cook tuna surprise
it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder.
and I think I'll close out my set with something I invented a good while back.
When drum machines were new, I got to thinking,
why couldn't you take the oldest form of music, the hambone rhythms,
and combine it with the newest technology?
I call this Thunderwear.
At that time, drum triggers were new.
And so I put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit.
I showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday;
I'm going to be doing some of the same ones.
I have a trigger here, trigger here, here, here. Right there.
It's going to really hurt if I don't take that off. Okay.
Now, the drum triggers go out my tail here, into the drum machine,
and they can make various sounds, like drums.
So let me put them all together. And also, I can change the sounds
by stepping on this pedal right here, and --
let me just close out here by doing you a little
hambone solo or something like this.
(Applause)
We all make decisions every day; we want to know
what the right thing is to do -- in domains from the financial
to the gastronomic to the professional to the romantic.
And surely, if somebody could really tell us how to do
exactly the right thing at all possible times,
that would be a tremendous gift.
by a Dutch polymath named Daniel Bernoulli.
And what I want to talk to you about today is what that gift is,
and I also want to explain to you why it is
that it hasn't made a damn bit of difference.
And if it looks like Greek to you, it's because, well, it's Greek.
But the simple English translation -- much less precise,
but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this:
The expected value of any of our actions --
that is, the goodness that we can count on getting --
is the product of two simple things:
the odds that this action will allow us to gain something,
and the value of that gain to us.
if we can estimate and multiply these two things,
we will always know precisely how we should behave.
who don't like equations, is something that you're quite used to.
Here's an example: if I were to tell you, let's play
a little coin toss game, and I'm going to flip a coin,
and if it comes up heads, I'm going to pay you 10 dollars,
but you have to pay four dollars for the privilege of playing with me,
most of you would say, sure, I'll take that bet. Because you know
that the odds of you winning are one half, the gain if you do is 10 dollars,
that multiplies to five, and that's more
than I'm charging you to play. So, the answer is, yes.
This is what statisticians technically call a damn fine bet.
but in fact, it's not very simple in everyday life.
People are horrible at estimating both of these things,
and that's what I want to talk to you about today.
what the right thing is to do, and those are
errors in estimating the odds that they're going to succeed,
and errors in estimating the value of their own success.
Now, let me talk about the first one first.
Calculating odds would seem to be something rather easy:
there are six sides to a die, two sides to a coin, 52 cards in a deck.
You all know what the likelihood is of pulling the ace of spades
or of flipping a heads.
But as it turns out, this is not a very easy idea to apply
in everyday life. That's why Americans spend more --
I should say, lose more -- gambling
than on all other forms of entertainment combined.
The reason is, this isn't how people do odds.
requires that we first talk a bit about pigs.
Now, the question I'm going to put to you is whether you think
there are more dogs or pigs on leashes
observed in any particular day in Oxford.
And of course, you all know that the answer is dogs.
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is
you quickly reviewed in memory the times
you've seen dogs and pigs on leashes.
It was very easy to remember seeing dogs,
not so easy to remember pigs. And each one of you assumed
that if dogs on leashes came more quickly to your mind,
then dogs on leashes are more probable.
That's not a bad rule of thumb, except when it is.
Are there more four-letter English words
with R in the third place or R in the first place?
Well, you check memory very briefly, make a quick scan,
and it's awfully easy to say to yourself, Ring, Rang, Rung,
and very hard to say to yourself, Pare, Park: they come more slowly.
But in fact, there are many more words in the English language
with R in the third than the first place.
The reason words with R in the third place come slowly to your mind
isn't because they're improbable, unlikely or infrequent.
It's because the mind recalls words by their first letter.
You kind of shout out the sound, S -- and the word comes.
It's like the dictionary;
it's hard to look things up by the third letter.
So, this is an example of how this idea that
the quickness with which things come to mind
can give you a sense of their probability --
For example, when Americans are asked to estimate the odds
that they will die in a variety of interesting ways --
these are estimates of number of deaths per year
per 200 million U.S. citizens.
And these are just ordinary people like yourselves who are asked
to guess how many people die from tornado, fireworks, asthma, drowning, etc.
Compare these to the actual numbers.
two things are vastly over-estimated, namely tornadoes and fireworks.
Two things are vastly underestimated:
dying by drowning and dying by asthma. Why?
When was the last time that you picked up a newspaper
and the headline was, "Boy dies of Asthma?"
It's not interesting because it's so common.
It's very easy for all of us to bring to mind instances
of news stories or newsreels where we've seen
tornadoes devastating cities, or some poor schmuck
who's blown his hands off with a firework on the Fourth of July.
Drownings and asthma deaths don't get much coverage.
They don't come quickly to mind, and as a result,
we vastly underestimate them.
of "Which thing doesn't belong?" And you're right to say
it's the swimming pool that doesn't belong, because the swimming pool
is the only thing on this slide that's actually very dangerous.
The way that more of you are likely to die than the combination
of all three of the others that you see on the slide.
of people's ability to compute probabilities.
And economists -- forgive me, for those of you who play the lottery --
but economists, at least among themselves, refer to the lottery
as a stupidity tax, because the odds of getting any payoff
by investing your money in a lottery ticket
are approximately equivalent to flushing the money
directly down the toilet -- which, by the way,
doesn't require that you actually go to the store and buy anything.
Well, there are many answers, but one answer surely is,
we see a lot of winners. Right? When this couple wins the lottery,
or Ed McMahon shows up at your door with this giant check --
how the hell do you cash things that size, I don't know.
We see this on TV; we read about it in the paper.
When was the last time that you saw extensive interviews
with everybody who lost?
Indeed, if we required that television stations run
a 30-second interview with each loser
every time they interview a winner, the 100 million losers
in the last lottery would require nine-and-a-half years
of your undivided attention just to watch them say,
"Me? I lost." "Me? I lost."
Now, if you watch nine-and-a-half years of television --
no sleep, no potty breaks -- and you saw loss after loss after loss,
and then at the end there's 30 seconds of, "and I won,"
the likelihood that you would play the lottery is very small.
There's 10 tickets in this lottery.
Nine of them have been sold to these individuals.
It costs you a dollar to buy the ticket and, if you win,
you get 20 bucks. Is this a good bet?
Well, Bernoulli tells us it is.
The expected value of this lottery is two dollars;
this is a lottery in which you should invest your money.
And most people say, "OK, I'll play."
imagine that the nine tickets are all owned
by one fat guy named Leroy.
Leroy has nine tickets; there's one left.
Do you want it? Most people won't play this lottery.
Now, you can see the odds of winning haven't changed,
but it's now fantastically easy to imagine who's going to win.
It's easy to see Leroy getting the check, right?
You can't say to yourself, "I'm as likely to win as anybody,"
because you're not as likely to win as Leroy.
The fact that all those tickets are owned by one guy
changes your decision to play,
even though it does nothing whatsoever to the odds.
compared to trying to estimate value:
trying to say what something is worth, how much we'll enjoy it,
how much pleasure it will give us.
I want to talk now about errors in value.
How much is this Big Mac worth? Is it worth 25 dollars?
Most of you have the intuition that it's not --
you wouldn't pay that for it.
that you ask one, and only one question, which is:
What else can I do with 25 dollars?
If you've ever gotten on one of those long-haul flights to Australia
and realized that they're not going to serve you any food,
but somebody in the row in front of you has just opened
the McDonald's bag, and the smell of golden arches
is wafting over the seat, you think,
I can't do anything else with this 25 dollars for 16 hours.
I can't even set it on fire -- they took my cigarette lighter!
Suddenly, 25 dollars for a Big Mac might be a good deal.
and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal, it's exorbitant for a Big Mac.
Why were you all sure that the answer to the question was no,
before I'd even told you anything about the context?
Because most of you compared the price of this Big Mac
to the price you're used to paying. Rather than asking,
"What else can I do with my money," comparing this investment
to other possible investments, you compared to the past.
And this is a systematic error people make.
What you knew is, you paid three dollars in the past; 25 is outrageous.
the kinds of irrationalities to which it leads.
For example, this is, of course,
one of the most delicious tricks in marketing,
is to say something used to be higher,
and suddenly it seems like a very good deal.
When people are asked about these two different jobs:
a job where you make 60K, then 50K, then 40K,
a job where you're getting a salary cut each year,
and one in which you're getting a salary increase,
people like the second job better than the first, despite the fact
they're all told they make much less money. Why?
Because they had the sense that declining wages are worse
than rising wages, even when the total amount of wages is higher
in the declining period. Here's another nice example.
Assuming you wanted to go to Hawaii, would you buy this package?
Most people say they would. Here's a slightly different story:
$2,000 Hawaiian vacation package is now on sale for 700 dollars,
so you decide to mull it over for a week.
By the time you get to the ticket agency, the best fares are gone --
the package now costs 1,500. Would you buy it? Most people say, no.
Why? Because it used to cost 700, and there's no way I'm paying 1,500
for something that was 700 last week.
is causing people to pass up the better deal. In other words,
a good deal that used to be a great deal is not nearly as good
as an awful deal that was once a horrible deal.
can befuddle our decisions.
Imagine that you're going to the theater.
You're on your way to the theater.
In your wallet you have a ticket, for which you paid 20 dollars.
You also have a 20-dollar bill.
When you arrive at the theater,
you discover that somewhere along the way you've lost the ticket.
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it?
Most people answer, no.
Now, let's just change one thing in this scenario.
You're on your way to the theater,
and in your wallet you have two 20-dollar bills.
When you arrive you discover you've lost one of them.
Would you spend your remaining 20 dollars on a ticket?
Well, of course, I went to the theater to see the play.
What does the loss of 20 dollars along the way have to do?
here's a schematic of what happened, OK?
(Laughter)
Along the way, you lost something.
In both cases, it was a piece of paper.
In one case, it had a U.S. president on it; in the other case it didn't.
What the hell difference should it make?
The difference is that when you lost the ticket you say to yourself,
I'm not paying twice for the same thing.
You compare the cost of the play now -- 40 dollars --
to the cost that it used to have -- 20 dollars -- and you say it's a bad deal.
Comparing with the past causes many of the problems
that behavioral economists and psychologists identify
in people's attempts to assign value.
But even when we compare with the possible, instead of the past,
we still make certain kinds of mistakes.
And I'm going to show you one or two of them.
that when we compare one thing to the other, it changes its value.
So in 1992, this fellow, George Bush, for those of us who were
kind of on the liberal side of the political spectrum,
didn't seem like such a great guy.
Suddenly, we're almost longing for him to return.
(Laughter)
The comparison changes how we evaluate him.
and they use this wisdom to help you --
spare you the undue burden of money.
And so a retailer, if you were to go into a wine shop
and you had to buy a bottle of wine,
and you see them here for eight, 27 and 33 dollars, what would you do?
Most people don't want the most expensive,
they don't want the least expensive.
So, they will opt for the item in the middle.
If you're a smart retailer, then, you will put a very expensive item
that nobody will ever buy on the shelf,
because suddenly the $33 wine doesn't look as expensive in comparison.
namely, that comparison changes the value of things.
Here's why that's a problem:
the problem is that when you get that $33 bottle of wine home,
it won't matter what it used to be sitting on the shelf next to.
The comparisons we make when we are appraising value,
where we're trying to estimate how much we'll like things,
are not the same comparisons we'll be making when we consume them.
This problem of shifting comparisons can bedevil
our attempts to make rational decisions.
I have to show you something from my own lab, so let me sneak this in.
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked
the simplest of all questions:
How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now?
They're sitting in a room with potato chips in front of them.
For some of the subjects, sitting in the far corner of a room
is a box of Godiva chocolates, and for others is a can of Spam.
In fact, these items that are sitting in the room change
how much the subjects think they're going to enjoy the potato chips.
Namely, those who are looking at Spam
think potato chips are going to be quite tasty;
those who are looking at Godiva chocolate
think they won't be nearly so tasty.
Of course, what happens when they eat the potato chips?
Well, look, you didn't need a psychologist to tell you that
when you have a mouthful of greasy, salty, crispy, delicious snacks,
what's sitting in the corner of the room
makes not a damn bit of difference to your gustatory experience.
Nonetheless, their predictions are perverted by a comparison
that then does not carry through and change their experience.
into our lab to eat potato chips. So here's a question:
You want to buy a car stereo.
The dealer near your house sells this particular stereo for 200 dollars,
but if you drive across town, you can get it for 100 bucks.
So would you drive to get 50 percent off, saving 100 dollars?
Most people say they would.
They can't imagine buying it for twice the price
when, with one trip across town, they can get it for half off.
and the dealer near your house had it for 31,000.
But if you drove across town, you could get it for 30,900.
Would you drive to get it? At this point, 0.003 savings -- the 100 dollars.
Most people say, no, I'm going to schlep across town
to save 100 bucks on the purchase of a car?
Because this 100 dollars that you save -- hello! --
doesn't know where it came from.
It doesn't know what you saved it on.
When you go to buy groceries with it, it doesn't go,
I'm the money saved on the car stereo, or,
I'm the dumb money saved on the car. It's money.
And if a drive across town is worth 100 bucks, it's worth 100 bucks
no matter what you're saving it on. People don't think that way.
That's why they don't know whether their mutual fund manager
is taking 0.1 percent or 0.15 percent of their investment,
but they clip coupons to save one dollar off of toothpaste.
because what you're doing is, you're comparing the 100 bucks
to the purchase that you're making,
but when you go to spend that money you won't be making that comparison.
You've all had this experience.
And at some point you may have met a couple
from your own hometown, and you thought,
"Oh, my God, these people are so warm. They're so nice to me.
I mean, compared to all these people who hate me
when I try to speak their language and hate me more when I don't,
these people are just wonderful." And so you tour France with them,
and then you get home and you invite them over for dinner,
and what do you find?
Compared to your regular friends,
they are boring and dull, right? Because in this new context,
the comparison is very, very different. In fact, you find yourself
disliking them enough almost to qualify for French citizenship.
You go to the stereo store, you see two sets of speakers --
these big, boxy, monoliths, and these little, sleek speakers,
and you play them, and you go, you know, I do hear a difference:
the big ones sound a little better.
And so you buy them, and you bring them home,
and you entirely violate the décor of your house.
And the problem, of course, is that this comparison you made in the store
is a comparison you'll never make again.
What are the odds that years later you'll turn on the stereo and go,
"Sounds so much better than those little ones,"
which you can't even remember hearing.
when these choices are arrayed over time.
People have a lot of trouble making decisions
about things that will happen at different points in time.
And what psychologists and behavioral economists have discovered
is that by and large people use two simple rules.
So let me give you one very easy problem, a second very easy problem
and then a third, hard, problem.
You can have 60 dollars now or 50 dollars now. Which would you prefer?
This is what we call a one-item IQ test, OK?
All of us, I hope, prefer more money, and the reason is,
we believe more is better than less.
You can have 60 dollars today or 60 dollars in a month. Which would you prefer?
Again, an easy decision,
because we all know that now is better than later.
What's hard in our decision-making is when these two rules conflict.
For example, when you're offered 50 dollars now or 60 dollars in a month.
This typifies a lot of situations in life in which you will gain
by waiting, but you have to be patient.
What do we know? What do people do in these kinds of situations?
Well, by and large people are enormously impatient.
That is, they require interest rates in the hundred
or thousands of percents in order to delay gratification
and wait until next month for the extra 10 dollars.
Maybe that isn't so remarkable, but what is remarkable is
how easy it is to make this impatience go away by simply changing
when the delivery of these monetary units will happen.
Imagine that you can have 50 dollars in a year -- that's 12 months --
or 60 dollars in 13 months.
What do we find now?
People are gladly willing to wait: as long as they're waiting 12,
they might as well wait 13.
Comparison. Troubling comparison. Let me show you.
you would show if I gave you time to respond, which is,
people find that the subjective value of 50 is higher
than the subjective value of 60 when they'll be delivered in now
or one month, respectively -- a 30-day delay --
but they show the reverse pattern when you push the entire decision
off into the future a year.
Now, why in the world do you get this pattern of results?
What you see here are two lads,
one of them larger than the other: the fireman and the fiddler.
They are going to recede towards the vanishing point in the horizon,
and I want you to notice two things.
At no point will the fireman look taller than the fiddler. No point.
However, the difference between them seems to be getting smaller.
First it's an inch in your view, then it's a quarter-inch,
then a half-inch, and then finally they go off the edge of the earth.
This is the subjective height --
the height you saw of these guys at various points.
And I want you to see that two things are true.
One, the farther away they are, the smaller they look;
and two, the fireman is always bigger than the fiddler.
But watch what happens when we make some of them disappear. Right.
At a very close distance, the fiddler looks taller than the fireman,
but at a far distance
their normal, their true, relations are preserved.
As Plato said, what space is to size, time is to value.
These are the results of the hard problem I gave you:
60 now or 50 in a month?
And these are subjective values,
and what you can see is, our two rules are preserved.
60 is always better than 50,
and they always think now is better than later:
the bars on this side are higher than the bars on this side.
Watch what happens when we drop some out.
Suddenly we have the dynamic inconsistency that puzzled us.
We have the tendency for people to go for 50 dollars now
over waiting a month, but not if that decision is far in the future.
Notice something interesting that this implies -- namely, that
when people get to the future, they will change their minds.
That is, as that month 12 approaches, you will say,
what was I thinking, waiting an extra month for 60 dollars?
I'll take the 50 dollars now.
If we're so damn stupid, how did we get to the moon?
Because I could go on for about two hours with evidence
of people's inability to estimate odds and inability to estimate value.
in some of the talks, and I dare say you will hear again:
namely, that our brains were evolved for a very different world
than the one in which we are living.
They were evolved for a world
in which people lived in very small groups,
rarely met anybody who was terribly different from themselves,
had rather short lives in which there were few choices
and the highest priority was to eat and mate today.
how we should think in a world for which nature never designed us.
That explains why we are so bad at using it, but it also explains
why it is so terribly important that we become good, fast.
We are the only species on this planet
that has ever held its own fate in its hands.
We have no significant predators,
we're the masters of our physical environment;
the things that normally cause species to become extinct
are no longer any threat to us.
The only thing -- the only thing -- that can destroy us and doom us
are our own decisions.
If we're not here in 10,000 years, it's going to be because
we could not take advantage of the gift given to us
by a young Dutch fellow in 1738,
because we underestimated the odds of our future pains
and overestimated the value of our present pleasures.
(Applause)
We have time for some questions for Dan Gilbert. One and two.
is in part how terrorism actually works to frighten us,
and is there some way that we could counteract that?
with the Department of Homeland Security, which generally believes
that American security dollars should go to making borders safer.
I tried to point out to them that terrorism was a name
based on people's psychological reaction to a set of events,
and that if they were concerned about terrorism they might ask
what causes terror and how can we stop people from being terrified,
rather than -- not rather than, but in addition to
stopping the atrocities that we're all concerned about.
Surely the kinds of play that at least American media give to --
and forgive me, but in raw numbers these are very tiny accidents.
We already know, for example, in the United States,
more people have died as a result of not taking airplanes --
because they were scared -- and driving on highways,
than were killed in 9/11. OK?
If I told you that there was a plague
that was going to kill 15,000 Americans next year,
you might be alarmed if you didn't find out it was the flu.
These are small-scale accidents, and we should be wondering
whether they should get the kind of play,
the kind of coverage, that they do.
Surely that causes people to overestimate the likelihood
that they'll be hurt in these various ways,
and gives power to the very people who want to frighten us.
that our response to terror is, I mean, it's a form of mental bug?
Talk more about it.
If Australia disappears tomorrow,
terror is probably the right response.
That's an awful large lot of very nice people. On the other hand,
when a bus blows up and 30 people are killed,
more people than that were killed
by not using their seatbelts in the same country.
Is terror the right response?
that it's so spectacular?
Is it the fact that it's an intentional attack by, quote, outsiders?
What is it?
First, it's a human agent trying to kill us --
it's not a tree falling on us by accident.
Second, these are enemies who may want to strike and hurt us again.
People are being killed for no reason instead of good reason --
as if there's good reason, but sometimes people think there are.
So there are a number of things that together
make this seem like a fantastic event, but let's not play down
the fact that newspapers sell when people see something in it
they want to read. So there's a large role here played by the media,
who want these things to be
as spectacular as they possibly can.
go to Israel. And a mall blows up,
and then everybody's unhappy about it, and an hour-and-a-half later --
at least when I was there, and I was 150 feet from the mall
when it blew up -- I went back to my hotel
and the wedding that was planned was still going on.
And as the Israeli mother said,
she said, "We never let them win by stopping weddings."
I mean, this is a society that has learned --
and there are others too -- that has learned to live
with a certain amount of terrorism and not be quite as upset by it,
shall I say, as those of us who have not had many terror attacks.
the reason we're frightened about this is because we think that
the Big One is to come?
there would ever be, there might be more and more buses of 30 people --
we would probably not be nearly so frightened.
I don't want to say -- please, I'm going to get quoted somewhere
as saying, "Terrorism is fine and we shouldn't be so distressed."
That's not my point at all.
What I'm saying is that, surely, rationally,
our distress about things that happen, about threats,
should be roughly proportional to the size of those threats
and threats to come.
I think in the case of terrorism, it isn't.
And many of the things we've heard about from our speakers today --
how many people do you know got up and said,
Poverty! I can't believe what poverty is doing to us.
People get up in the morning; they don't care about poverty.
It's not making headlines, it's not making news, it's not flashy.
There are no guns going off.
I mean, if you had to solve one of these problems, Chris,
which would you solve? Terrorism or poverty?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That's a tough one.
Poverty, by an order of magnitude, a huge order of magnitude,
unless someone can show that there's, you know,
terrorists with a nuke are really likely to come.
The latest I've read, seen, thought
is that it's incredibly hard for them to do that.
If that turns out to be wrong, we all look silly,
but with poverty it's a bit --
about these dramatic attacks. Is that because in the past,
in the ancient past, we just didn't understand things like disease
and systems that cause poverty and so forth,
and so it made no sense for us as a species to put any energy
into worrying about those things?
People died; so be it.
But if you got attacked, that was something you could do something about.
And so we evolved these responses.
Is that what happened?
about leaping to evolutionary explanations for everything
are the evolutionary psychologists themselves.
My guess is that there's nothing quite that specific
in our evolutionary past. But rather, if you're looking for
an evolutionary explanation, you might say
that most organisms are neo-phobic -- that is, they're a little scared
of stuff that's new and different.
And there's a good reason to be,
because old stuff didn't eat you. Right?
Any animal you see that you've seen before is less likely
to be a predator than one that you've never seen before.
So, you know, when a school bus is blown up and we've never seen this before,
our general tendency is to orient towards
that which is new and novel is activated.
I don't think it's quite as specific a mechanism
as the one you alluded to, but maybe a more fundamental one underlying it.
the stupidity of people who buy lottery tickets. But I suspect
you're making the exact same error you're accusing those people of,
which is the error of value.
I know, because I've interviewed
about 1,000 lottery buyers over the years.
It turns out that the value of buying a lottery ticket is not winning.
That's what you think it is. All right?
The average lottery buyer buys about 150 tickets a year,
so the buyer knows full well that he or she is going to lose,
and yet she buys 150 tickets a year. Why is that?
It's not because she is stupid or he is stupid.
It's because the anticipation of possibly winning
releases serotonin in the brain, and actually provides a good feeling
until the drawing indicates you've lost.
Or, to put it another way, for the dollar investment,
you can have a much better feeling than flushing the money
down the toilet, which you cannot have a good feeling from.
Now, economists tend to --
(Applause)
-- economists tend to view the world
through their own lenses, which is:
this is just a bunch of stupid people.
And as a result, many people look at economists as stupid people.
And so fundamentally, the reason we got to the moon is,
we didn't listen to the economists. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
whether the joy of anticipation is exactly equaled
by the amount of disappointment after the lottery. Because remember,
people who didn't buy tickets don't feel awful the next day either,
even though they don't feel great during the drawing.
I would disagree that people know they're not going to win.
I think they think it's unlikely, but it could happen,
which is why they prefer that to the flushing.
But certainly I see your point: that there can be
some utility to buying a lottery ticket other than winning.
Now, I think there's many good reasons not to listen to economists.
That isn't one of them, for me, but there's many others.
I work on the thing that kills more people than anything else kills --
I work on aging -- and I'm interested in doing something about it,
as we'll all hear tomorrow.
I very much resonate with what you're saying,
because it seems to me that the problem
with getting people interested in doing anything about aging
is that by the time aging is about to kill you it looks like cancer
or heart disease or whatever. Do you have any advice?
(Laughter)
Well, it's notoriously difficult to get people to be farsighted.
But one thing that psychologists have tried that seems to work
is to get people to imagine the future more vividly.
One of the problems with making decisions about the far future
and the near future is that we imagine the near future
much more vividly than the far future.
To the extent that you can equalize the amount of detail
that people put into the mental representations
of near and far future, people begin to make decisions
about the two in the same way.
So, would you like to have an extra 100,000 dollars when you're 65
is a question that's very different than,
imagine who you'll be when you're 65: will you be living,
what will you look like, how much hair will you have,
who will you be living with.
Once we have all the details of that imaginary scenario,
suddenly we feel like it might be important to save
so that that guy has a little retirement money.
But these are tricks around the margins.
I think in general you're battling a very fundamental human tendency,
which is to say, "I'm here today,
and so now is more important than later."
that was a fantastic session. Thank you.
(Applause)
It's wonderful to be back.
I love this wonderful gathering.
And you must be wondering, "What on earth?
Have they put up the wrong slide?"
No, no.
Look at this magnificent beast,
and ask the question: Who designed it?
and there's a dairy cow.
It's a quite wonderfully designed animal.
And I was thinking, how do I introduce this?
And I thought, well, maybe that old doggerel by Joyce Kilmer,
This is the ancestor of cattle.
This is the aurochs.
And it was designed by natural selection,
the process of natural selection, over many millions of years.
And then it became domesticated, thousands of years ago.
And human beings became its stewards,
and, without even knowing what they were doing,
they gradually redesigned it and redesigned it and redesigned it.
And then more recently, they really began to do reverse engineering on this beast
and figure out just what the parts were, how they worked
and how they might be optimized -- how they might be made better.
Because I want to say that much the same thing is true of religions.
Religions are natural phenomena -- they're just as natural as cows.
They have evolved over millennia.
They have a biological base, just like the aurochs.
They have become domesticated,
and human beings have been redesigning their religions for thousands of years.
This is TED, and I want to talk about design.
Because what I've been doing for the last four years --
really since the first time you saw me --
some of you saw me at TED when I was talking about religion --
and in the last four years,
I've been working just about non-stop on this topic.
And you might say it's about the reverse engineering of religions.
Now that very idea, I think, strikes terror in many people,
or anger, or anxiety of one sort or another.
And that is the spell that I want to break.
We should study them with the same intensity
that we study all the other important natural phenomena,
like global warming, as we heard so eloquently last night from Al Gore.
Today's religions are brilliantly designed -- brilliantly designed.
They are immensely powerful social institutions
that we can really make sense of by reverse engineering.
And, as with the cow, there's a mixture of evolutionary design --
designed by natural selection itself --
and intelligent design --
more or less intelligent design --
and redesigned by human beings
who are trying to redesign their religions.
but I'm going to have just one slide about my book,
because there is one message in it
which I think this group really needs to hear.
at this time, when I claim not to know enough about religion
I'm going to just take a couple of minutes to explain it:
in primary school, in high school,
So what I'm proposing is,
just as we require reading, writing, arithmetic, American history,
so we should have a curriculum on facts about all the religions of the world --
about their history, about their creeds, about their texts,
their music, their symbolisms, their prohibitions, their requirements.
And this should be presented factually, straightforwardly,
with no particular spin, to all of the children in the country.
And as long as you teach them that,
you can teach them anything else you like.
That, I think, is maximal tolerance for religious freedom.
As long as you inform your children about other religions,
then you may -- and as early as you like and whatever you like --
teach them whatever creed you want them to learn.
But also let them know about other religions.
Because democracy depends on an informed citizenship.
Informed consent is the very bedrock of our understanding of democracy.
Misinformed consent is not worth it.
It's like a coin flip; it doesn't count, really.
Democracy depends on informed consent.
This is the way we treat people as responsible adults.
Now, children below the age of consent are a special case.
Parents -- I'm going to use a word that Pastor Rick just used --
parents are stewards of their children.
They don't own them.
You can't own your children.
You have a responsibility to the world,
to the state, to them, to take care of them right.
You may teach them whatever creed you think is most important,
but I say you have a responsibility to let them be informed
about all the other creeds in the world, too.
One reviewer for a Roman Catholic newspaper called it "totalitarian."
It strikes me as practically libertarian.
Is it totalitarian to require reading, writing and arithmetic?
I don't think so.
All I'm saying is --
and facts, facts only; no values, just facts --
about all the world's religions.
Another reviewer called it "hilarious."
Well, I'm really bothered by the fact
that anybody would think that was hilarious.
It seems to me to be such a plausible,
natural extension of the democratic principles we already have
that I'm shocked to think anybody would find that just ridiculous.
I know many religions
are so anxious about preserving the purity of their faith among their children
that they are intent on keeping their children ignorant of other faiths.
I don't think that's defensible.
But I'd really be pleased to get your answers on that --
any reactions to that -- later.
Back to the cow.
This picture, which I pulled off the web --
the fellow on the left is really an important part of this picture.
That's the steward.
Cows couldn't live without human stewards -- they're domesticated.
They're a sort of ectosymbiont.
They depend on us for their survival.
And Pastor Rick was just talking about sheep.
I'm going to talk about sheep, too.
There's a lot of serendipitous convergence here.
How clever it was of sheep to acquire shepherds!
They could outsource all their problems:
protection from predators, food-finding ...
What a deal!
We all know sheep are not exactly rocket scientists -- they're not very smart.
It wasn't the cleverness of the sheep at all.
They were clueless.
But it was a very clever move.
Whose clever move was it?
It was the clever move of natural selection itself.
with Jim Watson,
once joked about what he called Orgel's Second Rule.
Leslie Orgel is a molecular biologist, brilliant guy,
and Orgel's Second Rule is:
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
Now, that is not Intelligent Design -- not from Francis Crick.
Evolution is cleverer than you are.
If you understand Orgel's Second Rule, then you understand
why the Intelligent Design movement is basically a hoax.
are brilliant, unbelievably brilliant.
Again and again biologists are fascinated with the brilliance of what's discovered.
But the process itself is without purpose,
without foresight, without design.
When I was here four years ago,
I told the story about an ant climbing a blade of grass.
And why the ant was doing it was because its brain had been infected
with a lancet fluke that was needed to get into the belly of a sheep or a cow
in order to reproduce.
So it was sort of a spooky story.
Lancet flukes aren't smart.
I submit that the intelligence of a lancet fluke is down there,
somewhere between petunia and carrot.
They're not really bright. They don't have to be.
The lesson we learn from this is:
you don't have to have a mind to be a beneficiary.
The design is there in nature, but it's not in anybody's head.
It doesn't have to be.
That's the way evolution works.
Question: Was domestication good for sheep?
It was great for their genetic fitness.
that Paul MacCready made at TED three years ago.
Here's what he said:
"Ten thousand years ago, at the dawn of agriculture,
human population, plus livestock and pets,
was approximately a tenth of one percent of the terrestrial vertebrate landmass."
That was just 10,000 years ago.
Yesterday, in biological terms.
What is it today? Does anybody remember what he told us?
98 percent.
That is what we have done on this planet.
how he'd calculated this, and get the sources and so forth --
and he also gave me a paper that he had written on this.
And there was a passage in it which he did not present here
and I think it is so good, I'm going to read it to you:
"Over billions of years on a unique sphere,
chance has painted a thin covering of life:
complex, improbable, wonderful and fragile.
Suddenly, we humans -- a recently arrived species
no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature --
have grown in population, technology and intelligence
to a position of terrible power.
We now wield the paintbrush."
We heard about the atmosphere as a thin layer of varnish.
Life itself is just a thin coat of paint on this planet.
And we're the ones that hold the paintbrush.
And how can we do that?
And the key to culture is religion.
Suppose Martian scientists came to Earth.
They would be puzzled by many things.
Anybody know what this is? I'll tell you what it is.
This is a million people gathering on the banks of the Ganges in 2001,
perhaps the largest single gathering of human beings ever,
as seen from satellite photograph.
Here's a big crowd.
Here's another crowd in Mecca.
Martians would be amazed by this.
They'd want to know how it originated,
what it was for and how it perpetuates itself.
The ant isn't alone.
There's all sorts of wonderful cases of species which -- in that case --
A parasite gets into a mouse and needs to get into the belly of a cat.
And it turns the mouse into Mighty Mouse, makes it fearless,
so it runs out in the open, where it'll be eaten by a cat.
True story.
In other words, we have these hijackers --
you've seen this slide before, from four years ago --
a parasite that infects the brain and induces even suicidal behavior,
on behalf of a cause other than one's own genetic fitness.
Yes, it does -- quite wonderfully.
The Arabic word "Islam" means "submission."
It means "surrender of self-interest to the will of Allah."
But I'm not just talking about Islam.
I'm talking also about Christianity.
This is a parchment music page that I found in a Paris bookstall
50 years ago.
And on it, it says, in Latin:
"Semen est verbum Dei. Sator autem Christus."
The word of God is the seed and the sower of the seed is Christ.
Same idea. Well, not quite.
But in fact, Christians, too ...
glory in the fact that they have surrendered to God.
I'll give you a few quotes.
"The heart of worship is surrender.
Surrendered people obey God's words, even if it doesn't make sense."
Those words are by Rick Warren.
Those are from "The Purpose Driven Life."
You've all got a copy,
and you've just heard the man.
And what I want to do now is say a bit about this book
from the design standpoint,
because I think it's actually a brilliant book.
First of all, the goal -- and you heard just now what the goal is --
it's to bring purpose to the lives of millions, and he has succeeded.
Is it a good goal? In itself, I'm sure we all agree, it is a wonderful goal.
He's absolutely right.
There are lots of people out there who don't have purpose in their life,
and bringing purpose to their life is a wonderful goal.
I give him an A+ on this.
Yes.
Thirty million copies of this book.
Al Gore, eat your heart out.
This is a fantastic achievement.
And the means -- how does he do it?
updating them, quietly dropping obsolete features,
This is the evolution of religion that's been going on for thousands of years,
and he's just the latest brilliant practitioner of it.
Excellent insights into human psychology, wise advice on every page.
Moreover, he invites us to look under the hood.
I really appreciated that.
For instance, he has an appendix where he explains
his choice of translations of different Bible verses.
The book is clear, vivid, accessible, beautifully formatted.
Just enough repetition.
That's really important.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
Every time you read it or say it, you make another copy in your brain.
you make another copy in your brain.
Because I'm absolutely sincere in my appreciation
of all that I said about this book.
But I wish it were better.
I have some problems with the book.
And it would just be insincere of me not to address those problems.
I wish he could do this with a revision,
a Mark 2 version of his book.
"The truth will set you free."
That's what it says in the Bible,
and it's something that I want to live by, too.
Now some of this is a difference of opinion.
And that's not my main complaint, that's worth mentioning.
Here's a passage -- it's very much what he said, anyway:
"If there was no God we would all be accidents,
the result of astronomical random chance in the Universe.
You could stop reading this book because life would have no purpose
or meaning or significance.
There would be no right or wrong
and no hope beyond your brief years on Earth."
Now, I just do not believe that.
By the way, I find -- Homer Groening's film presented a beautiful alternative
to that very claim.
Yes, there is meaning and a reason for right or wrong.
We don't need a belief in God to be good or to have meaning in us.
But that, as I said, is just a difference of opinion.
That's not what I'm really worried about.
just so we could live in it."
I'm afraid that a lot of people take that sentiment to mean
that we don't have to do the sorts of things
that Al Gore is trying so hard to get us to do.
I am not happy with that sentiment at all.
And then I find this: "All the evidence available in the biological sciences
supports the core proposition that the cosmos is a specially designed whole
a whole in which all facets of reality have their meaning
and explanation in this central fact."
Well, that's Michael Denton. He's a creationist.
And here, I think, "Wait a minute." I read this again.
I read it three or four times and I think,
"Is he really endorsing Intelligent Design?
Is he endorsing creationism here?"
And you can't tell.
So I'm sort of thinking, "Well, I don't know,
I don't know if I want to get upset with this yet."
because prior to the Flood, God irrigated the earth from the ground up."
I wish that sentence weren't in there, because I think it is false.
And I think that thinking this way about the history of the planet,
after we've just been hearing about the history of the planet
over millions of years,
discourages people from scientific understanding.
Now, Rick Warren uses scientific terms
and scientific factoids and information in a very interesting way.
in a way that makes your ministry unique.
He carefully mixed the DNA cocktail that created you."
I think that's false.
Now, maybe we want to treat it as metaphorical.
Here's another one: "For instance, your brain can store 100 trillion facts.
Your mind can handle 15,000 decisions a second."
Well, it would be interesting to find the interpretation
where I would accept that.
There might be some way of treating that as true.
"Anthropologists have noted that worship is a universal urge,
hardwired by God into the very fiber of our being --
an inbuilt need to connect with God."
is that he seems to be arguing that if you want to be moral,
if you want to have meaning in your life,
you have to be an Intelligent Designer,
you have to deny the theory of evolution by natural selection.
And I think, on the contrary,
that it is very important to solving the world's problems
that we take evolutionary biology seriously.
Whose truth are we going to listen to?
Well, this is from "The Purpose Driven Life":
"The Bible must become the authoritative standard for my life:
the compass I rely on for direction,
the counsel I listen to for making wise decisions,
and the benchmark I use for evaluating everything."
Well maybe, OK, but what's going to follow from this?
Remember I quoted him before with this line:
"Surrendered people obey God's word, even if it doesn't make sense."
And that's a problem.
He's better at arguing than you are,
having had thousands of years to practice."
Now, Rick Warren didn't invent this clever move.
It's an old move.
It's a very clever adaptation of religions.
It's a wild card for disarming any reasonable criticism.
You've got a reasonable objection to it?
Don't listen, don't listen!
That's the Devil speaking."
This discourages the sort of reasoning citizenship
it seems to me that we want to have.
And I'd really like to get a response if Rick is able to do it.
"In the Great Commission, Jesus said,
'Go to all people of all nations and make them my disciples.
Baptize them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit,
and teach them to do everything I've told you.'"
The Bible says Jesus is the only one who can save the world.
We've seen many wonderful maps of the world in the last day or so.
Here's one, not as beautiful as the others;
it simply shows the religions of the world.
Here's one that shows the sort of current breakdown of the different religions.
to engulfing all the other religions,
when their holy books are telling them,
"Don't listen to the other side, that's just Satan talking!"?
It seems to me that that's a very problematic ship
to get on for the future.
I found this sign as I was driving to Maine recently,
in front of a church: "Good without God becomes zero."
Sort of cute.
A very clever little meme.
I don't believe it and I think this idea, popular as it is --
not in this guise, but in general --
is itself one of the main problems that we face.
atheists, agnostics, who are being very good without God.
And you also know many religious people who hide behind their sanctity
instead of doing good works.
So, I wish we could drop this meme.
I wish this meme would go extinct.
I'm delighted to be here.
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in
won't interest many other people.
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.
I would love to talk about my astronomy,
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer
in non-gray atmospheres
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.
So I'm not going to talk about that.
(Laughter)
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.
And I caught the guys,
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,
and stealing information and selling it.
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --
but, 20 years later ...
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.
It's tedious.
I'm --
The second time, it's engineering.
A third time, it's just being a technician.
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.
So, I'm not going to talk about that.
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,
nor am I going to talk about
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.
that we have to bring more computers into schools.
My idea is: no! No!
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.
And I'd love to talk about this,
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom
that it doesn't need much talking about --
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,
and everything else that I've said.
So don't go back and read my dissertation.
It probably has lies in it as well.
(Laughter)
And if you look at it over here,
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,
because I've got gray hair,
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,
if you really want to know about the future,
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.
ask a kindergarten teacher.
They know.
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,
ask an experienced one.
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.
I don't. Nor, I suspect,
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things
that are going to be there.
But to me, things aren't the future.
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,
but have never gone bowling together?
is not one that is in software.
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about
is right over here. Right over here.
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.
I would dearly love to talk about
things that have one side.
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,
but I'm one of the very few people,
if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.
This is a Klein bottle.
For those of you in the audience who know,
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.
It has wonderful properties.
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.
And I'd love to talk to you about this,
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --
(Laughter)
Just two weeks ago I made --
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.
But what I've just made --
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,
which, although in four dimensions
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,
it's perfectly capable of doing so
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,
it can hold fluids.
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.
That was a month of my life.
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.
(Laughter)
who passed away last summer.
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.
Could somebody put this guy up?
And I looked over her album
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --
well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!
As a technician, repairing and maintaining
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!
And it sent me back.
This guy over here of course is me.
This man is Robert Moog,
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,
who passed away this past August.
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."
Mentoring me. He'd come up and
spend hours and hours with me.
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.
In the background, my bicycle.
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,
stuff like this.
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.
(Applause)
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.
I've decided that, for me at least,
I don't have a big enough head.
So I think locally and I act locally.
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.
I was talking about this stuff to
some schoolteachers about a year ago.
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?
Put your money where you mouth is."
Not just showing up every now and then.
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.
I take lunch hour. (Applause)
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.
Not just show up to class every now and then.
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.
One of the things that I've done for my science students
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.
No calculus, I'll cut out that.
You won't need to know trig.
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,
and we're going to do serious experiments.
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.
We're going to be doing genuine physics."
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.
(High-pitched tone)
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for
was to measure the speed of light.
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --
measured the speed of light.
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of
who have measured the speed of light?
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"
I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,
and measure the speed of light.
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!
And there's no time to do it.
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound
is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"
And all of you know the wave equation is
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --
over here, that's what's interesting --
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,
pitch goes down, things stretch out.
Right? This is simple physics.
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --
but they should have, and I wish they had,
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound
or light, you get a constant.
And that constant is the speed of sound.
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.
I've got a frequency counter right here.
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.
Now, so I know the frequency.
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.
All I need now is to flip on another beam,
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,
you'll notice the spiral.
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,
coming out this way.
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,
but bear with me. (Laughter)
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --
one full wave -- over to here.
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.
Let's figure out what this is.
(Laughter) (Applause)
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --
not bad. Pretty good.
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.
There's a riot going on on campus,
and the police are chasing me, right?
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,
"You! You're a student."
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.
This cop comes after me with a rifle.
He wants to clunk me over the head!
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.
The cop's chasing me.
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.
Chases me into this room.
The entranceway to the bell tower.
I slam the door behind me, climb up,
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,
that you climb up this wooden ladder.
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.
Namely, that when they cast bells,
they write inscriptions on them.
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:
"All truth is one.
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."
Thank you very much.
When I knew I was going to come to speak to you, I thought,
"I gotta call my mother."
I have a little Cuban mother -- she's about that big.
Four feet. Nothing larger than the sum of her figurative parts.
You still with me? (Laughter)
I called her up.
"Hello, how're you doing, baby?"
"Hey, ma, I got to talk to you."
"You're talking to me already. What's the matter?"
I said, "I've got to talk to a bunch of nice people."
"You're always talking to nice people, except when you went
to the White House."
"Ma, don't start!"
And I told her I was coming to TED, and she said,
"What's the problem?"
And I said, "Well, I'm not sure."
I said, "I have to talk to them about stories.
It's 'Technology, Entertainment and Design.'"
And she said, "Well, you design a story when you make it up,
it's entertainment when you tell it,
and you're going to use a microphone."
I said, "You're a peach, ma. Pop there?"
"What's the matter? The pearls of wisdom
leaping from my lips like lemmings is no good for you?"
(Laughter)
Then my pop got on there.
My pop, he's one of the old souls, you know --
old Cuban man from Camaguey.
Camaguey is a province in Cuba.
He's from Florida.
He was born there in 1924.
He grew up in a bohio of dirt floors,
and the structure was the kind used by the Tainos,
our old Arawak ancestors.
My father is at once quick-witted, wickedly funny,
and then poignancy turns on a dime and leaves you breathless.
"Papi, help."
"I already heard your mother. I think she's right."
(Laughter)
"After what I just told you?"
My whole life, my father's been there.
So we talked for a few minutes, and he said,
"Why don't you tell them what you believe?"
I love that, but we don't have the time.
Good storytelling is crafting a story that someone wants to listen to.
Great story is the art of letting go.
So I'm going to tell you a little story.
Remember, this tradition comes to us
not from the mists of Avalon, back in time, but further still,
before we were scratching out these stories on papyrus,
or we were doing the pictographs on walls in moist, damp caves.
Back then, we had an urge, a need, to tell the story.
When Lexus wants to sell you a car, they're telling you a story.
Have you been watching the commercials?
Because every one of us has this desire, for once -- just once --
to tell our story and have it heard.
There are stories you tell from stages.
There's stories that you may tell
in a small group of people with some good wine.
And there's stories you tell late at night to a friend,
maybe once in your life.
I'm not telling you that story.
I'm telling you this one.
It's called, "You're Going to Miss Me."
It's about human connection.
My Cuban mother, which I just briefly introduced you to
in that short character sketch,
came to the United States one thousand years ago.
I was born in 19 -- I forget, and I came to this country
with them in the aftermath of the Cuban revolution.
We went from Havana, Cuba to Decatur, Georgia.
And Decatur, Georgia's a small Southern town.
And in that little Southern town, I grew up,
and grew up hearing these stories.
But this story only happened a few years ago.
I called my mom.
It was a Saturday morning.
And I was calling about how to make ajiaco. It's a Cuban meal.
It's delicious. It's savory.
It makes spit froth in the little corners of your mouth --
is that enough? It makes your armpits juicy, you know?
That kind of food, yeah.
This is the sensory part of the program, people.
I called my mother, and she said, "Carmen, I need you to come, please.
I need to go to the mall, and you know your father now,
he takes a nap in the afternoon, and I got to go.
I got an errand to run."
Let me parenthetically pause here and tell you --
Esther, my mother, had stopped driving several years ago,
to the collective relief of the entire city of Atlanta.
Any vehicular outing with that woman from the time I was a young child,
guys, naturally included flashing, blue lights.
But she'd become adept at dodging the boys in blue,
and when she did meet them, oh, she had wonderful, well, rapport.
"Ma'am, did you know that was a light you just ran?"
(Spanish)
"You don't speak English?"
"No."
(Laughter)
But eventually, every dog has its day,
and she ended up in traffic court,
where she bartered with the judge for a discount.
There's a historical marker.
But now she was a septuagenarian, she'd stopped driving.
And that meant that everyone in the family had to sign up
to take her to have her hair dyed, you know,
that peculiar color of blue that matches her polyester pants suit,
you know, same color as the Buick.
Anybody? All right.
Little picks on the legs, where she does her needlepoint, and leaves little loops.
Rockports -- they're for this.
That's why they call them that.
(Laughter)
This is her ensemble.
And this is the woman that wants me to come on a Saturday morning
when I have a lot to do, but it doesn't take long because Cuban guilt is a weighty thing.
I'm not going political on you but ... And so, I go to my mother's.
I show up. She's in the carport.
Of course, they have a carport.
The kind with the corrugated roof, you know.
The Buick's parked outside,
and she's jingling, jangling a pair of keys.
"I got a surprise for you, baby!"
"We taking your car?"
"Not we, I."
And she reaches into her pocket and pulls out a catastrophe.
Somebody's storytelling. Interactive art. You can talk to me.
Oh, a driver's license, a perfectly valid driver's license.
Issued, evidently, by the DMV in her own county of Gwinnett.
Blithering fucking idiots.
(Laughter)
I said, "Is that thing real?"
"I think so."
"Can you even see?"
"I guess I must."
"Oh, Jesus."
She gets into the car -- she's sitting on two phone books.
I can't even make this part up because she's that tiny.
She's engineered an umbrella so she can -- bam! -- slam the door.
Her daughter, me, the village idiot with the ice cream cone
in the middle of her forehead, is still standing there, slack-jawed.
"You coming? You no coming?"
"Oh, my God." I said, "OK, fine. Does pop know you're driving?"
"Are you kidding me?"
"How are you doing it?"
"He's got to sleep sometime."
And so we left my father fast asleep, because I knew he'd kill me
if I let her go by herself, and we get in the car.
Puts it in reverse. Fifty-five out of the driveway, in reverse.
I am buckling in seatbelts from the front.
I'm yanking them in from the back. I'm doing double knots.
I mean, I've got a mouth as dry as the Kalahari Desert.
I've got a white-knuckle grip on the door. You know what I'm talking about?
And she's whistling, and finally I do the kind of
birth breathing -- you know, that one?
Only a couple of women are going uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh. Right.
And I said, "Ma, would you slow down?"
Because now she's picked up the Highway 285,
the perimeter around Atlanta, which encompasses now --
there's seven lanes, she's on all of them, y'all.
I said, "Ma, pick a lane!"
"They give you seven lanes, they expect you to use them."
And there she goes, right.
I don't believe for a minute she has been out and not been stopped.
So, I think, hey, we can talk. It'll be a diversion.
It'll help my breathing. It'll do something for my pulse, maybe.
"Mommy, I know you have been stopped."
"No, no, what you talking about?"
"You have a license. How long have you been driving?"
"Four or five days."
"Yeah. And you haven't been stopped?"
"I did not get a ticket."
I said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, but come on, come on, come on."
"OK, so I stopped at a light
and there's a guy, you know, in the back."
"Would this guy have, like, a blue uniform
and a terrified look on his face?"
"You weren't there, don't start."
"Come on. You got a ticket?"
"No." She explained,
"The man" -- I have to tell you as she did,
because it loses something if I don't, you know --
"he come to the window, and he does a thing like this,
So I look up and I'm thinking,
maybe he's still going to think I'm kind of cute."
"Ma, are you still doing that?"
"If it works, it works, baby.
So, I say, 'Perdon, yo no hablo ingles.'
Well, wouldn't you know, he had been in Honduras for the Peace Corps."
(Laughter)
So he's talking to her, and at some point she says,
"Then, you know, it was it. That was it. It was done."
"Yeah? What?
He gave you a ticket? He didn't give you a ticket? What?"
You should be terrified.
Now, I don't know if she's toying with me,
kind of like a cat batting back a mouse, batting back a mouse --
left paw, right paw, left paw, right paw --
but by now, we've reached the mall.
Now, you have all been at a mall during the holidays, yes?
Talk to me. Yes. Yes. You can say yes.
Audience: Yes.
Carmen Agra Deedy: All right, then you know that you have now entered parking lot purgatory,
praying to that saint of perpetual availability
that as you join that serpentine line of cars crawling along,
some guy's going to turn on the brake lights
just as you pull up behind him.
But that doesn't happen most of the time, right?
So, first I say, "Ma, why are we here?"
"You mean, like, in the car?"
"No, don't -- why are we here today?
It's Saturday. It's the holidays."
"Because I have to exchange your father's underwear."
Now, see, this is the kind of Machiavellian thinking,
that you really have to -- you know, in my mind, it's a rabbit's warren,
this woman's mind.
Do I want to walk in, because unless I have Ariadne's thread to anchor --
enough metaphors for you? -- somewhere, I may not get out.
But you know.
"Why do we have to take pop's underwear back now?
And why? What is wrong with his underwear?"
"It will upset you."
"It won't upset me. Why? What? Is something wrong with him?"
"No, no, no. The only thing with him is, he's an idiot.
I sent him to the store, which was my first mistake,
and he went to buy underwear, and he bought the grippers,
"Why?"
"I read it on the Intersnet. You cannot have children."
"Oh, my God!"
By now, we have now crawled another four feet,
and my mother finally says to me, "I knew it, I knew it.
I'm an immigrant. We make a space. What I tell you? Right there."
And she points out the passenger window, and I look out,
"Look, the Chevy."
You want to laugh, but you don't know --
you're that politically corrected, have you noticed?
Correct the other direction now, it's OK.
"Look, the Chevy -- he's coming this way."
"Mama, mama, mama, wait, wait, wait. The Chevy is three aisles away."
She looks at me like I'm her, you know, her moron child,
the cretin, the one she's got to speak to very slowly and distinctly.
"I know that, honey. Get out of the car
and go stand in the parking space till I get there."
OK, I want a vote. Come on, come on. No, no.
How many of you once in your -- you were a kid, you were an adult --
you stood in a parking space to hold it for someone?
See, we're a secret club with a secret handshake.
(Laughter)
And years of therapy later, we're doing great.
We're doing great. We're doing fine.
Well, I stood up to her.
This is -- you know, you'd think by now I'm -- and still holding?
I said, "No way, ma, you have embarrassed me my entire life."
Of course, her comeback is, "When have I embarrassed you?"
(Spanish)
And she's still talking while she puts the car in park,
hits the emergency brake, opens the door,
and with a spryness astounding in a woman her age,
she jumps out of the car, knocks out the phone books,
and then she walks around --
she's carrying her cheap Kmart purse with her --
around the front of the car.
usual religious charity that the holidays bring us, wah-wah wah-wah.
"I'm coming." Italian hand signals follow.
This is new and fast, just so you -- are you still with us?
We'll wait for the slow ones. OK.
I start, and this is where a child says to me --
and the story doesn't work if I tell you about her before,
because this is my laconic child.
A brevity, brevity of everything with this child.
You know, she eats small portions.
Language is something to be meted out
in small phonemes, you know -- just little hmm, hmm-hmm.
She carries a mean spiral notebook and a pen.
She wields great power.
She listens, because that's what people who tell stories do first.
But she pauses occasionally and says,
"How do you spell that? What year? OK."
When she writes the expose in about 20 years,
don't believe a word of it.
But this is my daughter, Lauren, my remarkable daughter,
She says, "Ma, you got to look!"
Now, when this kid says I got to look, you know.
But it isn't like I haven't seen this crime scene before.
I grew up with this woman.
I said, "Lauren, you know what, give me a play-by-play. I can't."
"No, mama, you got to look."
I got to look. You got to look.
Don't you want to look?
There she is.
I look in bewildered awe:
she's standing, those Rockports slightly apart, but grounded.
She's holding out that cheap Kmart purse, and she is wielding it.
She's holding back tons of steel with the sheer force
of her little personality, in that crone-ish voice, saying things like,
"Back it up, buddy! No, it's reserved!"
(Laughter)
Ready? Brace yourselves. Here it comes.
"No, my daughter, she's coming in the Buick.
Honey, sit up so they can see you."
Oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.
I finally come -- and now, it's the South.
I don't know what part of the country you live in.
I think we all secretly love stories.
We all secretly want our blankie and our Boo Bear.
We want to curl up and say, "Tell it to me, tell it to me.
Come on, honey, tell it to me."
But in the South, we love a good story.
People have pulled aside,
I mean, they've come out of that queue line,
they have popped their trunks, pulled out lawn chairs and cool drinks.
Bets are placed.
"I'm with the little lady. Damn!"
(Laughter)
And she's bringing me in with a slight salsa movement.
She is, after all, Cuban.
I'm thinking, "Accelerator, break. Accelerator, break."
Like you've never thought that in your life? Right? Yeah.
I pull in. I put the car in park.
Engine's still running -- mine, not the car.
I jump out next to her going, "Don't you move!"
"I'm not going anywhere."
She's got front seat in a Greek tragedy.
I come out, and there's Esther.
"Que?" Which means "what," and so much more.
"Ma, have you no shame?
People are watching us all around," right?
Now, some of them you've got to make up, people.
Secret of the trade.
Guess what? Some of these stories I sculpt a little, here and there.
Some, they're just right there, right there. Put them right there.
She says this to me.
After I say -- let me refresh you --
"No. I gave it up with pantyhose -- they're both too binding."
(Laughter)
Yeah, you can clap, but then you're about 30 seconds from the end.
I'm about to snap like a brittle twig, when suddenly someone taps me on the shoulder.
Intrepid soul.
I'm thinking, "This is my kid. How dare she?
She jumped out of that car."
That's OK, because my mother yells at me, I yell at her.
It's a beautiful hierarchy, and it works.
(Laughter)
I turn around, but it's not a child. It's a young woman,
a little taller than I, pale green, amused eyes.
With her is a young man -- husband, brother, lover, it's not my job.
And she says, "Pardon me, ma'am" -- that's how we talk down there --
"is that your mother?"
I said, "No, I follow little old women around parking lots
to see if they'll stop. Yes, it's my mother!"
The boy, now, he says. "Well, what my sister meant" --
I said, (Spanish), and the young girl and the young boy say,
"No, no, honey, we just want to know one more thing."
I said, "Look, please, let me take care of her, OK,
because I know her, and believe me, she's like a small atomic weapon,
you know, you just want to handle her really gingerly."
And the girl goes, "I know, but, I mean, I swear to God,
I almost miss it.
He turns to her on the heel of his shoe.
They turn then, shoulder to shoulder, and walk away,
lost in their own reverie.
And I turn to Esther, who's rocking on those 'ports, and says,
"You know what, honey?"
"I'm going to drive you crazy probably for about 14, 15 more years,
which is that if I've learned anything over the last year,
it's that the supreme irony
of publishing a book about slowness
is that you have to go around promoting it really fast.
I seem to spend most of my time these days
zipping from city to city, studio to studio,
interview to interview,
serving up the book in really tiny bite-size chunks.
Because everyone these days
wants to know how to slow down,
but they want to know how to slow down really quickly. So ...
so I did a spot on CNN the other day
where I actually spent more time in makeup than I did talking on air.
And I think that -- that's not really surprising though, is it?
Because that's kind of the world that we live in now,
a world stuck in fast-forward.
with doing everything faster, with cramming more and more
into less and less time.
Every moment of the day feels like
a race against the clock.
To borrow a phrase from Carrie Fisher, which is
in my bio there; I'll just toss it out again --
"These days even instant gratification takes too long." (Laughter)
And
if you think about how we to try to make things better, what do we do?
No, we speed them up, don't we? So we used to dial; now we speed dial.
We used to read; now we speed read. We used to walk; now we speed walk.
And of course, we used to date and now we speed date.
And even things that are by their very nature slow --
we try and speed them up too.
So I was in New York recently, and I walked past a gym
that had an advertisement in the window for a new course, a new evening course.
And it was for, you guessed it, speed yoga.
So this -- the perfect solution for time-starved professionals
who want to, you know, salute the sun,
but only want to give over about 20 minutes to it.
I mean, these are sort of the extreme examples,
and they're amusing and good to laugh at.
and I think that in the headlong dash of daily life,
we often lose sight of the damage
that this roadrunner form of living does to us.
We're so marinated in the culture of speed
that we almost fail to notice the toll it takes
on every aspect of our lives --
on our health, our diet, our work,
our relationships, the environment and our community.
And sometimes it takes
a wake-up call, doesn't it,
to alert us to the fact that we're hurrying through our lives,
instead of actually living them; that we're
living the fast life, instead of the good life.
And I think for many people, that wake-up call
takes the form of an illness.
You know, a burnout, or eventually the body says,
"I can't take it anymore," and throws in the towel.
Or maybe a relationship goes up in smoke
because we haven't had the time, or the patience,
or the tranquility,
to be with the other person, to listen to them.
reading bedtime stories to my son,
and I found that at the end of day,
I would go into his room and I just couldn't slow down -- you know,
I'd be speed reading "The Cat In The Hat."
I'd be -- you know, I'd be skipping lines here,
paragraphs there, sometimes a whole page,
and of course, my little boy knew the book inside out, so we would quarrel.
And what should have been the most relaxing, the most intimate,
the most tender moment of the day,
when a dad sits down to read to his son,
became instead this kind of gladiatorial battle of wills,
a clash between my speed
and his slowness.
And this went on for some time,
until I caught myself scanning a newspaper article
with timesaving tips for fast people.
And one of them made reference to a series of books called
"The One-Minute Bedtime Story."
And I wince saying those words now,
but my first reaction at the time was very different.
My first reflex was to say,
"Hallelujah -- what a great idea!
This is exactly what I'm looking for to speed up bedtime even more."
But thankfully,
a light bulb went on over my head, and my next reaction was very different,
and I took a step back, and I thought,
"Whoa -- you know, has it really come to this?
Am I really in such a hurry that I'm prepared
to fob off my son with a sound byte at the end of the day?"
And I put away the newspaper --
and I was getting on a plane -- and I sat there,
and I did something I hadn't done for a long time -- which is I did nothing.
I just thought, and I thought long and hard.
And by the time I got off that plane, I'd decided I wanted to do something about it.
I wanted to investigate this whole roadrunner culture,
and what it was doing to me and to everyone else.
The first was, how did we get so fast?
And the second is, is it possible,
or even desirable, to slow down?
Now, if you think about
how our world got so accelerated, the usual suspects rear their heads.
You think of, you know, urbanization,
consumerism, the workplace, technology.
But I think if you cut through
those forces, you get to what might be the deeper
driver, the nub of the question,
which is how we think about time itself.
In other cultures, time is cyclical.
It's seen as moving in great,
unhurried circles.
It's always renewing and refreshing itself.
Whereas in the West, time is linear.
It's a finite resource;
it's always draining away.
You either use it, or lose it.
"Time is money," as Benjamin Franklin said.
And I think what that does to us psychologically
is it creates an equation.
Time is scarce, so what do we do?
Well -- well, we speed up, don't we?
We try and do more and more with less and less time.
We turn every moment of every day
into a race to the finish line --
a finish line, incidentally, that we never reach,
but a finish line nonetheless.
And I guess that the question is,
is it possible to break free from that mindset?
And thankfully, the answer is yes, because
what I discovered, when I began looking around, that there is
a global backlash against this culture that
tells us that faster is always better, and that busier is best.
they're slowing down, and finding that,
although conventional wisdom tells you that if you slow down, you're road kill,
the opposite turns out to be true:
that by slowing down at the right moments,
people find that they do everything better.
They eat better; they make love better; they exercise better;
they work better; they live better.
And, in this kind of cauldron
of moments and places and acts of deceleration,
lie what a lot of people now refer to as
the "International Slow Movement."
I'll just give you a very quick overview of
what's going on inside the Slow Movement. If you think of food,
many of you will have heard of the Slow Food movement.
Started in Italy, but has spread across the world,
and now has 100,000 members
in 50 countries.
And it's driven by a very simple and sensible message,
which is that we get more pleasure and more health
from our food when we
cultivate, cook and consume it at a reasonable pace.
I think also the explosion of
the organic farming movement, and the renaissance of farmers' markets,
are other illustrations
of the fact that people are desperate to get away from
eating and cooking and cultivating their food
on an industrial timetable.
They want to get back to slower rhythms.
And out of the Slow Food movement has grown something
called the Slow Cities movement, which has started in Italy,
but has spread right across Europe and beyond.
And in this, towns
begin to rethink how they organize the urban landscape,
so that people are encouraged to slow down
and smell the roses and connect with one another.
So they might curb traffic,
or put in a park bench, or some green space.
because I think when a Slow City becomes officially a Slow City,
it's kind of like a philosophical declaration.
It's saying to the rest of world, and to the people in that town,
that we believe that in the 21st century,
slowness has a role to play.
In medicine, I think a lot of people are deeply disillusioned
with the kind of quick-fix mentality
you find in conventional medicine.
And millions of them around the world are turning
to complementary and alternative forms of medicine,
which tend to tap into sort of
slower, gentler, more holistic forms of healing.
Now, obviously the jury is out on many of these complementary therapies,
and I personally doubt that the coffee enema
will ever, you know, gain mainstream approval.
But other treatments
such as acupuncture and massage, and even just relaxation,
clearly have some kind of benefit.
And blue-chip medical colleges everywhere
are starting to study these things to find out how they work,
and what we might learn from them.
I was coming to --
well -- no pun intended there.
I was making my way, let's say, slowly to Oxford,
and I went through a news agent, and I saw a magazine,
a men's magazine, and it said on the front,
"How to bring your partner to orgasm in 30 seconds."
So, you know, even sex
is on a stopwatch these days.
Now, you know,
I like a quickie as much as the next person,
but I think that there's an awful lot to be gained
from slow sex -- from slowing down in the bedroom.
You know, you tap into that -- those deeper,
sort of, psychological, emotional, spiritual currents,
and you get a better orgasm with the buildup.
You can get more bang for your buck, let's say.
I mean, the Pointer Sisters said it most eloquently, didn't they,
when they sang the praises of "a lover with a slow hand."
Now, we all laughed at Sting
a few years ago when he went Tantric,
but you fast-forward a few years, and now you find couples of all ages
flocking to workshops, or maybe just
on their own in their own bedrooms, finding ways
to put on the brakes and have better sex.
And of course, in Italy where -- I mean, Italians always seem to know
where to find their pleasure --
they've launched an official Slow Sex movement.
Right across much of the world --
North America being a notable exception --
working hours have been coming down.
And Europe is an example of that,
and people finding that their quality of life improves
as they're working less, and also
that their hourly productivity goes up.
Now, clearly there are problems with
the 35-hour workweek in France --
too much, too soon, too rigid.
But other countries in Europe, notably the Nordic countries,
are showing that it's possible
to have a kick-ass economy
without being a workaholic.
And Norway, Sweden,
Denmark and Finland now rank
among the top six most competitive nations on Earth,
and they work the kind of hours that would make the average American
weep with envy.
And if you go beyond sort of the country level,
down at the micro-company level,
more and more companies now are realizing
that they need to allow their staff
either to work fewer hours or just to unplug --
to take a lunch break, or to go sit in a quiet room,
to switch off their Blackberrys and laptops -- you at the back --
mobile phones,
during the work day or on the weekend, so that they have time to recharge
and for the brain to slide into that
kind of creative mode of thought.
adults who overwork, though, is it? It's children, too.
I'm 37, and my childhood ended in the mid-'80s,
and I look at kids now, and I'm just amazed by the way they
race around with more homework,
more tutoring, more extracurriculars
than we would ever have conceived of a generation ago.
And some of the most heartrending emails
that I get on my website
are actually from adolescents
hovering on the edge of burnout, pleading with me
to write to their parents,
to help them slow down, to help them get off this
full-throttle treadmill.
But thankfully, there is a backlash there in parenting as well,
and you're finding that, you know, towns in the United States
are now banding together and banning extracurriculars
on a particular day of the month, so that people can,
you know, decompress and have some family time, and slow down.
springing up all over the developed world
in schools which had been piling on the homework for years,
and now they're discovering that less can be more.
So there was a case up in Scotland recently
where a fee-paying, high-achieving private school
banned homework
for everyone under the age of 13,
and the high-achieving parents freaked out and said,
"What are you -- you know, our kids will fall" -- the headmaster said,
"No, no, your children need to slow down at the end of the day."
And just this last month, the exam results came in,
and in math, science, marks went up 20 percent
on average last year.
And I think what's very revealing is that
the elite universities, who are often cited as the reason
that people drive their kids and hothouse them so much,
are starting to notice the caliber of students
coming to them is falling. These kids have wonderful marks;
they have CVs jammed with extracurriculars,
to the point that would make your eyes water.
But they lack spark; they lack
the ability to think creatively and think outside --
they don't know how to dream. And so what these Ivy League schools,
and Oxford and Cambridge and so on, are starting to send a message
to parents and students that they need to put on the brakes a little bit.
And in Harvard, for instance, they send out
a letter to undergraduates -- freshmen --
telling them that they'll get more out of life, and more out of Harvard,
if they put on the brakes, if they do less,
but give time to things, the time that things need,
to enjoy them, to savor them.
And even if they sometimes do nothing at all.
And that letter is called -- very revealing, I think --
"Slow Down!" -- with an exclamation mark on the end.
that less is very often more,
that slower is very often
better. But that said, of course,
it's not that easy to slow down, is it?
I mean, you heard that I got a speeding ticket
while I was researching my book on the benefits of slowness,
and that's true, but that's not all of it.
I was actually en route to a dinner
held by Slow Food at the time.
And if that's not shaming enough, I got that ticket in Italy.
And if any of you have ever driven on an Italian highway,
you'll have a pretty good idea of how fast I was going.
I think there are various reasons.
One is that speed is fun, you know, speed is sexy.
It's all that adrenaline rush. It's hard to give it up.
I think there's a kind of metaphysical dimension --
that speed becomes a way of walling ourselves off
from the bigger, deeper questions.
We fill our head with distraction, with busyness,
so that we don't have to ask,
am I well? Am I happy? Are my children growing up right?
Are politicians making good decisions on my behalf?
Another reason -- although I think, perhaps, the most powerful reason --
why we find it hard to slow down is the cultural taboo
that we've erected against slowing down.
"Slow" is a dirty word in our culture.
It's a byword for "lazy," "slacker,"
for being somebody who gives up.
You know, "he's a bit slow." It's actually synonymous
with being stupid.
or its main goal, really, is to tackle that taboo,
and to say that yes,
sometimes slow is not the answer,
that there is such a thing as "bad slow."
You know, I got stuck on the M25,
which is a ring road around London, recently,
and spent three-and-a-half hours there. And I can tell you,
that's really bad slow.
But the new idea,
the sort of revolutionary idea, of the Slow Movement,
is that there is such a thing as "good slow," too.
And good slow is, you know, taking the time
to eat a meal with your family, with the TV switched off.
Or taking the time to look at a problem from all angles
in the office to make the best decision
at work.
Or even simply just taking the time
to slow down
and savor your life.
about all of this stuff that's happened around the book
since it came out, is the reaction to it.
And I knew that when my book on slowness came out,
it would be welcomed by the New Age brigade,
but it's also been taken up, with great gusto,
by the corporate world -- you know,
business press, but also
big companies and leadership organizations.
Because people at the top of the chain, people like you, I think,
are starting to realize that there's too much
speed in the system,
there's too much busyness, and it's time to find,
or get back to that lost art of shifting gears.
Another encouraging sign, I think,
is that it's not just in the developed world
that this idea's been taken up. In the developing world,
in countries that are on the verge of making that leap
into first world status -- China, Brazil,
Thailand, Poland, and so on --
these countries have embraced the idea of the Slow Movement,
many people in them, and there's a debate going on
in their media, on the streets.
Because I think they're looking at the West, and they're saying,
"Well, we like that aspect of what you've got,
but we're not so sure about that."
I guess, is it possible?
That's really the main question before us today. Is it possible
to slow down? And
I'm happy to be able to say to you
that the answer is a resounding yes.
And I present myself as Exhibit A,
a kind of reformed and rehabilitated
speed-aholic.
I still love speed. You know, I live in London,
and I work as a journalist,
and I enjoy the buzz and the busyness,
and the adrenaline rush that comes from both of those things.
I play squash and ice hockey,
two very fast sports, and I wouldn't give them up for the world.
But I've also, over the last year or so,
got in touch with my inner tortoise.
I no longer
overload myself gratuitously.
My default mode is no longer
to be a rush-aholic.
I no longer hear
time's winged chariot drawing near,
or at least not as much as I did before.
I can actually hear it now, because I see my time is ticking off.
And the upshot of all of that is that
I actually feel a lot happier, healthier,
more productive than I ever have.
I feel like I'm living
my life rather than actually just racing through it.
And perhaps, the most important
measure of the success of this
is that I feel that my relationships are a lot deeper,
richer, stronger.
for whether this would work, and what it would mean,
was always going to be bedtime stories, because that's sort of where
the journey began. And there too the news is
rosy. You know,
at the end of the day, I go into my son's room.
I don't wear a watch. I switch off my computer,
so I can't hear the email pinging into the basket,
and I just slow down to his pace and we read.
And because children have their own tempo and internal clock,
they don't do quality time,
where you schedule 10 minutes for them to open up to you.
They need you to move at their rhythm.
I find that 10 minutes into a story, you know,
my son will suddenly say, "You know,
something happened in the playground today that really bothered me."
And we'll go off and have a conversation on that.
And I now find that bedtime stories
used to be
a box on my to-do list, something that I dreaded,
because it was so slow and I had to get through it quickly.
It's become my reward at the end of the day,
something I really cherish.
And I have a kind of Hollywood ending
to my talk this afternoon,
which goes a little bit like this:
another book tour, and I had my bags packed.
I was downstairs by the front door, and I was waiting for a taxi,
and my son came down the stairs and
he'd made a card for me. And he was carrying it.
He'd gone and stapled two cards, very like these, together,
and put a sticker of his favorite
character, Tintin, on the front.
And he said to me,
or he handed this to me, and I read it,
and it said, "To Daddy, love Benjamin."
And I thought, "Aw, that's really sweet.
Is that a good luck on the book tour card?"
And he said, "No, no, no, Daddy -- this is a card
for being the best story reader in the world."
And I thought, "Yeah, you know, this slowing down thing really does work."
I'm going to take you on a journey very quickly.
To explain the wish, I'm going to have to take you somewhere
to get architects and designers involved in humanitarian work,
not only about responding to natural disasters,
We believe that where the resources and expertise are scarce,
and I was always interested in socially responsible design,
and how you can really make an impact.
But when I went to architecture school,
it seemed that I was a black sheep in the family.
Many architects seemed to think that when you design,
you design a jewel, and it's a jewel that you try and crave for;
whereas I felt that when you design,
you either improve or you create a detriment
for returning refugees in Kosovo.
And I didn't know what I was doing -- like I said, mid-20s --
and I'm the Internet generation, so we started a website.
We put a call out there, and to my surprise, in a couple of months,
That led to a number of prototypes being built
and really experimenting with some ideas.
Two years later we started doing a project
on developing mobile health clinics in sub-Saharan Africa,
We also have designers from around the world that participate.
And we had an exhibit of work that followed that.
2004 was the tipping point for us.
We started responding to natural disasters
and getting involved in Iran, in Bam,
also following up on our work in Africa.
most people look at poverty and they see the face of a foreigner.
But I live in Bozeman, Montana --
go up to the north plains on the reservations,
So we got involved in and worked in inner cities and elsewhere;
2005: Mother Nature kicked our ass.
I think we can pretty much assume that 2005 was a horrific year
when it comes to natural disasters.
And because of the Internet,
getting involved, working with people on the ground.
I had 4,000 emails from people needing help.
So we began to get involved in projects there,
and I'll talk about some others.
And then of course, this year we've been responding to Katrina,
as well as following up on our reconstruction work.
or the number of requests that I was getting.
It was all coming into my laptop and cell phone.
so that anyone, anywhere in the world, could start a local chapter,
and they can get involved in local problems.
Because I believe there is no such thing as Utopia.
All problems are local. All solutions are local.
and we ended up having 40 chapters starting up,
OK, because I'm going to do it very quick.
What it showed me is that there's a grassroots movement going on,
but also disaster mitigation and dealing with public policy.
Instigation, developing ideas with communities and NGOs,
doing open-source design competitions.
Referring, matchmaking with communities.
And then implementing -- actually going out there and doing the work,
because when you invent, it's never a reality until it's built.
So it's really important that if we're designing
and trying to create change, we build that change.
that would be placed next to the land the resident lived in,
This wasn't imposing an architecture on a community;
We had from the sublime to the ridiculous, but they worked.
And a whole variety of ideas
that not only dealt with architectural building,
but also the issues of governance,
and the idea of creating communities through complex networks.
And then something remarkable happened in '99.
Within three days, we realized the problem was not housing;
it was the growing pandemic of HIV/AIDS.
And it wasn't doctors telling us this;
it was actual villagers that we were staying with.
So in a way, we had taken pre-existing needs and shown solutions.
because the idea is that architecture is not just about solutions,
but about raising awareness.
and it grows 14 feet in a month.
And on the fourth week, the doctors come and they mow out an area,
and seeing patients and villagers,
you also need to have nutrition rates,
and the idea of nutrition is as important
and economic engines within the community,
so it can be a self-sustaining project.
That's not because I'm a tree-hugging green person.
you're living on survival and you have to be sustainable.
and you have to keep the maintenance down.
So this is about getting an economic engine,
"The problem is that the girls don't have education."
And we're working in an area
where young women between the ages of 16 and 24
And that's not because they're promiscuous,
it's because there's no knowledge.
and the coaches of the girls' team were also trained doctors.
and then those nine finalists were distributed throughout the entire region,
and then the community picked their design.
They said, this is our design,
because it's not only about engaging a community;
it's about empowering a community,
And I also play in the Vodacom League, for the team called Tembisa,
And we start construction in June, and it will be opened by TEDGlobal.
So when you come to TEDGlobal, you can check it out.
such as the tsunami and also things like Hurricane Katrina.
This is a 370-dollar shelter that can be easily assembled.
And what that means is we actually live and work with the community,
The kids actually get involved in mapping out
end up building the building with us.
This is what the UN gave these guys for six months -- 12 plastic tarps.
So we said, if the rain's coming down, let's get fresh water.
This was raised by hot chocolate sales in Atlanta.
The kids are out there on-site, building the buildings.
And it opened a couple of weeks ago,
and there's 600 kids that are now using the schools.
We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that,
but we don't see the good stories.
Here is a community that got together, and they said "no" to waiting.
They formed a partnership, a diverse partnership of players,
to actually map out East Biloxi,
to figure out who's getting involved.
Figuring out what FEMA regulations are,
not waiting for them to dictate to us how you should rebuild.
This is a utility room for a woman who is on a walker.
She's 70 years old. This is what FEMA gave her.
We put together, very quickly, a washroom.
They're photographers who had documented the Lower Ninth for the last 40 years.
That was their home, and these are the photographs they took.
And we're helping, working with them to create a new building.
This is the new UN tent, just introduced this year.
It took 20 years to design this and get it implemented in the field.
There are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
and hundreds of architects and designers and inventors
More hemp houses -- it's a theme in Japan, apparently.
I'm not sure what they're smoking.
This guy designed for NASA, is now doing housing.
I'm going to whip through this quickly,
I showed you something that took 20 years to do.
Alabama,
Vietnam.
I'm sure that's how he wanted to spend the party.
What I see is many, many inventors.
One in seven live in unplanned settlements.
With 10 million solutions.
Open-source architecture is the way to go.
it's as a conduit between the design world and the humanitarian world.
And what we need is something that replicates me globally,
because I haven't slept in seven years.
Designers want to respond to issues of humanitarian crisis,
but they don't want some company in the West
taking their idea and basically profiting from it.
So Creative Commons has developed the Developing Nations license.
As soon as that is built, anyone in Africa or any developing nation
but still protect their rights here?
We want to have a community where you can upload ideas,
That's too late, we need to do it now.
So doing that globally --
and I want this whole thing to work multi-lingually.
When you look at the face of an architect, most people think a gray-haired white guy.
I don't see that; I see the face of the world.
So I want everyone from all over the planet
to be able to be a part of this design and development.
and putting funding partners together,
Because you know what? Innovation will happen.
And I need to know that. It's called the leap-back.
These ideas are supposed to be adaptable;
So it's important to have these proven ideas put up there,
easy to use, easy to get ahold of.
We've changed FEMA guidelines; we've changed public policy;
we've changed international response -- based on building things.
I will give points for those who know it.
But I think the man was maybe 25 years too early.
We stand a very big chance of losing our ability to inspire our youth
to go out and continue this very important thing
that we as a species have always done.
And that is, instinctively we've gone out
and climbed over difficult places, went to more hostile places,
and found out later, maybe to our surprise, that that's the reason we survived.
that think that it's OK to look forward to a better version
of a cell phone with a video in it.
They need to look forward to exploration; they need to look forward to colonization;
they need to look forward to breakthroughs.
We need to inspire them, because they need to lead us
and help us survive in the future.
to -- for this next decade and a half -- oh shoot, I screwed up.
We have real specific instructions here not to talk about politics.
is not only the inspiration of our children,
but the current plan right now is not really even allowing
the most creative people in this country -- the Boeing's and Lockheed's
space engineers -- to go out and take risks and try new stuff.
We're going to go back to the moon ... 50 years later?
I'm really troubled by that. But anyway that's --
who will be our great leaders later.
That's the theme of my next 15 minutes here.
And I think that the inspiration begins when you're very young:
three-year-olds, up to 12-, 14-year-olds.
What they look at is the most important thing.
And there was a wonderful little short four-year time period
thousand of pilots. Airplanes were invented by natural selection.
Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today,
and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.
The ones that flew and landed OK
So we, by making a whole bunch of attempts, thousands of attempts,
in that four-year time period, we invented the concepts
of the airplanes that we fly today. And that's why they're so safe,
as we gave it a lot of chance to find what's good.
That has not happened at all in space flying.
There's only been two concepts tried -- two by the U.S. and one by the Russians.
was a little kid in that wonderful renaissance of aviation.
Well, what happened when I was a little kid was -- some pretty heavy stuff too.
The jet age started: the missile age started. Von Braun was on there
and they've landed it only in the deserts.
and the red line is top-of-the-line military fighters
and the blue line is commercial air transport.
to go out and try something that other people weren't having the courage to try.
Well, what did I do when I was a kid?
I didn't do the hotrods and the girls and the dancing
And then I went in and I had a lot of fun building airplanes
that people could build in their garages.
And some 3,000 of those are flying. Of course, one of them
is around the world Voyager. I founded another company in '82,
which is my company now.
only a dozen years after the first operational jet.
Stayed in service till it was too rusty to fly, taken out of service.
The most impressive spaceship ever, I believe,
was a Grumman Lunar Lander. It was a -- you know, it landed on the moon,
We've lost that capability. We abandoned it in '72.
This thing was designed three years after Gagarin first flew in space in 1961.
have a lot of activity; they die out when they're replaced by something else.
These things tend to happen every 25 years.
40 years long, with an overlap. You can put that statement
on all kinds of different technologies. The interesting thing --
by the way, the speed here, excuse me, higher-speed travel
is the title of these innovation cycles. There is none here.
Here's the biggie, and that is, you don't have innovation cycles
if the government develops and the government uses it.
You know, a good example, of course, is the DARPA net.
Computers were used for artillery first, then IRS.
Keep that in mind. I put down innovation --
and a few weeks later Alan Shepherd, there were five manned
space flights in the world -- the very first year.
In 2003, everyone that the United States sent to space was killed.
to the international manned station. And I had to fly three in Mojave
We know how to do it for sub-orbital flying now, do it safe enough --
And I think I want to talk a little bit about why we had the courage
to go out and try that as a small company.
The first industry will be a high volume, a lot of players.
There's another one announced just last week.
And it will be sub-orbital. And the reason it has to be sub-orbital
and still four percent of the people that have left the atmosphere have died.
That's -- You don't want to run a business with that kind of a safety record.
It'll be very high volume; we think 100,000 people will fly by 2020.
I can't tell you when this will start,
because I don't want my competition to know my schedule.
But I think once it does, we will find solutions,
and very quickly, you'll see those resort hotels in orbit.
And that real easy thing to do, which is a swing around the moon
so you have this cool view. And that will be really cool.
Because the moon doesn't have an atmosphere --
you can do an elliptical orbit and miss it by 10 feet if you want.
Oh, it's going to be so much fun.
a lot of these billionaires' money for joyrides for billionaires.
What's this? This is not a transportation system; it's just for fun."
And I used to be bothered by that, and then I got to thinking,
well, wait a minute. I bought my first Apple computer in 1978
and I bought it because I could say, "I got a computer at my house and you don't.
'What do you use it for?' Come over. It does Frogger." OK.
but the home computer was for games.
And the inventor is in this audience.
Al Gore invented the Internet and because of that,
And it won't be very long before you won't be able to convince kids
that we didn't always have computers in our homes.
So fun is defendable.
but in it is my prediction with what's going to happen.
And in it also brings up another point, right here.
There's a group of people that have come forward --
and you don't know all of them -- but the ones that have come forward
were inspired as young children, this little three- to 15-year-old age,
by us going to orbit and going to the moon here,
right in this time period.
Paul Allen, Elan Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, the Ansari family,
which is now funding the Russians' sub-orbital thing,
Bob Bigelow, a private space station, and Carmack.
These people are taking money and putting it in an interesting area,
and I think it's a lot better than they put it in an area
of a better cell phone or something -- but they're putting it in very --
areas and this will lead us into this kind of capability,
it will allow us to colonize and to keep us from going extinct.
There were a couple of examples here.
The military fighters had a -- highest-performance military airplane
It went a whole life cycle without competition,
took out of service. And we're stuck back here
with the same kind of capability for military fighters
and commercial airline travel that we had back in the late '50s.
And I'm talking about if you've got a baby now,
Relatively soon, you'll be able to buy a ticket
and fly higher and faster than the highest-performance
military operational airplane. It's never happened before.
The fact that they have stuck here with this kind of performance
has been, well, you know, you win the war in 12 minutes;
sub-orbital flights to space, very soon -- wait a minute,
what's happening here, we'll have military fighters
We didn't lose them technically. The fact that we had the hardware
Sputnik wasn't a technical loss, but it was a prestige loss.
America -- the world saw America as not being the leader in technology,
and that was a very strong thing.
And then we flew Alan Shepherd weeks after Gagarin,
You can fly with Russian hardware. This is available
because a Russian space program is starving,
and it's nice for them to get 20 million here and there to take one of the seats.
that the first commercial capitalist-like thing to do
to buy a ticket to go to the moon would be in Russian hardware?
And would you have thought, would the Russians have thought,
that when they first go to the moon in their developed hardware,
the guys inside won't be Russians? Maybe it'll probably be a Japanese
or an American billionaire? Well, that's weird: you know, it really is.
But anyway, I think we need to beat them again.
The Russians actually flew a supersonic transport before the Concorde.
And then they flew a few cargo flights, and took it out of service.
I think you kind of see the same kind of parallel
when the commercial stuff is offered.
This little thing says here: five times
investment in private space flight that is not government at all --
already, worldwide. If you read -- if you Google it,
and planned for the next few years. Hey, that's pretty big.
I'm predicting, though, as profitable as this industry is going to be --
and it certainly is profitable when you fly people at 200,000 dollars
on something that you can actually operate at a tenth of that cost,
or less -- this is going to be very profitable.
I predict, also, that the investment that will flow into this
will be somewhere around half of what the U.S. taxpayer
spends for NASA's manned spacecraft work.
And every dollar that flows into that will be spent more efficiently
by a factor of 10 to 15. And what that means is before we know it,
the progress in human space flight, with no taxpayer dollars,
will be at a level of about five times as much
as the current NASA budgets for human space flight.
And that is because it's us. It's private industry.
You should never depend on the government to do this sort of stuff --
never developed an airliner and never ran an airline.
But NASA is developing the space liner, always has,
when I showed that a little group out there actually can do it,
In the year 1919,
a virtually unknown German mathematician, named Theodor Kaluza
suggested a very bold and, in some ways, a very bizarre idea.
He proposed that our universe
might actually have more than the three dimensions
that we are all aware of.
That is in addition to left, right, back, forth and up, down,
Kaluza proposed that there might be additional dimensions of space
that for some reason we don't yet see.
Now, when someone makes a bold and bizarre idea,
sometimes that's all it is -- bold and bizarre,
but it has nothing to do with the world around us.
This particular idea, however --
although we don't yet know whether it's right or wrong,
and at the end I'll discuss experiments which, in the next few years,
may tell us whether it's right or wrong --
this idea has had a major impact on physics in the last century
and continues to inform a lot of cutting-edge research.
So where do we go?
To begin we need a little bit of back story. Go to 1907.
This is a year when Einstein is basking in the glow
of having discovered the special theory of relativity
and decides to take on a new project,
to try to understand fully the grand, pervasive force of gravity.
And in that moment, there are many people around
who thought that that project had already been resolved.
Newton had given the world a theory of gravity in the late 1600s
that works well, describes the motion of planets,
the motion of the moon and so forth,
the motion of apocryphal of apples falling from trees,
hitting people on the head.
All of that could be described using Newton's work.
because even Newton had written
that although he understood how to calculate the effect of gravity,
he'd been unable to figure out how it really works.
How is it that the Sun, 93 million miles away,
[that] somehow it affects the motion of the Earth?
How does the Sun reach out across empty inert space and exert influence?
And that is a task to which Einstein set himself --
to figure out how gravity works.
And let me show you what it is that he found.
So Einstein found
that the medium that transmits gravity is space itself.
The idea goes like this:
imagine space is a substrate of all there is.
But if there is matter in the environment, such as the Sun,
it causes the fabric of space to warp, to curve.
And that communicates the force of gravity.
Even the Earth warps space around it.
Now look at the Moon.
The Moon is kept in orbit, according to these ideas,
because it rolls along a valley in the curved environment
that the Sun and the Moon and the Earth can all create by virtue of their presence.
We go to a full-frame view of this.
The Earth itself is kept in orbit
because it rolls along a valley in the environment that's curved
because of the Sun's presence.
That is this new idea about how gravity actually works.
It really works. It describes the data.
And this gained Einstein prominence around the world.
And that is what got Kaluza thinking.
He, like Einstein, was in search of what we call a unified theory.
That's one theory
that might be able to describe all of nature's forces from one set of ideas,
one set of principles, one master equation, if you will.
So Kaluza said to himself,
Einstein has been able to describe gravity
in terms of warps and curves in space --
in fact, space and time, to be more precise.
Maybe I can play the same game with the other known force,
which was, at that time, known as the electromagnetic force --
we know of others today, but at that time
that was the only other one people were thinking about.
You know, the force responsible for electricity
and magnetic attraction and so forth.
and describe electromagnetic force in terms of warps and curves.
That raised a question: warps and curves in what?
Einstein had already used up space and time,
warps and curves, to describe gravity.
There didn't seem to be anything else to warp or curve.
So Kaluza said, well, maybe there are more dimensions of space.
He said, if I want to describe one more force,
maybe I need one more dimension.
So he imagined that the world had four dimensions of space, not three,
and imagined that electromagnetism was warps and curves
in that fourth dimension. Now here's the thing:
when he wrote down the equations describing warps and curves
in a universe with four space dimensions, not three,
he found the old equations that Einstein had already derived in three dimensions --
those were for gravity --
but he found one more equation because of the one more dimension.
And when he looked at that equation,
it was none other than the equation
that scientists had long known to describe the electromagnetic force.
Amazing -- it just popped out.
He was so excited by this realization
that he ran around his house screaming, "Victory!" --
that he had found the unified theory.
He, in fact --
there is a story that when he wanted to learn how to swim,
he read a book, a treatise on swimming --
(Laughter)
-- then dove into the ocean.
This is a man who would risk his life on theory.
Now, but for those of us who are a little bit more practically minded,
two questions immediately arise from his observation.
Number one: if there are more dimensions in space, where are they?
We don't seem to see them.
And number two: does this theory really work in detail,
when you try to apply it to the world around us?
Now, the first question was answered in 1926
by a fellow named Oskar Klein.
He suggested that dimensions might come in two varieties --
there might be big, easy-to-see dimensions,
but there might also be tiny, curled-up dimensions,
curled up so small, even though they're all around us,
that we don't see them.
So, imagine you're looking at something
like a cable supporting a traffic light.
It's in Manhattan. You're in Central Park -- it's kind of irrelevant --
but the cable looks one-dimensional from a distant viewpoint,
but you and I all know that it does have some thickness.
It's very hard to see it, though, from far away.
But if we zoom in and take the perspective of, say,
a little ant walking around --
little ants are so small that they can access all of the dimensions --
the long dimension,
but also this clockwise, counter-clockwise direction.
And I hope you appreciate this.
It took so long to get these ants to do this.
big and small. And the idea that maybe the big dimensions around us
are the ones that we can easily see,
but there might be additional dimensions curled up,
sort of like the circular part of that cable,
so small that they have so far remained invisible.
Let me show you what that would look like.
So, if we take a look, say, at space itself --
I can only show, of course, two dimensions on a screen.
Some of you guys will fix that one day,
but anything that's not flat on a screen is a new dimension,
goes smaller, smaller, smaller,
and way down in the microscopic depths of space itself,
this is the idea,
you could have additional curled up dimensions --
But if you were a little ultra microscopic ant walking around,
you could walk in the big dimensions that we all know about --
that's like the grid part --
but you could also access the tiny curled-up dimension
that's so small that we can't see it with the naked eye
or even with any of our most refined equipment.
But deeply tucked into the fabric of space itself,
the idea is there could be more dimensions, as we see there.
Now that's an explanation
about how the universe could have more dimensions than the ones that we see.
But what about the second question that I asked:
does the theory actually work
when you try to apply it to the real world?
worked on trying to refine this framework
and apply it to the physics of the universe
as was understood at the time, and, in detail, it didn't work.
In detail, for instance,
they couldn't get the mass of the electron
to work out correctly in this theory.
So many people worked on it, but by the '40s, certainly by the '50s,
this strange but very compelling idea
of how to unify the laws of physics had gone away.
Until something wonderful happened in our age.
In our era, a new approach to unify the laws of physics
is being pursued by physicists such as myself,
many others around the world,
it's called superstring theory, as you were indicating.
And the wonderful thing is that superstring theory
has nothing to do at first sight with this idea of extra dimensions,
but when we study superstring theory,
we find that it resurrects the idea in a sparkling, new form.
Superstring theory -- what is it?
Well, it's a theory that tries to answer the question:
what are the basic, fundamental, indivisible, uncuttable constituents
making up everything in the world around us?
The idea is like this.
So, imagine we look at a familiar object, just a candle in a holder,
and imagine that we want to figure out what it is made of.
So we go on a journey deep inside the object and examine the constituents.
So deep inside -- we all know, you go sufficiently far down, you have atoms.
We also all know that atoms are not the end of the story.
They have little electrons that swarm around a central nucleus
with neutrons and protons.
Even the neutrons and protons have smaller particles inside of them known as quarks.
That is where conventional ideas stop.
Deep inside any of these particles, there is something else.
This something else is this dancing filament of energy.
It looks like a vibrating string --
that's where the idea, string theory comes from.
And just like the vibrating strings that you just saw in a cello
can vibrate in different patterns,
these can also vibrate in different patterns.
They don't produce different musical notes.
Rather, they produce the different particles making up the world around us.
So if these ideas are correct,
this is what the ultra-microscopic landscape of the universe looks like.
It's built up of a huge number
of these little tiny filaments of vibrating energy,
vibrating in different frequencies.
The different frequencies produce the different particles.
The different particles are responsible
for all the richness in the world around us.
because matter particles, electrons and quarks,
radiation particles, photons, gravitons, are all built up from one entity.
So matter and the forces of nature all are put together
under the rubric of vibrating strings.
And that's what we mean by a unified theory.
Now here is the catch.
When you study the mathematics of string theory,
you find that it doesn't work
in a universe that just has three dimensions of space.
It doesn't work in a universe with four dimensions of space, nor five, nor six.
Finally, you can study the equations, and show that it works
only in a universe that has 10 dimensions of space
and one dimension of time.
It leads us right back to this idea of Kaluza and Klein --
that our world, when appropriately described,
has more dimensions than the ones that we see.
OK, you know, if you have extra dimensions, and they're really tightly curled up,
yeah, perhaps we won't see them, if they're small enough.
But if there's a little tiny civilization of green people walking around down there,
and you make them small enough, and we won't see them either. That is true.
One of the other predictions of string theory --
no, that's not one of the other predictions of string theory.
are we just trying to hide away these extra dimensions,
or do they tell us something about the world?
In the remaining time, I'd like to tell you two features of them.
First is, many of us believe that these extra dimensions
hold the answer to what perhaps is the deepest question
in theoretical physics, theoretical science.
And that question is this: when we look around the world,
as scientists have done for the last hundred years,
there appear to be about 20 numbers that really describe our universe.
These are numbers like the mass of the particles,
like electrons and quarks, the strength of gravity,
the strength of the electromagnetic force --
a list of about 20 numbers
that have been measured with incredible precision,
but nobody has an explanation
for why the numbers have the particular values that they do.
Not yet.
But we believe the answer for why those numbers have the values they do
may rely on the form of the extra dimensions.
And the wonderful thing is, if those numbers
had any other values than the known ones,
the universe, as we know it, wouldn't exist.
This is a deep question.
Why are those numbers so finely tuned
to allow stars to shine and planets to form,
when we recognize that if you fiddle with those numbers --
if I had 20 dials up here
and I let you come up and fiddle with those numbers,
almost any fiddling makes the universe disappear.
So can we explain those 20 numbers?
And string theory suggests that those 20 numbers
have to do with the extra dimensions.
Let me show you how.
So when we talk about the extra dimensions in string theory,
it's not one extra dimension,
as in the older ideas of Kaluza and Klein.
This is what string theory says about the extra dimensions.
They have a very rich, intertwined geometry.
name isn't all that important.
But, as you can see,
the extra dimensions fold in on themselves
and intertwine in a very interesting shape, interesting structure.
And the idea is that if this is what the extra dimensions look like,
then the microscopic landscape of our universe all around us
would look like this on the tiniest of scales.
When you swing your hand,
you'd be moving around these extra dimensions over and over again,
but they're so small that we wouldn't know it.
So what is the physical implication, though, relevant to those 20 numbers?
notice that the vibrations of the airstreams
are affected by the shape of the instrument.
Now in string theory,
all the numbers are reflections of the way strings can vibrate.
So just as those airstreams
are affected by the twists and turns in the instrument,
strings themselves will be affected
by the vibrational patterns in the geometry within which they are moving.
So let me bring some strings into the story.
And if you watch these little fellows vibrating around --
they'll be there in a second -- right there,
notice that they way they vibrate is affected
by the geometry of the extra dimensions.
we don't yet, but if we did --
we should be able to calculate the allowed notes,
the allowed vibrational patterns.
And if we could calculate the allowed vibrational patterns,
we should be able to calculate those 20 numbers.
And if the answer that we get from our calculations
agrees with the values of those numbers
that have been determined
through detailed and precise experimentation,
this in many ways would be the first fundamental explanation
for why the structure of the universe is the way it is.
Now, the second issue that I want to finish up with is:
how might we test for these extra dimensions more directly?
Is this just an interesting mathematical structure
that might be able to explain
some previously unexplained features of the world,
or can we actually test for these extra dimensions?
And we think -- and this is, I think, very exciting --
that in the next five years or so we may be able to test
for the existence of these extra dimensions.
a machine is being built called the Large Hadron Collider.
It's a machine that will send particles around a tunnel,
opposite directions, near the speed of light.
Every so often those particles will be aimed at each other,
so there's a head-on collision.
The hope is that if the collision has enough energy,
it may eject some of the debris from the collision
from our dimensions, forcing it to enter into the other dimensions.
How would we know it?
Well, we'll measure the amount of energy after the collision,
compare it to the amount of energy before,
and if there's less energy after the collision than before,
this will be evidence that the energy has drifted away.
And if it drifts away in the right pattern that we can calculate,
this will be evidence that the extra dimensions are there.
So, imagine we have a certain kind of particle called a graviton --
that's the kind of debris we expect to be ejected out,
if the extra dimensions are real.
But here's how the experiment will go.
You take these particles. You slam them together.
You slam them together, and if we are right,
some of the energy of that collision
will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions.
So this is the kind of experiment
that we'll be looking at in the next five, seven to 10 years or so.
And if this experiment bears fruit,
if we see that kind of particle ejected
by noticing that there's less energy in our dimensions
than when we began,
this will show that the extra dimensions are real.
and a remarkable opportunity. Going back to Newton with absolute space --
didn't provide anything but an arena, a stage
in which the events of the universe take place.
Einstein comes along and says,
well, space and time can warp and curve -- that's what gravity is.
And now string theory comes along and says,
yes, gravity, quantum mechanics, electromagnetism,
all together in one package,
but only if the universe has more dimensions than the ones that we see.
And this is an experiment that may test for them in our lifetime.
Amazing possibility.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
And I feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me.
I feel it's sort of like the Vimalakirti Sutra,
an ancient work from ancient India
in which the Buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people
come to see him from the biggest city in the area, Vaishali,
and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him.
All the young people, actually, from the city.
The old fogeys don't come because they're mad at Buddha,
because when he came to their city he accepted --
he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him, from whoever it is,
and the local geisha, a movie-star sort of person,
raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first.
"He's supposed to be religious and all this.
What's he doing over there at Amrapali's house with all his 500 monks,"
and so on. They were all grumbling, and so they boycotted him.
They wouldn't go listen to him.
But the young people all came.
And they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol, and they put it on the ground.
And as soon as they had laid all these,
all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient India,
he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium,
the wonder of the universe. Everyone looked in that, and they saw in there
the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes.
with human life on it,
and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets.
So they don't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed
in the sky -- they don't just see sort of pieces of matter burning
or rocks or flames or gases exploding.
They actually see landscapes and human beings
and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that.
to get everyone to think about interconnection
and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected.
And then Leilei -- I know his other name -- told us about interconnection,
and how we're all totally interconnected here,
and how we've all known each other. And of course in the Buddhist universe,
we've already done this already billions of times in many, many lifetimes in the past.
And I didn't give the talk always. You did, and we had to watch you, and so forth.
And we're all still trying to, I guess we're all trying to become TEDsters,
if that's a modern form of enlightenment.
I guess so. Because in a way, if a TEDster relates to all the interconnectedness
of all the computers and everything, it's the forging of a mass awareness,
of where everybody can really know everything
that's going on everywhere in the planet.
what compassion is, is where it will become intolerable for us,
totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying
the life of the mind or whatever it is,
and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease
and they cannot have a bite of food and they have no place,
or they're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth.
It just becomes intolerable.
With all of us knowing everything, we're kind of forced by technology
to become Buddhas or something, to become enlightened.
Because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do,
a little bit tired, we do suffer.
We do enjoy our misery in a certain way.
We distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere,
but basically we all have this common misery
that we are sort of stuck inside our skins
and everyone else is out there.
And occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin
and the two of us enjoy each other, and each one tries to get out of their own,
and ultimately it fails of course, and then we're back into this thing.
is that all we are is what is inside our skin.
And it's inside and outside, self and other,
and other is all very different.
And everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception,
a little bit, right?
You know, someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that's OK because you're in a theater,
but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you,
you'd freak out.
What do they want from me? Like, who's that?
And so you wouldn't sit that close to another person
because of your notion that it's you versus the universe -- that's all Buddha discovered.
Because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone, each of us,
and everyone else is different,
then that puts us in an impossible situation, doesn't it?
Who is it who's going to get enough attention from the world?
Who's going to get enough out of the world?
Who's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings --
if you're different from all the other beings?
surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way:
through art, through meditation, through understanding, through knowledge actually,
knowing that you have no such boundary,
knowing your interconnectedness with other beings.
You can experience yourself as the other beings
when you see through the delusion of being separated from them.
When you do that, you're forced to feel what they feel.
Luckily, they say -- I still am not sure --
but luckily, they say that when you reach that point because some people have said
in the Buddhist literature, they say, "Oh who would really want to be compassionate?
How awful! I'm so miserable on my own. My head is aching.
My bones are aching. I go from birth to death. I'm never satisfied.
I never have enough, even if I'm a billionaire, I don't have enough.
I need a hundred billion." So I'm like that.
Imagine if I had to feel even a hundred other people's suffering.
It would be terrible.
When you're no longer locked in yourself,
and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge
of the nature of the world, that enables you to let your mind spread out,
and empathize, and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing,
and realizing that you are the other being,
somehow by that opening, you can see the deeper nature of life. And you can,
you get away from this terrible iron circle of I, me, me, mine,
like the Beatles used to sing.
Too bad nobody ever woke up to it,
and they've been trying to suppress it since then.
I, me, me, mine. It's like a perfect song, that song. A perfect teaching.
But when we're relieved from that,
we somehow then become interested in all the other beings.
And we feel ourselves differently. It's totally strange.
It's totally strange.
The Dalai Lama always likes to say --
he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion,
it's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures
are finally too small a theater for your intelligence.
It's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that, or what, you know --
and the more you focus on how you feel, by the way, the worse it gets.
Like, even when you're having a good time,
when is the good time over?
The good time is over when you think, how good is it?
And then it's never good enough.
on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time,
doing it by having a good time.
I think the Dalai Lama should have heard that. I wish he'd been there to hear that.
He once told me -- he looked kind of sad;
he worries very much about the haves and have-nots.
He looked a little sad, because he said, well, a hundred years ago,
they went and took everything away from the haves.
You know, the big communist revolutions, Russia and China and so forth.
They took it all away by violence,
saying they were going to give it to everyone, and then they were even worse.
They didn't help at all.
And so then he looks at me.
So I said, "Well, you know, you're all in this yourself. You teach: it's generosity,"
was all I could think of. What is virtue?
But of course, what you said, I think the key to saving the world, the key to compassion
is that it is more fun.
It should be done by fun. Generosity is more fun. That's the key.
Everybody has the wrong idea. They think Buddha was so boring,
and they're so surprised when they meet Dalai Lama and he's fairly jolly.
Even though his people are being genocided --
and believe me, he feels every blow on every old nun's head,
in every Chinese prison. He feels it.
He feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays.
I won't even say what they do. But he feels it.
And yet he's very jolly. He's extremely jolly.
then you can't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others' misery?
You have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is,
how it can be changed.
Look at that beautiful thing Chiho showed us. She scared us with the lava man.
She scared us with the lava man is coming,
then the tsunami is coming,
but then finally there were flowers and trees, and it was very beautiful.
It's really lovely.
and the human being actually is compassion.
The human being is almost out of time.
The human being is compassion because what is our brain for?
Now, Jim's brain is memorizing the almanac.
But he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is, he will, he did.
He could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings.
And he would have tremendous fun doing that.
when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of, how happy am I,
where you're always dissatisfied --
as Mick Jagger told us. You never get any satisfaction that way.
So then you decide, "Well, I'm sick of myself.
I'm going to think of how other people can be happy.
I'm going to get up in the morning and think,
what can I do for even one other person, even a dog, my dog, my cat,
my pet, my butterfly?"
And the first person who gets happy when you do that,
you don't do anything for anybody else, but you get happier, you yourself,
because your whole perception broadens
and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it.
And you realize that this -- being with these people --
is the flower garden that Chiho showed us.
It is Nirvana.
And my time is up. And I know the TED commandments.
Thank you.
I'm just going to play a brief video clip.
On the fifth of December 1985, a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold
for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record.
The buyer
was Kip Forbes,
son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century.
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be
one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century.
Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world,
the prince of any wine cellar.
that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world.
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock.
In 1985, he announced to his friends in the wine world
that he had made this incredible discovery.
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall,
and happened upon this hidden cache of wines --
apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson. 1787, 1784.
He wouldn't reveal the exact number of bottles,
he would not reveal exactly where the building was
and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building.
The mystery persisted for about 20 years.
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles,
and he became suspicious.
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI
and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this.
There's now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man,
and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes.
an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures
in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles.
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine
in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world,
must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world.
I became increasingly, kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of
you know, why do people spend these crazy amounts of money,
not only on wine but on lots of things,
and are they living a better life than me?
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes,
I decided to sample the very best, or most expensive, or most coveted item
in about a dozen categories,
which was a very grueling quest, as you can imagine.
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing.
It may come from Wagyu cattle,
but it's not from the original, Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan.
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe,
and one of them is Wolfgang Puck's restaurant, Cut, in Los Angeles.
I went there, and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars.
And it arrived, and it was tiny.
And I was outraged.
It was like, 160 dollars for this?
And then I took a bite,
and I wished that it was tinier, because Kobe beef is so rich.
It's like foie gras -- it's not even like steak.
I almost couldn't finish it.
I was really happy when I was done.
for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them,
so that's why you're going to see this recurring character.
Which, I guess, you know, communicates to you
that I did not think that one was really worth the price.
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world.
To try this, I went to a Mario Batali restaurant
in Manhattan -- Del Posto.
The waiter, you know, came out with the white truffle knob
and his shaver, and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said, you know,
"Would Signore like the truffles?"
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma.
It's not in their taste, really. It's not in their texture.
It's in the smell.
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles,
this haunting, wonderful, nutty, mushroomy smell wafted up.
10 seconds passed and it was gone.
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that,
you know, their purpose had been served,
and so I'm afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me.
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments.
The magazine wouldn't pay for me to go there.
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet.
It has 360-degree views.
It has four balconies.
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei.
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver.
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from.
When I took the tour, it actually included some Opus One, I was glad to see.
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel.
which have antibacterial properties.
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this.
And it, you know, tickled a little bit and it smelled good,
but I have to say that nobody here
has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today.
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you,
not only did I not get a compliment from any of you,
I have not gotten a compliment from anybody
in the months that I have owned and worn these.
I don't think that whether or not you're getting a compliment
should be the test of something's value,
but I think in the case of a fashion item, an article of clothing,
that's a reasonable benchmark.
That said, a lot of work goes into these.
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton
that has been shuttle loomed
and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times.
But no compliments.
from an olive that grows on a single slope in Tuscany.
And he goes to great lengths to protect the olive oil from oxygen and light.
He uses tiny bottles, the glass is tinted,
he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas.
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it,
he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online,
so you can go online and look at your batch number
and see how the phenolics are developing,
and, you know, gauge its freshness.
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils.
It tasted fine. It tasted interesting.
It was very green, it was very peppery.
But in the blind taste test, it came in last.
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of
Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove
for six months.
you'll start to notice.
but I did interview a guy who owns them.
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean, they'll say
these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed
and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they'll say, look, you know,
you're not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs.
You're paying for the bling,
that they're encrusted with gold and platinum.
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say
that he's gotten a lot of pleasure out of them, so ...
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process.
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet.
It's a cat that lives in trees,
and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations.
And apparently it's a very picky eater and it, you know,
hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries.
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans,
and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats' leavings
then go through the forest collecting the, you know, results
and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it
in the unprocessed form.
That's right.
There's one with a fragrance dispenser.
There's one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl
and transmits the results via email to your doctor.
It's almost like a home medical center --
and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in.
This one does not have those bells and whistles,
but for pure functionality it's pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600.
And to try this -- I couldn't get a loaner,
but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer, Toto,
and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use, which I used.
It's fully automated -- you walk towards it, and the seat lifts.
The seat is preheated.
There's a water jet that cleans you.
There's an air jet that dries you.
You get up, it flushes by itself.
The lid closes, it self-cleans.
Not only is it a technological leap forward,
but I really do believe it's a bit of a cultural leap forward.
I mean, a no hands, no toilet paper toilet.
And I want to get one of these.
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed.
There's a little plaque on the end that, you know,
each buyer gets their name engraved on it.
spend the night in the Manhattan showroom.
Lights glaring in off the street,
and we had to hire a security guard and all these things.
But anyway, we had a great night's sleep.
And you spend a third of your life in bed.
I don't think it's that bad of a deal.
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world
and the most expensive production car.
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company,
a professional race car driver,
and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles
and down on the Pacific Coast Highway.
And, you know, when we pulled up to a stoplight
the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods.
And it was really amazing.
It was such a smooth ride.
Most of the cars that I drive, if I get up to 80 they start to rattle.
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver, this chaperone, said,
"You know, you were just going 110 miles an hour."
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people
you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic,
because it was just that smooth.
And if I was a billionaire, I would get one.
of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology.
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the "Mission: Impossible III" premiere.
When he tries to open the door,
you could call it "Mission: Impossible IV."
and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc.
The '47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century.
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux
in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape.
And 1947 was a legendary vintage,
especially in the right bank of Bordeaux.
And just together, that vintage and that chateau took on this aura
that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following.
But it's 60 years old.
There's not much of it left.
What there is of it left you don't know if it's real --
it's considered to be the most faked wine in the world.
Not that many people are looking to pop open
their one remaining bottle for a journalist.
I'd put out feelers to retailers, to auctioneers,
and it was coming up empty.
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai.
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist
who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings,
and he said, "I've got a tasting coming up
where we're going to serve the '47 Cheval Blanc."
And it was going to be a double vertical --
it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc,
and 30 vintages of Yquem.
And it was an invitation you do not refuse.
I went.
And at lunch on Saturday, we opened the '47.
And you know, it had this fragrant softness,
and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil.
And then I tasted it, and it,
you know, had this kind of unctuous, porty richness,
which is characteristic of that wine --
that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways.
There were people at my table who thought it was, you know, fantastic.
There were some people who were a little less impressed.
And I wasn't that impressed.
And I don't -- call my palate a philistine palate --
so it doesn't necessarily mean something that I wasn't impressed,
but I was not the only one there who had that reaction.
And it wasn't just to that wine.
Any one of the wines served at this tasting,
if I'd been served it at a dinner party, it would have been, you know,
the wine experience of my lifetime, and incredibly memorable.
But drinking 60 great wines over three days,
they all just blurred together,
and it became almost a grueling experience.
which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech.
And they gave subjects the same wine,
labeled with different price tags.
A lot of people, you know,
said that they liked the more expensive wine more --
it was the same wine, but they thought it was a different one
that was more expensive.
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did
MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine,
and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more --
their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure
from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag.
Video: Narrator: An event seen from one point of view
gives one impression.
Seen from another point of view, it gives quite a different impression.
But it's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand
what's going on.
And I found that in 29 seconds, it tells more about
the power of, and importance of, independent media
than I could say in an hour.
So I thought that it will be good to start with it.
And also start with a little bit of statistics.
According to relevant researchers, 83 percent of the population of this planet
lives in the societies without independent press.
Think about that number: 83 percent of the population on the whole planet
does not really know what is going on in their countries.
The information they get gets filtered through somebody
who either twists that information, or colors that information,
does something with it.
So they're deprived of understanding their reality.
That is just to understand how big and important this problem is.
Now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies
that represent 17 percent, I think should enjoy it until it lasts.
You know, Sunday morning, you flick the paper, get your cappuccino.
Enjoy it while it lasts.
Because as we heard yesterday, countries can lose stars from their flags,
but they can also lose press freedom,
as I guess Americans among us can tell us more about.
But that's totally another and separate topic.
So I can go back to my story.
At that time I was running B92, the only independent,
for that matter the only electronic media, in the country.
And I guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only
independent media in the country, operating in hostile environment,
where government really wants to make your life miserable.
And there are different ways.
Yeah, it was the usual cocktail:
a little bit of threats, a little bit of friendly advice,
a little bit of financial police, a little bit of text control,
so you always have somebody who never leaves your office.
But what they really do, which is very powerful,
you know, they threaten your advertisers.
Once they threaten your advertisers, market forces are actually,
you know, destroyed, and the advertisers do not want to come --
no matter how much does it make sense for them --
do not want to come and advertise.
And you have a problem making ends meet.
which was, you know, survival below one side,
but what was really painful for me was,
remember, the beginning of the '90s, Yugoslavia is falling apart.
We were sitting over there with a country in a downfall,
in a slow-motion downfall.
And we all had all of that on tapes.
We had the ability to understand what was going on.
We were actually recording history.
The problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later;
because if we did not, we could not afford enough tapes
to keep archives of that history.
So if I gave you that picture, I don't want to go too long on that.
In that context a gentleman came to my office at that time.
It was still 1991.
He was running a media systems organization
which is still in business, the gentleman is still in business.
And what did I know at that time about media systems?
I would think media systems were organizations,
which means they should help you.
So I prepared two plans for that meeting, two strategic plans:
the small one and the big one.
The small one was, I just wanted him
to help us get those damn tapes,
so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years.
The big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan.
Because I thought, I still maintain,
that serious and independent media companies are great business.
And I thought that B92 will survive and be a great company
once Milosevic is gone, which turned out to be true.
It's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest
media company in the country.
And I thought that the only thing that we needed at that time
was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times.
great suit and tie.
I gave him what I thought was a brilliant explanation
of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult
the war will be.
Actually, I underestimated the atrocities, I have to admit.
Anyway, after that whole, big, long explanation,
the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke --
is, are we paying royalties after we broadcast music
of Michael Jackson?
That was really the only question he had.
He left, and I remember being actually very angry at myself
because I thought there must be an institution in the world
that is providing loans to media companies.
Somebody must have started something like that.
you could not just Google in '91.
So I thought that that's actually my problem.
Now we go from here, fast forward to 1995.
trying for the third time to convince him that
his foundation should invest in something that should
operate like a media bank.
Forget about handouts; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody.
What you should do is you should treat media companies as a business.
It's business anywhere.
Media business, or any other business, it needs to be capitalized.
And what these guys need, actually, is access to capital.
So third meeting, arguments are pretty well exercised.
At the end of the meeting he says,
look, it is not going to work; you will never see your money back;
but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea.
See that it will not work.
He said, I'll give you a rope to hang yourself.
(Laughter)
I knew two things after that meeting.
First, under no circumstances I want to hang myself.
And second, that I have no idea how to make it work.
You see, at the level of a concept, it was a great concept.
But it's one thing to have a concept;
it's a totally separate thing to actually make it work.
Had the wrong idea; I thought that we can be a bank.
You see banks -- I don't know if there are any bankers over here;
I apologize in advance -- but it's the best job in the world.
You know, you find somebody who is respectable
and has a lot of money.
You give them more money; they repay you that over a time.
You collect interest and do nothing in between.
So I thought, why don't we get into that business?
(Laughter)
So here we are having our first client, brilliant.
First independent newspaper in Slovakia.
The government cutting them off
from all the printing facilities in Bratislava.
So here's the daily newspaper
that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital.
It's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m.
That means that they have no sports;
they have no latest news; circulation goes down.
It's a kind of very nice, sophisticated way
how to economically strangle a daily newspaper.
They come to us with a request for a loan.
They want to -- the only way for them to survive
is to get a printing press.
And we said, that's fine; let's meet;
you'll bring us your business plan, which eventually they did.
I get these two pieces of paper, not like this, A4 format,
so it's much bigger.
A lot of numbers there. A lot of numbers.
But however you put it, you know, the numbers
do not make any sense.
go into these companies and earn our return
by fixing them -- by establishing management systems,
average interest rate five percent to six percent.
Lately we are going wild, charging seven percent from time to time.
We do it in 17 countries of the developing world.
And here is the most stunning number.
Return rate -- the one that Soros was so worried about -- 97 percent.
97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time.
What do we typically finance?
We finance anything that a media company would need,
from printing presses to transmitters.
What is most important is we do it
either in form of loans, equities, lease --
whatever is appropriate for, you know, supporting anybody.
But what is most important here is, who do we finance?
We believe that in the last 10 years companies
that we've financed are actually the best media companies
in the developing world.
That is a "Who is Who" list.
And I could spend hours talking about them,
because they're all kind of heroes.
And I can, but I'll give you just, maybe one,
Our first loan in Russia was in Chelyabinsk.
I'll bet half of you have never heard of that place.
In the south of Russia there's a guy called
Boris Nikolayevich Kirshin, who is running
an independent newspaper there.
The city was closed until early '90s
because, of all things, they were producing glass for Tupolev planes.
Anyway, he's running independent newspaper there.
After two years working with us, he becomes
the most respected newspaper in that small place.
Governor comes to him one day,
actually invites him to come to his office.
He goes and sees the governor. The governor says,
Boris Nikolayevich, I understand you are doing a great job,
and you are the most respected newspaper in our district.
And I want to offer you a deal.
Can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months,
because I have elections --
there are elections coming up in nine months.
I will not run, but it's very important for me
who is going to succeed me.
How much would that cost?
Boris Nikolayevich says, "It's not for sale."
The governor says, "We will close you."
Luckily, we had enough time to help Boris Nikolayevich
take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one,
to get all the subscription lists, rehire staff.
So what the governor got was an empty shell.
But that is what happens if you're in business of independent media,
We started our media lab, sounds like a real great story.
But there is a second angle to that.
The second angle, like in this clip.
If you take the camera above, you start thinking
That is not too much, is it?
It's actually just a drop in the sea.
Because when you think about the importance,
some of the issues that we were talking about last night --
this last session we had about Africa and his
hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for Africa.
All of those, not all, half of those problems mentioned last night --
government accountability, corruption, how do you fight corruption,
giving voice to unheard, to poor --
it's why independent media is in business.
And it's why it was invented.
So from that perspective, what we did is just really
one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify.
Now ours is just one story.
of nonprofits doing spectacular work.
Here is where the problem is,
and I'll explain to you as well as I can what the problem is.
And it's called fundraising.
Imagine that this third of this room is filled
with people who represent different foundations.
Imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations,
doing very important work.
Now imagine that every second person over here
is deaf, does not hear, and switch the lights off.
Now that is how difficult it is to match people
from this side of the room
with people of that side of the room.
So we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed
to reform, to totally rethink fundraising.
You know, instead of people running in this dark,
trying to find their own match, who will be willing,
who has the same goals.
Instead of all of that we thought there is --
something new needs to be invented.
And we came up with this idea of issuing bonds,
U.S. government budget deficit,
why wouldn't we find investors willing to finance
press freedom deficit?
find enough investors that this can be considered a success,
there's nothing stopping the next organization
to start to issue bonds next spring.
And those can be environmental bonds.
And then two weeks later, Iqbal Quadir can issue his
electricity in Bangladesh bonds.
And before you know it, any social cause
can be actually financed in this way.
But let's take the idea further.
You do it, you start it in the States, because it's,
you know, concepts are very, very close to American minds.
But you can actually bring it to Europe, too.
You can bring it to Asia.
You can, once you have all of those different points,
you can make it easy for investors.
Put all of those bonds at one place
and they sit down and click.
Once you have more than 10 of them
you have to develop some kind of a matrix.
What do investors get?
On one side financial, on the other side social.
So that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency,
Morningstar type.
It says, you know, social impact over here is spectacular, five stars.
Financial, they give you one percent, only one star.
Now take it to the last step.
Once you have all of that put together,
there's not one reason why you couldn't actually have
a marketplace for all of that,
where you cannot dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way.
And in that way you organize the financing
so there are no dark rooms, no blind people
running around to find each other.
Well, as Alexander Graham Bell famously said
on his first successful telephone call,
(Laughter)
I just really want to thank you very much.
"What a strange, long trip it's about to become."
At this very moment, you are viewing my upper half.
(Laughter)
in a different country.
You can, it turns out, be in two places at once.
But still, I'm sorry I can't be with you in person.
I'll explain at another time.
The revolution -- this revolution -- is much bigger than that.
I hope, I believe.
What turns me on about the digital age,
what excites me personally,
is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing.
You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song,
you needed a studio and a producer.
Now, you need a laptop.
Now, you need a camera that fits in your palm,
and a couple of bucks for a blank DVD.
Imagination has been decoupled from the old constraints.
And that really, really excites me.
I'm excited when I glimpse that kind of thinking writ large.
The geopolitical world has got a lot to learn from the digital world.
From the ease with which you swept away obstacles
that no one knew could even be budged.
or, "Do They Know It's Christmas?"
Band Aid, Live Aid.
It was a great moment, and it utterly changed my life.
The children had a name for me.
They called me, "The girl with the beard."
Anyway, we found Africa to be a magical place.
Big skies, big hearts, big, shining continent.
Anyway, on our last day at this orphanage
Six-and-a-half thousand Africans dying every single day from AIDS --
will catch HIV because of stigmatization and lack of education.
The right to live, period.
Because this is not all about charity.
This is about justice. Really.
And that's too bad, because we're very good at charity.
Americans, like Irish people, are good at it.
Even the poorest neighborhoods give more than they can afford.
We like to give, and we give a lot.
It makes a farce of our idea of equality.
It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern.
It questions our commitment.
Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa,
And deep down, if we really accepted that Africans were equal to us,
we would all do more to put the fire out.
when what we really need is the fire brigade.
Does stuff have to look like an action movie these days
to exist in the front of our brain?
The slow extinguishing of countless lives
Catastrophes that we can avert
are not as interesting as ones we could avert.
Anyway, I believe that that kind of thinking
that we in Europe, or you in America,
are not treating it like an emergency --
I want to argue that though Africa is not the front line in the war against terror,
it could be soon.
Every week, religious extremists take another African village.
In turbulent times, isn't it cheaper, and smarter,
to make friends out of potential enemies
than to defend yourself against them later?
"The war against terror is bound up in the war against poverty."
And I didn't say that. Colin Powell said that.
Now when the military are telling us that this is a war
There's an opportunity here, and it's real.
The problems facing the developing world
We will not only transform other people's lives,
but we will also transform the way those other lives see us.
that anti-retroviral drugs are great advertisements
for Western ingenuity and technology?
Doesn't compassion look well on us?
And let's cut the crap for a second.
Someone's put a brick through the window.
The regional branch managers are getting nervous.
Our values: do we have any?
Our credibility?
And I say that as a fan, you know?
But that's just the easy part, or ought to be.
You see, the scale of the suffering numbs us into a kind of indifference.
What on earth can we all do about this?
It is not a theory.
The fact is that ours is the first generation
that can look disease and extreme poverty in the eye,
look across the ocean to Africa, and say this, and mean it:
we do not have to stand for this.
A whole continent written off -- we do not have to stand for this.
before I back it up to a bunch of ex-hippies.
I can't; you can't, as individuals; but we can change the world.
But working together, we can actually change the world.
It is the flowering of the seeds you planted
This is what excites me.
This room was born for this moment,
is really what I want to say to you tonight.
Most of you started out wanting to change the world, didn't you?
Most of you did, the digital world.
Well, now, actually because of you,
it is possible to change the physical world.
It's a fact.
Economists confirm it, and they know much more than I do.
So why, then, are we not pumping our fists into the air?
Probably because when we admit we can do something about it,
we have the know-how; we have the cash;
I do not have flowers in my hair.
Actually, I come from punk rock.
But idealism allied with pragmatism,
It's based on our belief that the action of one person
can change a lot,
but the actions of many coming together as one
We believe this is one.
We believe that this could be the time when the world finally decides
This could be the time that we finally get serious
Lurching a little, but it's building.
This year is a test for us all,
I have been, of late, disappointed with the Bush Administration.
They started out with such promise on Africa.
They made some really great promises,
and actually have fulfilled a lot of them.
They don't feel the push from the ground, is the truth.
and the fiscal well being of their country.
if we got organized.
is that aid for Africa is just great value for money
at a time when America really needs it.
Putting it in the crassest possible terms,
Because we also need your intellectual capital:
Some of the technologies we've been talking about, you invented them,
And we'd like you to give us that energy.
Give us that kind of dreaming, that kind of doing.
People are starting to figure this out.
Movements are springing up.
When the history books get written,
I think our age will be remembered for three things.
Really, it's just three things this whole age will be remembered for.
The digital revolution, yes.
And what we did or did not do to put out the fires in Africa.
You see, if this is true, and I believe it is,
the creative imagination from the physical constraints of matter,
A few minutes ago, I talked about all the citizens' campaigns that are springing up.
We know there's more than enough energy to power this movement.
Pepsi America, nerd America, noisy America.
We can't afford to be cool and sit this one out.
the course of history, literally, for the continent of Africa.
Anyway, so I'd like your help in getting that signed up.
I know John Gage and Sun Microsystems are already on board for this,
but there's lots of you we'd like to talk to.
That's one billion media hits.
Could be on Google, could be on AOL.
It could be NBC. It could be ABC.
Actually we're talking to ABC today about the Oscars.
But you know, we want, we need some airtime for our ideas.
We need to get the math; we need to get the statistics out to the American people.
I really believe that old Truman line,
that if you give the American people the facts,
they'll do the right thing.
This has to be described as an adventure, not a burden.
Every three seconds one person dies.
Another three seconds, one more.
The situation is so desperate in parts of Africa,
Asia, even America,
that aid groups, just as they did for the tsunami,
are uniting as one, acting as one.
We can beat extreme poverty, starvation, AIDS.
But we need your help.
One more person, letter, voice
will mean the difference between life and death
Please join us by working together.
Americans have an unprecedented opportunity.
And I would like it to be Ethiopia.
we can connect to the Internet.
That is my wish, my third wish.
I think it's possible.
I think we have the money and brains in the room to do that.
I've been to Ethiopia, as I said earlier.
The idea that the Internet, which changed all of our lives,
can transform a country -- and a continent
It was just nine years later that Addis Ababa
The average waiting time to get a landline in Ethiopia
Anyway, I'm Irish, and as you can see,
I know how important talking is.
What I'd like to talk about is really the biggest problems in the world.
I'm not going to talk about "The Skeptical Environmentalist" --
probably that's also a good choice.
(Laughter)
And I must say, before I go on, I should ask every one of you
to try and get out pen and paper
because I'm actually going to ask you to help me to look at how we do that.
So get out your pen and paper.
Bottom line is, there is a lot of problems out there in the world.
I'm just going to list some of them.
There are 800 million people starving.
There's a billion people without clean drinking water.
Two billion people without sanitation.
There are several million people dying of HIV and AIDS.
The lists go on and on.
There's two billions of people who will be severely affected by climate change -- so on.
There are many, many problems out there.
We don't actually solve all problems.
And if we do not, the question I think we need to ask ourselves --
and that's why it's on the economy session -- is to say,
if we don't do all things, we really have to start asking ourselves,
which ones should we solve first?
And that's the question I'd like to ask you.
If we had say, 50 billion dollars over the next four years to spend
to do good in this world, where should we spend it?
We identified 10 of the biggest challenges in the world,
and I will just briefly read them:
climate change, communicable diseases, conflicts, education,
financial instability, governance and corruption,
malnutrition and hunger, population migration,
sanitation and water, and subsidies and trade barriers.
We believe that these in many ways
encompass the biggest problems in the world.
The obvious question would be to ask,
what do you think are the biggest things?
Where should we start on solving these problems?
But that's a wrong problem to ask.
That was actually the problem that was asked in Davos in January.
Because we can't solve problems.
Surely the biggest problem we have in the world is that we all die.
But we don't have a technology to solve that, right?
So the point is not to prioritize problems,
but the point is to prioritize solutions to problems.
And that would be -- of course that gets a little more complicated.
To climate change that would be like Kyoto.
To communicable diseases, it might be health clinics or mosquito nets.
To conflicts, it would be U.N.'s peacekeeping forces, and so on.
The point that I would like to ask you to try to do,
is just in 30 seconds -- and I know this is in a sense
an impossible task -- write down what you think
is probably some of the top priorities.
And also -- and that's, of course, where economics gets evil --
to put down what are the things we should not do, first.
What should be at the bottom of the list?
Please, just take 30 seconds, perhaps talk to your neighbor,
and just figure out what should be the top priorities
and the bottom priorities of the solutions that we have
to the world's biggest issues.
I would love to -- I only have 18 minutes,
I've already given you quite a substantial amount of my time, right?
I'd love to go into, and get you to think about this process,
and that's actually what we did.
And I also strongly encourage you,
and I'm sure we'll also have these discussions afterwards,
to think about, how do we actually prioritize?
Of course, you have to ask yourself,
why on Earth was such a list never done before?
And one reason is that prioritization is incredibly uncomfortable.
Nobody wants to do this.
Of course, every organization would love to be on the top of such a list.
But every organization would also hate to be not on the top of the list.
And since there are many more not-number-one spots on the list
than there is number ones, it makes perfect sense
not to want to do such a list.
We've had the U.N. for almost 60 years,
yet we've never actually made a fundamental list
of all the big things that we can do in the world,
and said, which of them should we do first?
So it doesn't mean that we are not prioritizing --
any decision is a prioritization, so of course we are still prioritizing,
if only implicitly -- and that's unlikely to be as good
as if we actually did the prioritization,
and went in and talked about it.
for a very long time, had a situation when we've had a menu of choices.
There are many, many things we can do out there,
but we've not had the prices, nor the sizes.
We have not had an idea.
Imagine going into a restaurant and getting this big menu card,
but you have no idea what the price is.
You know, you have a pizza; you've no idea what the price is.
It could be at one dollar; it could be 1,000 dollars.
It could be a family-size pizza;
it could be a very individual-size pizza, right?
We'd like to know these things.
to try to put prices on these issues.
And so basically, this has been the Copenhagen Consensus' process.
We got 30 of the world's best economists, three in each area.
So we have three of world's top economists write about climate change.
What can we do? What will be the cost
and what will be the benefit of that?
Likewise in communicable diseases.
Three of the world's top experts saying, what can we do?
What would be the price?
What should we do about it, and what will be the outcome?
And so on.
eight of the world's top economists, including three Nobel Laureates,
meet in Copenhagen in May 2004.
We called them the "dream team."
The Cambridge University prefects decided to call them
the Real Madrid of economics.
That works very well in Europe, but it doesn't really work over here.
And what they basically did was come out with a prioritized list.
And then you ask, why economists?
And of course, I'm very happy you asked that question -- (Laughter) --
because that's a very good question.
The point is, of course, if you want to know about malaria,
you ask a malaria expert.
If you want to know about climate, you ask a climatologist.
But if you want to know which of the two you should deal with first,
you can't ask either of them, because that's not what they do.
That is what economists do.
They prioritize.
They make that in some ways disgusting task of saying, which one should we do first,
and which one should we do afterwards?
Of course, you can also see it on the website,
and we'll also talk about it more, I'm sure, as the day goes on.
They basically came up with a list where they said
there were bad projects -- basically, projects
where if you invest a dollar, you get less than a dollar back.
Then there's fair projects, good projects and very good projects.
And of course, it's the very good projects we should start doing.
I'm going to go from backwards
so that we end up with the best projects.
As you might see the bottom of the list was climate change.
This offends a lot of people, and that's probably one of the things
where people will say I shouldn't come back, either.
And I'd like to talk about that, because that's really curious.
Why is it it came up?
And I'll actually also try to get back to this
because it's probably one of the things
that we'll disagree with on the list that you wrote down.
or doing something more than Kyoto -- is a bad deal
is simply because it's very inefficient.
It's not saying that global warming is not happening.
It's not saying that it's not a big problem.
But it's saying that what we can do about it
is very little, at a very high cost.
What they basically show us, the average of all macroeconomic models,
is that Kyoto, if everyone agreed, would cost about 150 billion dollars a year.
That's a substantial amount of money.
That's two to three times the global development aid
that we give the Third World every year.
Yet it would do very little good.
All models show it will postpone warming for about six years in 2100.
So the guy in Bangladesh who gets a flood in 2100 can wait until 2106.
Which is a little good, but not very much good.
So the idea here really is to say, well, we've spent a lot of money doing a little good.
the U.N. actually estimate that for half that amount,
for about 75 billion dollars a year,
we could solve all major basic problems in the world.
We could give clean drinking water, sanitation, basic healthcare
and education to every single human being on the planet.
So we have to ask ourselves, do we want to spend twice the amount
on doing very little good?
Or half the amount on doing an amazing amount of good?
And that is really why it becomes a bad project.
It's not to say that if we had all the money in the world, we wouldn't want to do it.
But it's to say, when we don't, it's just simply not our first priority.
but communicable diseases, scale of basic health services -- just made it,
simply because, yes, scale of basic health services is a great thing.
It would do a lot of good, but it's also very, very costly.
Again, what it tells us is suddenly
we start thinking about both sides of the equation.
If you look at the good projects, a lot of sanitation and water projects came in.
Again, sanitation and water is incredibly important,
but it also costs a lot of infrastructure.
So I'd like to show you the top four priorities
which should be at least the first ones that we deal with
when we talk about how we should deal with the problems in the world.
The incidence of malaria is about a couple of [million] people get infected every year.
It might even cost up towards a percentage point of GDP
every year for affected nations.
If we invested about 13 billion dollars over the next four years,
we could bring that incidence down to half.
We could avoid about 500,000 people dying,
but perhaps more importantly, we could avoid about a [million] people
getting infected every year.
We would significantly increase their ability
to deal with many of the other problems that they have to deal with --
of course, in the long run, also to deal with global warming.
Basically, the model showed that if we could get free trade,
and especially cut subsidies in the U.S. and Europe,
we could basically enliven the global economy
to an astounding number of about 2,400 billion dollars a year,
half of which would accrue to the Third World.
Again, the point is to say that we could actually pull
two to three hundred million people out of poverty,
very radically fast, in about two to five years.
That would be the third best thing we could do.
Not just malnutrition in general, but there's a very cheap way
of dealing with malnutrition, namely, the lack of micronutrients.
Basically, about half of the world's population is lacking in
iron, zinc, iodine and vitamin A.
If we invest about 12 billion dollars,
we could make a severe inroad into that problem.
That would be the second best investment that we could do.
Basically, if we invest 27 billion dollars over the next eight years,
we could avoid 28 new million cases of HIV/AIDS.
Again, what this does and what it focuses on is saying
there are two very different ways that we can deal with HIV/AIDS.
One is treatment; the other one is prevention.
And again, in an ideal world, we would do both.
But in a world where we don't do either, or don't do it very well,
we have to at least ask ourselves where should we invest first.
And treatment is much, much more expensive than prevention.
So basically, what this focuses on is saying, we can do a lot more
by investing in prevention.
Basically for the amount of money that we spend,
we can do X amount of good in treatment,
and 10 times as much good in prevention.
So again, what we focus on is prevention rather than treatment,
at first rate.
I'd like to have you look at your priority list and say,
did you get it right?
Or did you get close to what we came up with here?
Well, of course, one of the things is climate change again.
I find a lot of people find it very, very unlikely that we should do that.
if for no other reason, simply because it's such a big problem.
But of course, we don't do all problems.
There are many problems out there in the world.
And what I want to make sure of is, if we actually focus on problems,
that we focus on the right ones.
The ones where we can do a lot of good rather than a little good.
And I think, actually -- Thomas Schelling,
one of the participants in the dream team, he put it very, very well.
One of things that people forget, is that in 100 years,
when we're talking about most of the climate change impacts will be,
people will be much, much richer.
Even the most pessimistic impact scenarios of the U.N.
estimate that the average person in the developing world in 2100
will be about as rich as we are today.
Much more likely, they will be two to four times richer than we are.
And of course, we'll be even richer than that.
or helping people in Bangladesh in 2100,
we're not talking about a poor Bangladeshi.
We're actually talking about a fairly rich Dutch guy.
And so the real point, of course, is to say,
do we want to spend a lot of money helping a little,
100 years from now, a fairly rich Dutch guy?
Or do we want to help real poor people, right now, in Bangladesh,
who really need the help, and whom we can help very, very cheaply?
Or as Schelling put it, imagine if you were a rich -- as you will be --
a rich Chinese, a rich Bolivian, a rich Congolese, in 2100,
thinking back on 2005, and saying, "How odd that they cared so much
about helping me a little bit through climate change,
and cared so fairly little about helping my grandfather
and my great grandfather, whom they could have helped so much more,
and who needed the help so much more?"
we need to get our priorities straight.
Even if it doesn't accord to the typical way we see this problem.
Of course, that's mainly because climate change has good pictures.
We have, you know, "The Day After Tomorrow" -- it looks great, right?
It's a good film in the sense that
I certainly want to see it, right, but don't expect Emmerich
to cast Brad Pitt in his next movie
digging latrines in Tanzania or something. (Laughter)
It just doesn't make for as much of a movie.
So in many ways, I think of the Copenhagen Consensus
and the whole discussion of priorities
as a defense for boring problems.
To make sure that we realize it's not about making us feel good.
It's not about making things that have the most media attention,
but it's about making places where we can actually do the most good.
is that I'm somehow -- or we are somehow -- positing a false choice.
Of course, we should do all things,
in an ideal world -- I would certainly agree.
I think we should do all things, but we don't.
In 1970, the developed world decided we were going to spend
twice as much as we did, right now, than in 1970, on the developing world.
Since then our aid has halved.
So it doesn't look like we're actually on the path
of suddenly solving all big problems.
You know, we spend 100 billion dollars --
why don't we spend that on doing good in the world?
I'm all for that.
If any one of you guys can talk Bush into doing that, that's fine.
But the point, of course, is still to say,
if you get another 100 billion dollars,
we still want to spend that in the best possible way, don't we?
So the real issue here is to get ourselves back
and think about what are the right priorities.
I should just mention briefly, is this really the right list that we got out?
You know, when you ask the world's best economists,
you inevitably end up asking old, white American men.
And they're not necessarily, you know,
great ways of looking at the entire world.
to come and solve the same problem.
The only two requirements were that they were studying at the university,
and they spoke English.
The majority of them were, first, from developing countries.
They had all the same material but they could go vastly
outside the scope of discussion, and they certainly did,
to come up with their own lists.
And the surprising thing was that the list was very similar --
with malnutrition and diseases at the top
and climate change at the bottom.
We've done this many other times.
There's been many other seminars and university students, and different things.
They all come out with very much the same list.
And that gives me great hope, really, in saying that I do believe
that there is a path ahead to get us to start thinking about priorities,
and saying, what is the important thing in the world?
Of course, in an ideal world, again we'd love to do everything.
But if we don't do it, then we can start thinking about where should we start?
We did it in 2004,
and we hope to assemble many more people,
getting much better information for 2008, 2012.
Map out the right path for the world --
but also to start thinking about political triage.
To start thinking about saying, "Let's do
not the things where we can do very little at a very high cost,
not the things that we don't know how to do,
but let's do the great things where we can do an enormous
amount of good, at very low cost, right now."
with the discussion of how we actually prioritize these,
but we have to be honest and frank about saying,
if there's some things we do, there are other things we don't do.
If we worry too much about some things,
we end by not worrying about other things.
So I hope this will help us make better priorities,
and think about how we better work for the world.
Thank you.
This is me. My name is Ben Saunders.
I specialize in dragging heavy things
around cold places.
I stood alone at the North geographic Pole.
I was the only human being in an area
one-and-a-half times the size of America,
five-and-a-half thousand square miles.
More than 2,000 people have climbed Everest.
12 people have stood on the moon.
Including me, only four people
have skied solo to the North Pole.
And I think the reason for that --
(Applause)
-- thank you -- I think the reason for that is that it's -- it's --
well, it's as Chris said, bonkers.
It's a journey that is right at the limit
of human capability.
I skied the equivalent of 31 marathons
back to back. 800 miles in 10 weeks.
And I was dragging all the food I needed,
the supplies, the equipment, sleeping bag,
one change of underwear -- everything I needed for nearly three months.
(Laughter)
What we're going to try and do today, in the 16 and a bit minutes I've got left,
is to try and answer three questions. The first one is, why?
The second one is,
how do you go to the loo at minus 40?
"Ben, I've read somewhere that at minus 40,
exposed skin becomes frostbitten in less than a minute, so how do you answer the call of nature?"
I don't want to answer these now. I'll come on to them at the end.
Third one: how do you top that? What's next?
My first expedition was with a guy called Pen Hadow -- enormously experienced chap.
This was like my polar apprenticeship.
We were trying to ski from this group of islands up here,
Severnaya Zemlya, to the North Pole.
And the thing that fascinates me about the North Pole,
geographic North Pole, is that it's slap bang in the middle of the sea.
This is about as good as maps get,
and to reach it you've got to ski literally
over the frozen crust,
the floating skin of ice on the Artic Ocean.
I'd spoken to all the experts.
I'd read lots of books. I studied maps and charts.
But I realized on the morning of day one
that I had no idea exactly
what I'd let myself in for.
had attempted anything like this,
and pretty quickly, almost everything
that could have gone wrong did go wrong.
We were attacked by a polar bear on day two.
I had frostbite in my left big toe.
We started running very low on food. We were both pretty hungry, losing lots of weight.
Some very unusual weather conditions, very difficult ice conditions.
We had
decidedly low-tech communications.
We couldn't afford a satellite phone, so we had HF radio.
You can see two ski poles sticking out of the roof of the tent.
There's a wire dangling down either side.
That was our HF radio antenna.
We had less than two hours
two-way communication with the outside world in two months.
Ultimately, we ran out of time.
We'd skied 400 miles. We were just over 200 miles left
to go to the Pole, and we'd run out of time.
We were too late into the summer; the ice was starting to melt;
we spoke to the Russian helicopter pilots on the radio,
and they said, "Look boys, you've run out of time.
We've got to pick you up."
And I felt that I had failed, wholeheartedly.
I was a failure.
for as long as I could remember -- I hadn't even come close.
And skiing along that first trip, I had two
imaginary video clips that I'd replay over and over again in my mind
when the going got tough, just to keep my motivation going.
The first one was reaching the Pole itself.
I could see vividly, I suppose,
being filmed out of the door of a helicopter, there was, kind of, rock music playing in the background,
and I had a ski pole with a Union Jack, you know, flying in the wind.
I could see myself sticking the flag in a pole, you know --
ah, glorious moment -- the music kind of reaching a crescendo.
The second video clip
that I imagined was getting back to Heathrow airport,
and I could see again, vividly,
the camera flashbulbs going off,
the paparazzi, the autograph hunters,
the book agents coming to sign me up for a deal.
And of course, neither of these things happened.
We didn't get to the Pole, and we didn't have any money
to pay anyone to do the PR, so no one had heard
of this expedition.
my granddad was there -- had a little Union Jack --
(Laughter)
-- and that was about it. I went back to live with my mum.
I was physically exhausted,
mentally an absolute wreck, considered myself a failure.
In a huge amount of debt personally to this expedition,
and lying on my mum's sofa,
day in day out, watching daytime TV.
My brother sent me a text message, an SMS --
it was a quote from the "Simpsons." It said,
"You tried your hardest and failed miserably.
The lesson is: don't even try."
(Laughter)
and start planning another expedition. This time,
I wanted to go right across, on my own this time,
from Russia, at the top of the map,
to the North Pole, where the sort of kink in the middle is,
and then on to Canada.
No one has made a complete crossing of the Arctic Ocean on their own.
Two Norwegians did it as a team in 2000. No one's done it solo.
Very famous, very accomplished Italian mountaineer,
Reinhold Messner, tried it in 1995,
and he was rescued after a week.
He described this expedition as 10 times
as dangerous as Everest.
So for some reason, this was what I wanted to have a crack at,
but I knew that even to stand a chance of getting home in one piece,
let alone make it across to Canada,
I had to take a radical approach.
This meant everything from perfecting the
sawn-off, sub-two-gram toothbrush,
to working with one of the world's leading nutritionists
in developing a completely new,
revolutionary nutritional strategy from scratch:
6,000 calories a day.
Big support team. We had a film crew,
a couple of logistics people with us,
my girlfriend, a photographer.
At first it was pretty sensible. We flew British Airways to Moscow.
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk,
on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir,
spelled K-R-A-S.
The next bit, we'd chartered a pretty elderly Russian plane
to fly us up to a town called Khatanga,
which was the sort of last bit of civilization.
Our cameraman, who it turned out was a pretty nervous flier at the best of times,
actually asked the pilot, before we got on the plane, how long this flight would take,
and the pilot -- Russian pilot -- completely deadpan, replied,
"Six hours -- if we live."
(Laughter)
We got to Khatanga.
I think the joke is that Khatanga isn't the end of the world,
but you can see it from there.
(Laughter)
It was supposed to be an overnight stay. We were stuck there for 10 days.
There was a kind of vodka-fueled pay dispute between
the helicopter pilots and the people that owned the helicopter,
so we were stuck. We couldn't move.
Finally, morning of day 11, we got the all-clear,
loaded up the helicopters -- two helicopters flying in tandem --
dropped me off at the edge of the pack ice.
We had a frantic sort of 45 minutes of filming,
photography; while the helicopter was still there,
I did an interview on the satellite phone;
and then everyone else climbed back into the helicopter,
wham, the door closed, and I was alone.
All I could think about was running back up to the door,
banging on the door, and saying, "Look guys,
I haven't quite thought this through."
(Laughter)
To make things worse, you can just see the white dot
up at the top right hand side of the screen; that's a full moon.
the full moon brings the highest and lowest tides;
when you're standing on the frozen surface of the sea,
high and low tides generally mean
that interesting things are going to happen -- the ice is going to start moving around a bit.
I was, you can see there, pulling two sledges.
Grand total in all, 95 days of food and fuel,
180 kilos -- that's almost exactly 400 pounds.
When the ice was flat or flattish,
I could just about pull both.
When the ice wasn't flat, I didn't have a hope in hell.
I had to pull one, leave it, and go back and get the other one.
Literally scrambling through what's called pressure ice --
the ice had been smashed up under the pressure of the currents of the ocean,
the wind and the tides.
NASA described the ice conditions last year as the worst since records began.
And it's always drifting. The pack ice is always drifting.
I was skiing into headwinds for nine
out of the 10 weeks I was alone last year,
and I was drifting backwards most of the time.
My record was minus 2.5 miles.
I got up in the morning, took the tent down, skied north for seven-and-a-half hours,
put the tent up, and I was two and a half miles further back
than when I'd started.
I literally couldn't keep up with the drift of the ice.
I'm lying in the tent, getting ready to go.
The weather is just appalling --
oh, drifted back about five miles
in the last -- last night.
Later in the expedition, the problem was no longer the ice.
It was a lack of ice -- open water.
I knew this was happening. I knew the Artic was warming.
I knew there was more open water. And I had a secret weapon up my sleeve.
This was my little bit of bio-mimicry.
Polar bears on the Artic Ocean move in dead straight lines.
If they come to water, they'll climb in, swim across it.
So we had a dry suit developed -- I worked with a team in Norway --
based on a sort of survival suit --
I suppose, that helicopter pilots would wear --
that I could climb into. It would go on over my boots, over my mittens,
it would pull up around my face, and seal pretty tightly around my face.
And this meant I could ski
over very thin ice,
and if I fell through, it wasn't the end of the world.
It also meant, if the worst came to the worst,
I could actually jump in and swim across
and drag the sledge over after me.
Some pretty radical technology,
a radical approach --but it worked perfectly.
was with communications technology.
In 1912, Shackleton's Endurance expedition --
there was -- one of his crew, a guy called Thomas Orde-Lees.
He said, "The explorers of 2012,
if there is anything left to explore,
will no doubt carry pocket wireless telephones
fitted with wireless telescopes."
Well, Orde-Lees guessed wrong by about eight years. This is my pocket wireless telephone,
Iridium satellite phone.
The wireless telescope was a digital camera I had tucked in my pocket.
And every single day of the 72 days I was alone on the ice,
I was blogging live from my tent,
sending back a little diary piece,
sending back information on the distance I'd covered --
the ice conditions, the temperature --
and a daily photo.
Remember, 2001,
we had less than two hours radio contact with the outside world.
Last year, blogging live from an expedition
that's been described as 10 times as dangerous as Everest.
It wasn't all high-tech. This is navigating
in what's called a whiteout.
When you get lots of mist, low cloud, the wind starts blowing the snow up.
You can't see an awful lot. You can just see, there's a yellow
ribbon tied to one of my ski poles.
I'd navigate using the direction of the wind.
So, kind of a weird combination of high-tech and low-tech.
It took me 68 days to get there from Russia,
and there is nothing there.
(Laughter).
There isn't even a pole at the Pole. There's nothing there,
purely because it's sea ice. It's drifting.
Stick a flag there, leave it there, pretty soon it will drift off, usually towards Canada or Greenland.
I knew this, but I was expecting something.
Strange mixture of feelings: it was extremely warm by this stage,
a lot of open water around, and
of course, elated that I'd got there under my own steam,
but starting to really realize
that my chances of making it all the way across to Canada,
which was still 400 miles away,
were slim at best.
The only proof I've got that I was there
is a blurry photo of my GPS, the little satellite navigation gadget.
You can just see --
there's a nine and a string of zeros here.
Ninety degrees north -- that is slap bang in the North Pole.
I took a photo of that. Sat down on my sledge. Did a sort of video diary piece.
Took a few photos. I got my satellite phone out.
I warmed the battery up in my armpit.
I dialed three numbers. I dialed my mum.
I dialed my girlfriend. I dialed the CEO of my sponsor.
And I got three voicemails.
(Laughter)
(Video): Ninety.
It's a special feeling.
The entire planet
is rotating
beneath my feet.
The -- the whole world underneath me.
I finally got through to my mum. She was at the queue of the supermarket.
She started crying. She asked me to call her back.
(Laughter)
I wanted to get as close to Canada as I could
before conditions just got too dangerous to continue.
This was the last day I had on the ice.
When I spoke to the -- my project management team,
they said, "Look, Ben, conditions are getting too dangerous.
There are huge areas of open water just south of your position.
We'd like to pick you up.
Ben, could you please look for an airstrip?"
This was the view outside my tent
when I had this fateful phone call.
I'd never tried to build an airstrip before. Tony, the expedition manager, he said,
"Look Ben, you've got to find 500 meters of
flat, thick safe ice."
The only bit of ice I could find --
it took me 36 hours of skiing around trying to find an airstrip --
was exactly 473 meters. I could measure it with my skis.
I didn't tell Tony that. I didn't tell the pilots that.
I thought, it'll have to do.
(Video): Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
the plane actually passed over four times,
and I was a bit worried it wasn't going to land at all.
The pilot, I knew, was called Troy. I was expecting someone called Troy
that did this for a living to be a pretty tough kind of guy.
I was bawling my eyes out by the time the plane landed -- a pretty emotional moment.
So I thought, I've got to compose myself for Troy.
I'm supposed to be the roughty toughty explorer type.
The plane taxied up to where I was standing.
The door opened. This guy jumped out. He's about that tall. He said, "Hi, my name is Troy."
(Laughter).
The co-pilot was a lady called Monica.
She sat there in a sort of hand-knitted jumper.
They were the least macho people I've ever met, but they made my day.
Troy was smoking a cigarette on the ice;
we took a few photos. He
climbed up the ladder. He said, "Just -- just get in the back."
He threw his cigarette out as he got on the front,
and I climbed in the back.
(Laughter)
Taxied up and down the runway a few times,
just to flatten it out a bit, and he said, "Right, I'm going to --
I'm going to give it a go." And he --
I've now learned that this is standard practice, but it had me worried at the time.
He put his hand on the throttle.
You can see the control for the engines is actually on the roof of the cockpit.
It's that little bar there. He put his hand on the throttle.
Monica very gently put her hand sort of on top of his.
I thought, "God, here we go. We're, we're -- this is all or nothing."
Rammed it forwards. Bounced down the runway. Just took off.
One of the skis just clipped a pressure ridge at the end of the runway,
banking. I could see into the cockpit, Troy battling the controls,
and he just took one hand off, reached back,
flipped a switch on the roof of the cockpit,
and it was the "fasten seat belt" sign you can see on the wall.
(Laughter)
And only from the air did I see the big picture.
Of course, when you're on the ice, you only ever see one obstacle at a time,
whether it's a pressure ridge or there's a bit of water.
This is probably why I didn't get into trouble about the length of my airstrip.
I mean, it really was starting to break up.
I'm not skiing along drawing maps;
everyone knows where the North Pole is.
At the South Pole there's a big scientific base. There's an airstrip.
There's a cafe and there's a tourist shop.
For me, this is about exploring human limits,
about exploring the limits of physiology, of psychology
and of technology. They're the things that excite me.
And it's also about potential, on a personal level.
This, for me, is a chance to explore the limits --
really push the limits of my own potential, see how far they stretch.
And on a wider scale, it amazes me how people go through life
just scratching the surface of their potential,
just doing three or four or five percent
of what they're truly capable of. So,
on a wider scale, I hope that this journey
was a chance to inspire other people
to think about what they want to do
with their potential, and what they want to do with the tiny amount of time
we each have on this planet.
That's as close as I can come to summing that up.
The answer, of course, to which is a trade secret --
and the last question,
what's next? As quickly as possible,
if I have a minute left at the end, I'll go into more detail.
What's next:
Antarctica.
It's the coldest, highest,
windiest and driest continent on Earth.
Late 1911, early 1912,
there was a race to be the first
to the South Pole: the heart of the Antarctic continent.
If you include the coastal ice shelves, you can see that the Ross Ice Shelf --
it's the big one down here -- the Ross Ice Shelf is the size of France.
Antarctica, if you include the ice shelves,
is twice the size of Australia -- it's a big place.
And there's a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen,
the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies --
and Scott, the British guy, Captain Scott.
Scott had sort of ponies and some tractors
and a few dogs, all of which went wrong,
and Scott and his team of four people ended up on foot.
They got to the Pole late January 1912
to find a Norwegian flag already there.
There was a tent, a letter to the Norwegian king.
And they turned around, headed back to the coast,
and all five of them died on the return journey.
Since then, no one has ever skied --
this was 93 years ago -- since then, no one has ever skied
from the coast of Antarctica to the Pole and back.
Every South Pole expedition you may have heard about
is either flown out from the Pole or has used vehicles
or dogs or kites to do some kind of crossing --
no one has ever made a return journey. So that's the plan.
Two of us are doing it.
That's pretty much it.
is, I have a -- and I meant to scan this and I've forgotten --
but I have a -- I have a school report. I was 13 years old,
and it's framed above my desk at home. It says,
"Ben lacks sufficient impetus
to achieve anything worthwhile."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I think if I've learned anything, it's this: that no one else
is the authority on your potential.
You're the only person that decides how far you go and what you're capable of.
Ladies and gentlemen, that's my story.
Thank you very much.
My name is Art Benjamin, and I am a "mathemagician."
What that means is, I combine my loves of math and magic
By any chance, did anyone happen
to bring with them this morning a calculator?
Now bring it out, bring it out. Anybody else?
I see, I see one way in the back.
You sir, that's three.
And anybody on this side here?
How about a two-digit number?
What I'm going to try and do then --
I notice it took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer.
For instance, five squared would be?
and on most calculators that will give you the square.
On some of these ancient RPN calculators,
you've got an "x squared" button on it,
will allow you to do the calculation even faster.
What I'm going to try and do now is to square, in my head,
four two-digit numbers
What I'll use is the second row this time,
So quickly, a two-digit number please.
I'm going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time.
I won't even write these down --
I'll just call them out as they're called out to me.
Anyone on our panel, verify the answer.
Just give some indication if it's right.
Another three-digit --
Is that 513,284?
162 squared is 26,244.
9,758, this will take me a little bit of time, so bear with me.
and I can --
In the meanwhile, let me conclude
the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier.
And instead of squaring it this time,
I want you to take that number and multiply it
by any three-digit number that you want,
but don't tell me what you're multiplying by --
or at least the improbable.
the day of the week that they were born on?
If you think you know your birth day, raise your hand.
Let's see, starting with -- let's start with a gentleman first.
I haven't seen any women's hands up.
OK, how about you, what year?
Yes! I'll go way to the back right now, how about you?
Call out, what year was it?
Who wanted to know their birth day?
What year was it, first of all?
Can you confirm, Chris?
either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s --
AB: And what month?
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator.
so I can see where you are.
You have a 10-digit calculator, sir, as well?
OK, what I'm going to try and do, is to square in my head
a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator.
But to make my job more interesting for you, as well as for me,
So you can actually, honestly hear
I think we're OK.
I'm going to break the problem down into three parts.
Let me explain what that is.
you can talk to me then.
By the way, one last instruction,
for my judges with the calculators --
If I do, don't tell me what the mistake is;
just say, "you're close," or something like that,
If, however, I am right,
whatever you do, don't keep it to yourself, OK?
So, without any more stalling,
here we go.
38,931; double that to get 77,862.
77,862 becomes cookie fission,
cookie fission is 77,822.
That seems right, I'll go on. Cookie fission, OK.
oops, but I see a carry coming --
249 --
add that to cookie, 250 plus 77,
is 327 million --
that's 700 times 666, plus 17 squared
is 466,489, rev up if I need it,
rev up, take the 466,
328,489.
So my grandfather told me when I was a little girl,
"If you say a word often enough, it becomes you."
And having grown up in a segregated city, Baltimore, Maryland,
I sort of use that idea to go around America with a tape recorder --
thank God for technology --
to interview people, thinking that if I walked in their words --
which is also why I don't wear shoes when I perform --
if I walked in their words, that I could sort of absorb America.
I was also inspired by Walt Whitman,
who wanted to absorb America and have it absorb him.
that I've been doing for many years now,
and well over, I don't know, a couple of thousand people
I've interviewed.
Anybody out here old enough to know Studs Terkel, that old radio man?
So I thought he would be the perfect person
to go to to ask about a defining moment in American history.
You know, he was "born in 1912, the year the Titanic sank,
greatest ship every built. Hits the tip of an iceberg,
and bam, it went down. It went down and I came up. Wow, some century."
(Laughter)
"Defining moment in American history, I don't think there's one;
you can't say Hiroshima, that's a big one --
I can't think of any one moment I would say is a defining moment.
The gradual slippage -- 'slippage' is the word
used by the people in Watergate, moral slippage --
it's a gradual kind of thing, combination of things.
You see, we also have the technology.
I say, less and less the human touch.
The Atlanta airport is a modern airport,
and they should leave the gate there.
These trains that take you out to a concourse and on to a destination.
And these trains are smooth,
and they're quiet and they're efficient.
And there's a voice on the train, you know the voice was a human voice.
You see in the old days we had robots, robots imitated humans.
Now we have humans imitating robots.
So we got this voice on this train: Concourse One: Omaha, Lincoln.
Concourse Two: Dallas, Fort Worth. Same voice.
Just as a train is about to go, a young couple rush in
and they're just about to close the pneumatic doors.
And that voice, without losing a beat, says,
'Because of late entry, we're delayed 30 seconds.'
Just then, everybody's looking at this couple with hateful eyes
and the couple's going like this, you know, shrinking.
Well, I'd happened to have had a couple of drinks before boarding --
I do that to steel my nerves -- and so
I imitate a train call, holding my hand on my --
'George Orwell, your time has come,' you see.
Well, some of you are laughing. Everybody laughs
when I say that, but not on this train. Silence.
And so suddenly they're looking at me.
So here I am with the couple, the three of us
shrinking at the foot of Calvary about to be up, you know.
I know it's Hispanic because she's speaking Spanish to her companion.
So I'm going to talk to the baby. So I say to the baby,
holding my hand over my mouth because my breath must be 100 proof,
I say to the baby, 'Sir or Madam,
what is your considered opinion of the human species?'
And the baby looks, you know, the way babies look at you clearly,
starts laughing,
starts busting out with this crazy little laugh.
I say, 'Thank God for a human reaction, we haven't lost yet.'
You know, you see, you've got to question the official truth.
You know the thing that was so great about Mark Twain --
you know we honor Mark Twain, but we don't read him.
We read 'Huck Finn,' of course, we read 'Huck Finn' of course.
I mean, Huck, of course, was tremendous.
Remember that great scene on the raft, remember what Huck did?
You see, here's Huck; he's an illiterate kid; he's had no schooling,
but there's something in him.
And the official truth, the truth was, the law was,
that a black man was a property, was a thing, you see.
And he hears that Jim is going to go and take his wife and kids
and steal them from the woman who owns them,
and Huck says, 'Ooh, oh my God, ooh, ooh --
that woman, that woman never did anybody any harm.
Ooh, he's going to steal; he's going to steal;
he's going to do a terrible thing.'
Just then, two slavers caught up, guys chasing slaves, looking for Jim.
'Anybody up on that raft with you?' Huck says, 'Yeah.'
'Is he black or white?' 'White.' And they go off.
And Huck said, 'Oh my God, oh my God, I lied, I lied, ooh,
I did a terrible thing, did a terrible thing -- why do I feel so good?'
you see, all been buried; it's all been buried.
So the human touch, you see, it's disappearing.
So you ask about a defining moment --
ain't no defining moment in American history for me.
It's an accretion of moments that add up to where we are now,
where trivia becomes news.
And more and more, less and less awareness of the pain of the other.
Huh. You know, I don't know if you could use this or not,
but I was quoting Wright Morris, a writer from Nebraska, who says,
'We're more and more into communications
and less and less into communication.'
Okay, kids, I got to scram, got to go see my cardiologist."
And that's Studs Terkel.
(Applause)
You know, most actors want to do characters that are likeable --
well, not always, but the notion, especially at a conference like this,
I like to inspire people.
But since this was called "risk taking,"
I'm doing somebody who I never do, because she's so unlikeable
that one person actually came backstage
and told me to take her out of the show she was in.
And I'm doing her because I think we think of risk,
at a conference like this, as a good thing.
and the same thing about the word "nature." What is nature?
Maxine Greene, who's a wonderful philosopher
who's as old as Studs, and was the head of a philosophy --
great, big philosophy kind of an organization --
I went to her and asked her what are the two things
that she doesn't know, that she still wants to know.
And she said, "Well, personally, I still feel like I have to curtsey
when I see the president of my university.
And I still feel as though I've got to get coffee
for my male colleagues, even though I've outlived most of them."
And she said, "And then intellectually,
I don't know enough about the negative imagination.
And September 11th certainly taught us
that that's a whole area we don't investigate."
It raises questions about what nature is, what Mother Nature is,
and about what a risk can be.
And I got this in the Maryland Correctional Institute for Women.
Everything I do is word for word off a tape.
And I title things because I think people speak in organic poems,
and this is called "A Mirror to Her Mouth."
And this is an inmate named Paulette Jenkins.
because I didn't want nobody to know that this was happening in my home.
I want everybody to think we were a normal family.
I mean we had all the materialistic things,
but that didn't make my children pain any less;
that didn't make their fears subside.
I ran out of excuses about how we got black eyes
and busted lips and bruises. I didn't had no more excuses.
And he beat me too. But that didn't change the fact
that it was a nightmare for my family; it was a nightmare.
And I failed them dramatically,
because I allowed it to go on and on and on.
and the intensity just grew and grew and grew,
until one night we came home from getting drugs,
and he got angry with Myesha, and he started beating her,
and he put her in a bathtub. Oh, he would use a belt.
He had a belt because he had this warped perverted thing
that Myesha was having sex with her little brother
and they was fondling each other -- that would be his reason.
I'm just talking about the particular night that she died.
And so he put her in the bathtub,
and I was in the bedroom with the baby.
I thought I could really fix this man. So I had a baby by him -- insane --
thinking that if I gave him his own kid, he would leave mine alone.
And it didn't work, didn't work.
And I ended up with three children, Houston, Myesha and Dominic,
who was four months old when I came to jail.
and he -- he -- every time he hit her, she would fall.
And she would hit her head on the tub. It happened continuously, repeatedly.
I could hear it, but I dared not to move. I didn't move.
I didn't even go and see what was happening.
I just sat there and listened.
And then he put her in the hallway.
He told her, just set there. And so she set there for about four or five hours.
And then he told her, get up.
And when she got up, she says she couldn't see.
Her face was bruised. She had a black eye.
All around her head was just swollen;
her head was about two sizes of its own size.
I told him, 'Let her go to sleep.' He let her go to sleep.
He went in to check on her for school, and he got very excited.
He says, 'She won't breathe.'
I knew immediately that she was dead.
I didn't even want to accept the fact that she was dead, so I went in
and I put a mirror to her mouth --
there was no thing, nothing, coming out of her mouth.
He said, he said, he said,
'We can't, we can't let nobody find out about this.'
He say, 'You've got to help me.' I agree. I agree.
so it just seemed like second hand to me, just to keep on keeping it a secret.
So we went to the mall and we told a police that we had, like, lost her,
that she was missing.
We told a security guard that she was missing,
though she wasn't missing.
And we told the security guard what we had put on her
and we went home and we dressed her in exactly the same thing
that we had told the security guard that we had put on her.
and we drove out to, like, I-95.
I was so petrified and so numb,
all I could look was in the rear-view mirror.
And he just laid her right on the shoulder of the highway.
My own child, I let that happen to."
So that's an investigation of the negative imagination.
(Applause)
called "On the Road: A Search For an American Character"
with my tape recorder, I thought that I was going to go around America
and find it in all its aspects -- bull riders, cowboys, pig farmers,
drum majorettes -- but I sort of got tripped on race relations,
because my first big show was a show about a race riot.
And so I went to both -- two race riots,
one of which was the Los Angeles riot. And this next piece is from that.
Because this is what I would say
I've learned the most about race relations, from this piece.
It's a kind of an aria, I would say, and in many tapes that I have.
because four cops beat up a black man named Rodney King.
It was captured on videotape -- technology --
and it was played all over the world.
Everybody thought the four cops would go to jail.
They did not, so there were riots.
And what a lot of people forget, is there was a second trial,
ordered by George Bush, Sr.
And that trial came back with two cops going to jail
and two cops declared innocent. I was at that trial.
And I mean, the people just danced in the streets
because they were afraid there was going to be another riot.
Explosion of joy that this verdict had come back this way.
whose stores had been burned to the ground.
And so this woman, Mrs. Young-Soon Han,
I suppose will have taught me the most that I have learned about race.
And she asks also a question that Studs talks about:
this notion of the "official truth," to question the "official truth."
So what she's questioning here, she's taking a chance
and questioning what justice is in society.
And this is called, "Swallowing the Bitterness."
I watched in Korea many luxurious Hollywood lifestyle movie.
I never saw any poor man, any black.
Until 1992, I used to believe America was the best -- I still do;
I don't deny that because I am a victim.
But at the end of '92, when we were in such turmoil,
and having all the financial problems, and all the mental problems,
I began to really realize that Koreans
are completely left out of this society and we are nothing.
Why? Why do we have to be left out?
We didn't qualify for medical treatment, no food stamp, no GR,
got minimum amount of money to survive.
We didn't get any because we have a car and a house.
And we are high taxpayer. Where do I find justice?
"OK. OK? OK. OK.
Many African-Americans probably think that they won by the trial.
I was sitting here watching them the morning after the verdict,
and all the day they were having a party, they celebrated,
all of South Central, all the churches. And they say,
'Well, finally justice has been done in this society.'
Well, what about victims' rights?
They got their rights by destroying innocent Korean merchants.
They have a lot of respect, as I do, for Dr. Martin King.
He is the only model for black community; I don't care Jesse Jackson.
He is the model of non-violence, non-violence --
and they would all like to be in his spirit.
And I wonder if that is really justice
for them, to get their rights in that way.
I was swallowing the bitterness, sitting here alone and watching them.
They became so hilarious, but I was happy for them.
I was glad for them. At least they got something back, OK.
Let's just forget about Korean victims and other victims
who were destroyed by them.
They fought for their rights for over two centuries,
and maybe because they sacrifice other minorities,
Hispanic, Asian, we would suffer more in the mainstream.
That's why I understand;
that's why I have a mixed feeling about the verdict.
I could be part of the enjoyment.
I wish that I could live together with black people.
But after the riot, it's too much difference.
The fire is still there. How do you say it? [Unclear].
Igniting, igniting, igniting fire. Igniting fire.
It's still there; it can burst out anytime."
Mrs. Young-Soon Han.
(Applause)
is just in case I really feel like I have to cuddle up
and get into the feet of somebody,
walking really in somebody else's shoes.
And I told you that in -- you know, I didn't give you the year,
but in '79 I thought that I was going to go around
and find bull riders and pig farmers and people like that,
and I got sidetracked on race relations.
And I've been going to the rodeos with him, and we've bonded.
And he's the lead in an op-ed I did about the Republican Convention.
He's a Republican -- I won't say anything about my party affiliation, but anyway --
so this is my dear, dear Brent Williams,
and this is on toughness,
in case anybody needs to know about being tough
for the work that you do. I think there's a real lesson in this.
And this is called "Toughness."
I mean, you know, I mean, it's like my wife, Jolene,
her family's always saying,
you know, you ever think he's just a born loser?
It seems like he has so much bad luck, you know.
But then when that bull stepped on my kidney, you know,
I didn't lose my kidney -- I could have lost my kidney,
I kept my kidney, so I don't think I'm a born loser.
I think that's good luck.
(Laughter)
I was in a doctor's office last CAT scan,
and there was a Reader's Digest, October 2002.
It was like, 'seven ways to get lucky.' And it says
if you want to get lucky,
you know, you've got to be around positive people.
I mean, like even when I told my wife that you want to come out here
and talk to me, she's like, 'She's just talking;
she's just being nice to you. She's not going to do that.'
and interview me and she went and looked you up on the Internet.
She said, 'Look who she is.
You're not even going to be able to answer her questions.'
(Laughter)
And she was saying you're going to make me look like an idiot
because I've never been to college,
and I wouldn't be talking professional or anything.
I said, 'Well look, the woman talked to me for four hours.
You know, if I wasn't talking -- you know,
like, you know, she wanted me to talk,
I don't think she would even come out here.'
more out of determination than confidence.
I mean, confidence is like, you know,
you've been on that bull before; you know you can ride him.
I mean, confidence is kind of like being cocky, but in a good way.
But determination, you know, it's like just, you know, 'Fuck the form,
get the horn.'
(Laughter)
That's Tuff Hedeman, in the movie '8 Seconds.'
I mean, like, Pat O'Mealey always said when I was a boy,
he say, 'You know, you got more try than any kid I ever seen.'
And try and determination is the same thing.
Determination is, like, you're going to hang on that bull,
even if you're riding upside down.
Determination's like, you're going to ride
till your head hits the back of the dirt.
Well, you know, I guess that'd have to be the rodeo too.
I mean, look how we are, the roughy family,
palling around and shaking hands and wrestling around me.
It's like, you know, racking up our credit cards on entry fees and gas.
We ride together, we, you know, we, we eat together
and we sleep together.
I mean, I can't even imagine what it's going to be like
the last day I rodeo. I mean, I'll be alright.
I mean, I have my ranch and everything,
but I actually don't even want to think the day that comes.
I mean, I guess it just be like --
I guess it be like the day my brother died.
shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a --
you know, busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital.
And they had to sew me up and straighten my nose out.
And I had to go and ride in the rodeo that night,
so I didn't want them to put me under anesthesia,
or whatever you call it. And so they sewed my face up.
And then they had to straighten out my nose,
and they took these rods and shoved them up my nose
and went up through my brains
and felt like it was coming out the top of my head,
and everybody said that it should have killed me,
but it didn't, because I guess I have a high tolerance for pain.
(Laughter)
But the good thing was, once they shoved those rods up there
and straightened my nose out, I could breathe,
and I hadn't been able to breathe
since I broke my nose in the high school rodeo."
(Applause)
I'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects.
I think it's one of the most exciting that I'm working on,
but I think it's also the simplest.
the number one cause of death in children under five.
A couple years ago there was severe flooding
It's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage.
They know perfectly well, but they have no other choice.
Fossil fuels are not available,
and solar energy doesn't cook the way that they like their food prepared.
And so this is what they do.
You'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree,
cut it down and make charcoal out of it.
and we worked with Peace Corps volunteers there.
they were able to triple the throughput of this device.
So you could imagine they were very excited about it.
And they took the briquettes back to MIT so that they could test them.
So it was a little discouraging to the students.
And while it was a good use of government paperwork
to come up with an alternative cooking fuel.
that used something that was readily available on the local level.
And the waste product from them
It just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it.
to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel
that would be something that people could easily cook with,
something like charcoal.
However, you can't burn this.
It's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking.
And so what we did was we looked,
a very starchy root vegetable.
And you can make a very thick, sticky porridge out of it,
which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes.
or Charcoal Institute.
And more than in Haiti, this produces really smoky fires,
and this is where you see the health impacts
of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel.
which they used ordinarily for their fuel.
And you can see that it's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel.
And in fact, it heats the water a lot more quickly.
And so we were very happy, thus far.
But one of the things that we found
was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal,
and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking.
in order to compress a briquette to the level
that you actually are getting improved performance out of it?
we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal,
which is a very wonderful place to be.
There's a possibility of this being implemented
and an average income of less than 400 dollars.
is I have a friend up at UC Berkeley who's been doing risk analysis.
And he's looked at the problem of the health impacts
of burning wood versus charcoal.
that's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel.
And the beauty of this is that you don't need to form briquettes --
And actually, like Nick, I brought samples.
Compared to the sugarcane charcoal,
where we have to teach people how to form it into briquettes
and you have the extra step of cooking the binder,
And this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now,
which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life.
you have environmental benefits.
They can generate income from this.
They can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal
and they can produce excess and sell it in the market
to people who aren't making their own.
is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in.
I mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday
you're still only earning 60 dollars in a month.
in this room, only three of us would have a car.
100 of you would have AIDS or HIV.
And more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day.
These are the solutions that we need to find.
using the same traditional basket making, poultry rearing, etc.
to add value to their own crops.
so that we're not promoting educational campaigns
to get them to stop being farmers,
but rather to stop being poor farmers.
And we need to think about how we can do that effectively.
and give them the resources and the tools that they need
so that communities can maintain their own water systems,
know when they're working, know when they treat them, etc.
and improving the ability to be able to do that.
for making things move forward.
We have 30 students a year go out into the field
as, you know, you can't expect to get something done in a year or two years;
you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead.
But I think with the vision to do that, we can move forward.
When I'm starting talks like this,
I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability
because a lot of people out there don't know what that is.
This is a crowd that does know what it is,
so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?
Fill in the blanks.
So, you know, sustainability, small planet.
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.
You know, about a million years ago,
a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,
got a little clever, harnessed fire,
invented the printing press,
made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,
the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,
it's got some major, major flaws.
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.
How much stuff goes through your life,
how much waste is left behind you.
And we, at the moment, in our society,
have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.
We're using up about five planets.
If everybody on the planet lived the way we did,
we'd need between five, six, seven,
some people even say 10 planets to make it.
Clearly we don't have 10 planets.
Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,
10 planets, one planet. Right?
We don't have that. So that's one problem.
is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?
North Americans, such as myself, you know,
we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,
and we're eating all sorts of stuff.
And, you know, then you get all the way down
to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.
And people simply do not have enough to survive.
This is producing all sorts of tensions,
all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.
And there's more and more people on the way. Right?
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.
It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.
A third of the people on this planet are kids.
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way
than their parents did, no matter where they live.
They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.
And they may not want to live exactly like us.
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits,
or Germans, or South Africans,
but they want their own version
of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,
and more, you know, enjoyable.
And all of these things combine to create
an enormous amount of torque on the planet.
And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,
we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly
facing situations which are simply unthinkable.
I don't need to go into that.
But I will ask the question, what's the alternative?
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;
on the other hand we have the unimaginable.
We don't know yet how to build a society
which is environmentally sustainable,
which is shareable with everybody on the planet,
which promotes stability and democracy and human rights,
and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary
to make it through the challenges we face.
We don't know how to do this yet.
Well, Worldchanging you might think of
as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.
You know, what we're out there doing is looking
for examples of tools, models and ideas,
which, if widely adopted, would change the game.
A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things
that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,
but most people haven't.
So I thought today I'd do something a little different,
and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,
rather than giving you tried-and-true examples.
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world
for changing the impact that we have on the planet
is changing the way that we live in cities.
We're already an urban planet;
that's especially true in the developed world.
And people who live in cities in the developed world
tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.
If we can change the dynamic,
by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,
you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.
And they are doing density, new density,
better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.
They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,
which is a pretty great thing.
So you have density. You also have growth management.
You leave aside what is natural to be natural.
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.
They've bounded the city with a line.
Nature, city. Nothing changes.
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.
You can start doing things like, you know,
transit systems that actually work to transport people,
in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.
You can also start to change what you build.
This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,
which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,
that recycle much of their water,
that are much more comfortable than standard buildings,
use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.
in close proximity to each other,
one of the things you can do is --
as information technologies develop --
you can start to have smart places.
You can start to know where things are.
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.
When you share them, you end up using less.
So one great example is car-share clubs,
which are really starting to take off in the U.S.,
have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,
do you really need your own car?
is start figuring out how to use less stuff
by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,
which I think is a pretty cool concept,
although I think it ought to work the other way around,
that it gets brighter the more you don't use.
But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.
We could just re-label things.
This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,
and on the other hand, off.
How we build things can change as well.
This is a bio-morphic building.
It takes its inspiration in form from life.
Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,
and also much more effective.
This is an example of bio-mimicry,
which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.
In this case, you have a shell design
which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.
We're starting to cover this more and more.
There's also neo-biological design,
where more and more we're actually using life itself
and the processes of life to become part of our industry.
So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.
So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for
of how to take the cities most of us live in,
and turn them into Bright Green cities.
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.
And there's a statistic I often like to use,
which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,
a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.
I was giving a talk about two months ago,
and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me
and was really flustered, and he said, look,
you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.
It's every seven days.
So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,
and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.
They don't have existing infrastructure;
they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,
and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out
how to do things in new ways.
megacities into Bright Green megacities?
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.
The idea behind leapfrogging is that
if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation
where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,
there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?
That you're much better off, almost universally,
looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?
All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,
skipping the whole landline stage.
If there are landlines in many developing world cities,
they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot
and cost enormous amounts of money.
So I rather like this picture here.
I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.
We've heard all about this here this week,
so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say
what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.
be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems
which encourage collaboration. Right?
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,
you get different kinds of solutions.
And those solutions are accessible in a different way
to people who don't have capital. Right?
So, you know, we have open source software,
we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.
And those things lead to things like this.
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.
This is a pretty remarkable program
using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,
and basically sort of abandoned buildings --
has put together a bunch of community centers
where people can come in, get high-speed internet access,
learn computer programming skills for free.
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)
And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging
is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,
and re-categorizing itself in ways
that have less and less to do with most of us in this room.
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.
It's doing something new. There's new things happening.
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.
And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.
where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.
These are people who have just been visited by
the Internet bookmobile in Uganda.
And who are waving their first books in the air,
which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together
and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,
in ways that haven't happened before.
And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,
are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,
is we've got to craft new political realities.
not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,
what have you, but here at home as well.
Another world is possible.
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?
We tweak that a lot.
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine
there being a different, vague possibility out there,
but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.
We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.
How many people knew of Lula before today?
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.
So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,
but one of the things that he's doing is,
he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that
completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue
into a whole new way of global collaboration.
I would keep your eye on this fellow.
is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.
This is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot.
"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,
while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage
in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)
Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"
which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.
These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way
to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,
in people's interest in and passion for democracy.
We get so little news about the developing world
that we often forget that there are literally
millions of people out there struggling to change things
to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.
But it's happening all over the place,
and these tools are part of what's making it possible.
when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,
you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.
You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.
It's the greenest building in the world.
You get grassroots solutions, things that work
for people who have no capital or limited access.
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.
You get access to distance medicine.
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs
to access databases that have information
that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.
You get new tools for people in the developing world.
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,
for whom nightfall means darkness,
to have a new means of operating.
These are refrigerators that require no electricity;
they're pot within a pot design.
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap
and available to people in the developing world.
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,
will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.
Here's a way of transporting water.
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,
and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?
I mean, that's a great design.
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.
Basically you can suck any water through this
and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.
So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.
This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,
which pumps water as kids play. You know?
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?
because of climate change and political instability.
How do we help people like that?
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs
that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.
Some of those designs include models for acting,
such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.
New models for pedagogy for the displaced.
And we have new tools.
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.
Does anyone know what this is?
If you are living in one of the places
where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,
you can fling these seeds out into the field.
And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,
their roots will detect the chemicals in them,
and where the flowers turn red you don't step.
Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?
that the example, the tools we use to change the world,
ought to be beautiful in themselves.
You know, that it's not just enough to survive.
We've got to make something better than what we've got.
And I think that we will.
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,
I think that better things are on the way.
I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.
All that the human mind has accomplished
is but the dream before the awakening."
I hope that that turns out to be true.
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.
I'm going to talk to you today about
hopefully converting fear into hope.
When we go to the physician today --
when we go to the doctor's office and we walk in,
there are words that we just don't want to hear.
There are words that we're truly afraid of.
Diabetes, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's,
heart failure, lung failure --
things that we know are debilitating diseases,
for which there's relatively little that can be done.
a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease,
why it's important,
why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down
if you think it already hasn't,
and where we are clinically today, and where we might go tomorrow,
and what some of the hurdles are.
And we're going to do all of that in 18 minutes, I promise.
because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it.
This was an issue from 2002
that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human.
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue.
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept
that everybody can understand.
It's simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself
to a clinically relevant timescale.
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there.
We know that if we have a damaged hip, you can put an artificial hip in.
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover.
This is not regenerative medicine.
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up
when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago.
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms
with devices and drugs and the like --
and I'll come back to that theme a few times --
instead of doing that, we will regenerate lost function of the body
by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue.
So that at the end of the treatment,
you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment.
very few good ideas are truly novel.
And this is just the same.
If you look back in history,
Charles Lindbergh, who was better known for flying airplanes,
was actually one of the first people
along with Alexis Carrel, one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller,
to begin to think about, could you culture organs?
And they published this book in 1937,
where they actually began to think about,
what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs?
We've come a long way since then.
I'm going to share with you some of the exciting work that's going on.
is share my depression about the health care system
and the need for this with you.
Many of the talks yesterday talked about
improving the quality of life, and reducing poverty,
and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe.
One of the challenges is that the richer we are, the longer we live.
And the longer we live, the more expensive it is
to take care of our diseases as we get older.
versus the percent of population over the age of 65.
And you can basically see that the richer a country is,
the older the people are within it.
Why is this important?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now?
If the average age of your population is 30,
then the average kind of disease that you have to treat
is maybe a broken ankle every now and again,
maybe a little bit of asthma.
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55,
now the average person is looking at diabetes,
early-onset diabetes, heart failure, coronary artery disease --
things that are inherently more difficult to treat,
and much more expensive to treat.
This is from "The Untied States of America."
In 1930, there were 41 workers per retiree.
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick,
paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease.
In 2010, two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized, wealthy country in the world.
How can you actually afford to treat patients
when the reality of getting old looks like this?
And you can see that right around age 45, 40 to 45,
there's a sudden spike in the cost of health care.
It's actually quite interesting. If you do the right studies,
you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care,
plotted over your lifetime.
And about seven years before you're about to die, there's a spike.
And you can actually --
(Laughter)
-- we won't get into that.
(Laughter)
that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases
and experience what I would call healthy aging.
I'd suggest there are four things,
and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system.
All those things do is change who pays.
They don't actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is.
We won't talk about that anymore. It's too depressing.
You can prevent.
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention.
is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression,
and then treating the disease to cure the disease
instead of treating a symptom.
Think of it in terms of diabetes, for instance.
Today, with diabetes, what do we do?
We diagnose the disease eventually, once it becomes symptomatic,
and then we treat the symptom for 10, 20, 30, 40 years.
And we do OK. Insulin's a pretty good therapy.
But eventually it stops working,
and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease.
to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease,
perhaps even before it was symptomatic?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it,
but if it worked, we would truly be able to do something different.
This is a newt re-growing its limb.
If a newt can do this kind of thing, why can't we?
I'll actually show you some more important features
about limb regeneration in a moment.
But what we're talking about in regenerative medicine
is doing this in every organ system of the body,
for tissues and for organs themselves.
So today's reality is that if we get sick,
the message is we will treat your symptoms,
and you need to adjust to a new way of life.
and when tomorrow is we could debate,
but it's within the foreseeable future --
we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation.
There's a limb prosthetic up here,
similar actually one on the soldier
that's come back from Iraq.
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs.
Imagine if instead of facing that, they could actually
face the regeneration of that limb.
It's a wild concept.
I'll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept.
How can we do that?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body.
We need to learn to speak the body's language.
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus.
A mammalian fetus, if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy,
will re-grow that limb.
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms.
It's a natural process,
but it is lost as we age.
In a child, before the age of about six months,
if they lose their fingertip in an accident,
they'll re-grow their fingertip.
By the time they're five, they won't be able to do that anymore.
we need to speak the body's language.
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today.
I'm going to give you an example of three of these tools
through which to converse with the body.
Clearly, we heal ourselves in a natural process,
using cells to do most of the work.
Therefore, if we can find the right cells
and implant them in the body, they may do the healing.
Secondly, we can use materials.
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials.
If we can invent materials, design materials,
or extract materials from a natural environment,
then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself.
And finally, we may be able to use smart devices
that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal.
and I'm going to start with materials.
Steve Badylak -- who's at the University of Pittsburgh --
about a decade ago had a remarkable idea.
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig,
if you threw away all the cells,
and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active,
may contain all of the necessary factors and signals
that would signal the body to heal itself.
And he asked a very important question.
He asked the question,
if I take that material, which is a natural material
that usually induces healing in the small intestine,
and I place it somewhere else on a person's body,
would it give a tissue-specific response,
or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear?
The picture I'm about to show you
is a compelling picture.
(Laughter)
However, for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish --
even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends --
the lights are down. This is a good time to look at your feet,
check your Blackberry, do anything other than look at the screen.
(Laughter)
And although -- it's good to laugh before we look at this.
This is the reality of diabetes.
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics, diabetic ulcers,
we just don't connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment,
which is amputation, if you can't heal it.
So I'm going to put the slide up now. It won't be up for long.
This is a diabetic ulcer. It's tragic.
The treatment for this is amputation.
This is an older lady. She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes,
and has decided to die with what' s left of her body intact.
that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented.
That's what the wound looked like 11 weeks later.
That material contained only natural signals.
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response
that it didn't have before.
I'll let you know when you can look again.
This is a horse. The horse is not in pain.
If the horse was in pain, I wouldn't show you this slide.
The horse just has another nostril that's developed
because of a riding accident.
Just a few weeks after treatment --
in this case, taking that material, turning it into a gel,
and packing that area, and then repeating the treatment a few times --
and the horse heals up.
And if you took an ultrasound of that area, it would look great.
There are now 400,000 patients around the world
who have used that material to heal their wounds.
Could you regenerate a limb?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project
to begin the process of asking that question.
This is a 78 year-old man who's lost the end of his fingertip.
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips.
After treatment that's what it looks like.
This is happening today.
This is clinically relevant today.
There are materials that do this. Here are the heart patches.
Could you, say, instead of using material,
can I take some cells along with the material,
and remove a damaged piece of tissue,
put a bio-degradable material on there?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish.
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women's Hospital.
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish.
He chills the dish, it changes its properties
and he peels it right out of the dish.
It's the coolest stuff.
And what I'm going to show you here
is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient.
Again, if you're squeamish, you don't want to watch.
But this one's kind of cool.
So this is a bypass operation, just like what Al Gore had,
with a difference.
In this case, at the end of the bypass operation,
you're going to see the stem cells from the patient
that were removed at the beginning of the procedure
being injected directly into the heart of the patient.
And I'm standing up here because at one point
I'm going to show you just how early this technology is.
Here go the stem cells, right into the beating heart of the patient.
And if you look really carefully,
it's going to be right around this point
you'll actually see a back-flush.
You see the cells coming back out.
We need all sorts of new technology, new devices,
to get the cells to the right place at the right time.
This was a randomized trial.
At this time this was an N of 20. Now there's an N of about 100.
Basically, if you take an extremely sick patient
and you give them a bypass, they get a little bit better.
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass,
for these particular patients, they became asymptomatic.
These are now two years out.
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early,
and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state.
with only three holes in the body where they're taking the heart
and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure.
There go the cells.
We don't have time to go into all of those details,
but basically, that works too.
You can take patients who are less sick,
and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state
through that kind of therapy.
but I think very soon will be.
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh,
along with a number of colleagues around the world.
They've decided that liposuction fluid,
which -- in the United States, we have a lot of liposuction fluid.
(Laughter)
It's a great source of stem cells.
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid.
So you could go in, you could get your tummy-tuck.
Out comes the liposuction fluid,
and in this case, the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons.
All done in the lab.
And I think fairly soon, you will see patients being treated
with their own fat-derived, or adipose-derived, stem cells.
to dramatically change the way we treat disease.
Here's just one example before I close up.
This is equally tragic.
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership
with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army,
who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq.
Many of those patients are very severely burned.
it's that we don't know how to treat it.
Everything that is done to treat burn --
basically we do a sodding approach.
We make something over here,
and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound,
and we try and get the two to take.
In this case here, a new, wearable bio-reactor has been designed --
it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR --
by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh.
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed.
The gun that you see there sprays cells.
That's going to spray cells over that area.
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment,
deliver other things as well at the same time,
and therefore we will seed that lawn,
as opposed to try the sodding approach.
It's a completely different way of doing it.
So let me finish up with some good news,
and maybe a little bit of bad news.
The good news is that this is happening today.
It's very powerful work.
Clearly the images kind of get that across.
It's incredibly difficult because it's highly inter-disciplinary.
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice
is involved in trying to get this to happen.
have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease.
The Japanese government were perhaps the first,
when they decided to invest first 3 billion,
later another 2 billion in this field.
It's no coincidence.
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age.
They need this to work or their health system dies.
So they're putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area.
The European Union, same thing.
China, the same thing.
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center.
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars.
(Laughter)
Oh, for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president.
We've had a different approach.
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along.
But there's been no strategic investment
to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way.
at the director of the NIH, who's a very charming man.
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard
went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute
just a few months ago,
to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece
of that 27.5 billion dollars that he's going to get next year
and focus it, in a strategic way, to make sure we can accelerate the pace
at which these things get to patients.
And at the end of a very testy meeting,
what the NIH director said was,
"Your vision is larger than our appetite."
I'd like to close by saying that no one's going to change our vision,
but together we can change his appetite.
Thank you.
Thank you so much, Chris.
And it's truly a great honor to have the opportunity
to come to this stage twice; I'm extremely grateful.
I have been blown away by this conference,
and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments
about what I had to say the other night.
And I say that sincerely,
partly because (Mock sob)
I need that.
to illustrate what that's been like for me.
and all of a sudden it just hit me.
There was no motorcade back there.
We were on I-40.
We got to Exit 238, Lebanon, Tennessee.
We got off the exit, we found a Shoney's restaurant.
We went in and sat down at the booth, and the waitress came over,
and she lowered her voice so much,
I had to really strain to hear what she was saying.
And she said "Yes, that's former Vice President Al Gore
and his wife, Tipper."
And the man said,
"He's come down a long way, hasn't he?"
I got on a G-V to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria,
in the city of Lagos, on the topic of energy.
And I began the speech by telling them the story
of what had just happened the day before in Nashville.
And I told it pretty much the same way I've just shared it with you:
Tipper and I were driving ourselves,
I gave my speech, then went back out to the airport to fly back home.
I fell asleep on the plane
until, during the middle of the night, we landed
on the Azores Islands for refueling.
I woke up, they opened the door, I went out to get some fresh air,
and I looked, and there was a man running across the runway.
And he was waving a piece of paper, and he was yelling,
And I thought to myself, in the middle of the night,
in the middle of the Atlantic,
what in the world could be wrong in Washington?
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things.
was that my staff was extremely upset
about my speech,
and it had already been printed in cities
all across the United States of America.
It was printed in Monterey, I checked.
"Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday," quote:
'My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant'" --
and we are running it ourselves.'"
David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on --
one of them had me in a big white chef's hat,
I got a nice, long, handwritten letter
from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton, saying,
"Congratulations on the new restaurant, Al!"
since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED,
you would like me to elaborate on:
I want to start with a couple of --
I'm going to show some new images,
Now, the slide show.
I update the slide show every time I give it.
I add new images,
It's like beach-combing, you know?
Every time the tide comes in and out, you find some more shells.
Just in the last two days, we got the new temperature records in January.
This is just for the United States of America.
Historical average for Januarys is 31 degrees;
I'm kidding.
But these are the recapitulation slides,
and then I'm going to go into new material about what you can do.
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these.
First of all, this is where we're projected to go
with the U.S. contribution to global warming,
under business as usual.
Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy
is the low-hanging fruit.
Efficiency and conservation -- it's not a cost; it's a profit.
The sign is wrong.
It's not negative; it's positive.
These are investments that pay for themselves.
and it should be --
but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings
Cars and trucks are very significant,
and we have the lowest standards in the world.
And so we should address that. But it's part of the puzzle.
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks.
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency
can make this much difference.
And with what Vinod, and John Doerr and others, many of you here --
there are a lot of people directly involved in this --
this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly
than the current projection shows it.
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that's what CCS stands for --
is likely to become the killer app that will enable us
Not quite there yet.
Insulation, better design.
Buy green electricity where you can.
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid.
Figure out some of the other options that are much better.
You have choices with everything you buy,
between things that have a harsh effect,
Consider this:
Those of you who are good at branding,
I'd love to get your advice and help
on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people.
It is easier than you think.
A lot of us in here have made that decision,
and it is really pretty easy.
It means reduce your carbon dioxide emissions
with the full range of choices that you make,
and then purchase or acquire offsets
for the remainder that you have not completely reduced.
Participant Productions convened --
with my active involvement --
the leading software writers in the world,
on this arcane science of carbon calculation,
to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator.
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are,
and then you will be given options to reduce.
And by the time the movie comes out in May,
this will be updated to 2.0,
Again, some of us have done that,
Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations,
whether you are from the technology,
or entertainment, or design and architecture community.
Invest sustainably.
Majora mentioned this.
Listen, if you have invested money with managers who you compensate
on the basis of their annual performance,
And if they judge how much they're going to get paid
on your capital that they've invested,
based on the short-term returns,

The movie is a movie version of the slideshow
And it comes out in May.
Consider sending somebody to Nashville.
Pick well.
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow --
re-purposed, with some of the personal stories obviously replaced
with a generic approach,
and it's not just the slides, it's what they mean.
And it's how they link together.
And so I'm going to be conducting a course this summer
for a group of people that are nominated by different folks
to come and then give it en masse,
in communities all across the country,
and we're going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week,
to keep it right on the cutting edge.
Working with Larry Lessig, it will be, somewhere in that process,
so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way.
that you ought to stay arm's length from politics?
It doesn't mean that if you're a Republican,
We need Republicans as well.
Become politically active.
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions --
global warming pollution -- and trading it.
Here's why: as long as the United States is out of the world system,
it's not a closed system.
Once it becomes a closed system, with U.S. participation,
then everybody who's on a board of directors --
how many people here serve on the board of directors
Once it's a closed system,
you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO
to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions
that can be avoided.

Let's re-brand global warming, as many of you have suggested.
I like "climate crisis" instead of "climate collapse,"
but again, those of you who are good at branding,
Somebody said the test we're facing now, a scientist told me,
is whether the combination of an opposable thumb
and a neocortex is a viable combination.
this is not a political issue.
Again, the Republicans here -- this shouldn't be partisan.
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do.
This is an opportunity.
Not just this, but connected to the ideas that are here,
to bring more coherence to them.

because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.

we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines,
we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember,

As other speakers have said, it's a rather daunting experience --
a particularly daunting experience -- to be speaking in front of this audience.
But unlike the other speakers, I'm not going to tell you about
the mysteries of the universe, or the wonders of evolution,
or the really clever, innovative ways people are attacking
the major inequalities in our world.
Or even the challenges of nation-states in the modern global economy.
My brief, as you've just heard, is to tell you about statistics --
and, to be more precise, to tell you some exciting things about statistics.
And that's --
(Laughter)
-- that's rather more challenging
than all the speakers before me and all the ones coming after me.
(Laughter)
One of my senior colleagues told me, when I was a youngster in this profession,
rather proudly, that statisticians were people who liked figures
but didn't have the personality skills to become accountants.
(Laughter)
And there's another in-joke among statisticians, and that's,
"How do you tell the introverted statistician from the extroverted statistician?"
To which the answer is,
"The extroverted statistician's the one who looks at the other person's shoes."
(Laughter)
But I want to tell you something useful -- and here it is, so concentrate now.
This evening, there's a reception in the University's Museum of Natural History.
And it's a wonderful setting, as I hope you'll find,
and a great icon to the best of the Victorian tradition.
It's very unlikely -- in this special setting, and this collection of people --
but you might just find yourself talking to someone you'd rather wish that you weren't.
So here's what you do.
When they say to you, "What do you do?" -- you say, "I'm a statistician."
(Laughter)
Well, except they've been pre-warned now, and they'll know you're making it up.
And then one of two things will happen.
They'll either discover their long-lost cousin in the other corner of the room
and run over and talk to them.
Or they'll suddenly become parched and/or hungry -- and often both --
and sprint off for a drink and some food.
And you'll be left in peace to talk to the person you really want to talk to.
We're not top on people's lists for dinner party guests and conversations and so on.
And it's something I've never really found a good way of doing.
But my wife -- who was then my girlfriend --
managed it much better than I've ever been able to.
Many years ago, when we first started going out, she was working for the BBC in Britain,
and I was, at that stage, working in America.
I was coming back to visit her.
She told this to one of her colleagues, who said, "Well, what does your boyfriend do?"
Sarah thought quite hard about the things I'd explained --
and she concentrated, in those days, on listening.
(Laughter)
Don't tell her I said that.
And she was thinking about the work I did developing mathematical models
for understanding evolution and modern genetics.
So when her colleague said, "What does he do?"
She paused and said, "He models things."
(Laughter)
Well, her colleague suddenly got much more interested than I had any right to expect
and went on and said, "What does he model?"
Well, Sarah thought a little bit more about my work and said, "Genes."
(Laughter)
"He models genes."
What I want to do more generally is to get you thinking about
the place of uncertainty and randomness and chance in our world,
and how we react to that, and how well we do or don't think about it.
So you've had a pretty easy time up till now --
a few laughs, and all that kind of thing -- in the talks to date.
You've got to think, and I'm going to ask you some questions.
So here's the scene for the first question I'm going to ask you.
Can you imagine tossing a coin successively?
And for some reason -- which shall remain rather vague --
we're interested in a particular pattern.
Here's one -- a head, followed by a tail, followed by a tail.
Then the pattern, head-tail-tail, that we've suddenly become fixated with happens here.
And you can count: one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 --
it happens after the 10th toss.
So you might think there are more interesting things to do, but humor me for the moment.
Imagine this half of the audience each get out coins, and they toss them
until they first see the pattern head-tail-tail.
The first time they do it, maybe it happens after the 10th toss, as here.
The second time, maybe it's after the fourth toss.
The next time, after the 15th toss.
So you do that lots and lots of times, and you average those numbers.
That's what I want this side to think about.
they think, for deep cultural reasons, that's boring --
and they're much more interested in a different pattern -- head-tail-head.
So, on this side, you get out your coins, and you toss and toss and toss.
And you count the number of times until the pattern head-tail-head appears
and you average them. OK?
So on this side, you've got a number --
you've done it lots of times, so you get it accurately --
which is the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail.
On this side, you've got a number -- the average number of tosses until head-tail-head.
if you've got two numbers, one of three things must be true.
Either they're the same, or this one's bigger than this one,
or this one's bigger than that one.
So what's going on here?
So you've all got to think about this, and you've all got to vote --
and we're not moving on.
And I don't want to end up in the two-minute silence
to give you more time to think about it, until everyone's expressed a view. OK.
So what you want to do is compare the average number of tosses until we first see
head-tail-head with the average number of tosses until we first see head-tail-tail.
that, on average, it'll take longer to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
Who thinks that B is true -- that on average, they're the same?
Who thinks that C is true -- that, on average, it'll take less time
to see head-tail-head than head-tail-tail?
OK, who hasn't voted yet? Because that's really naughty -- I said you had to.
(Laughter)
OK. So most people think B is true.
And you might be relieved to know even rather distinguished mathematicians think that.
It's not. A is true here.
It takes longer, on average.
In fact, the average number of tosses till head-tail-head is 10
and the average number of tosses until head-tail-tail is eight.
How could that be?
Anything different about the two patterns?
There is. Head-tail-head overlaps itself.
If you went head-tail-head-tail-head, you can cunningly get two occurrences
of the pattern in only five tosses.
You can't do that with head-tail-tail.
That turns out to be important.
I'll give you one of them.
So imagine -- let's suppose we're doing it.
On this side -- remember, you're excited about head-tail-tail;
you're excited about head-tail-head.
We start tossing a coin, and we get a head --
and you start sitting on the edge of your seat
because something great and wonderful, or awesome, might be about to happen.
The next toss is a tail -- you get really excited.
The champagne's on ice just next to you; you've got the glasses chilled to celebrate.
You're waiting with bated breath for the final toss.
And if it comes down a head, that's great.
You're done, and you celebrate.
If it's a tail -- well, rather disappointedly, you put the glasses away
and put the champagne back.
And you keep tossing, to wait for the next head, to get excited.
It's the same for the first two parts of the sequence.
You're a little bit excited with the first head --
you get rather more excited with the next tail.
Then you toss the coin.
If it's a tail, you crack open the champagne.
If it's a head you're disappointed,
but you're still a third of the way to your pattern again.
And that's an informal way of presenting it -- that's why there's a difference.
Another way of thinking about it --
if we tossed a coin eight million times,
then we'd expect a million head-tail-heads
and a million head-tail-tails -- but the head-tail-heads could occur in clumps.
So if you want to put a million things down amongst eight million positions
and you can have some of them overlapping, the clumps will be further apart.
It's another way of getting the intuition.
It's a very, very simple example, an easily stated question in probability,
which every -- you're in good company -- everybody gets wrong.
This is my little diversion into my real passion, which is genetics.
There's a connection between head-tail-heads and head-tail-tails in genetics,
and it's the following.
When you toss a coin, you get a sequence of heads and tails.
When you look at DNA, there's a sequence of not two things -- heads and tails --
but four letters -- As, Gs, Cs and Ts.
And there are little chemical scissors, called restriction enzymes
which cut DNA whenever they see particular patterns.
And they're an enormously useful tool in modern molecular biology.
And instead of asking the question, "How long until I see a head-tail-head?" --
you can ask, "How big will the chunks be when I use a restriction enzyme
which cuts whenever it sees G-A-A-G, for example?
How long will those chunks be?"
There's a much deeper connection, which I don't have time to go into
and that is that modern genetics is a really exciting area of science.
And we'll hear some talks later in the conference specifically about that.
But it turns out that unlocking the secrets in the information generated by modern
experimental technologies, a key part of that has to do with fairly sophisticated --
you'll be relieved to know that I do something useful in my day job,
rather more sophisticated than the head-tail-head story --
but quite sophisticated computer modelings and mathematical modelings
and modern statistical techniques.
And I will give you two little snippets -- two examples --
of projects we're involved in in my group in Oxford,
both of which I think are rather exciting.
You know about the Human Genome Project.
That was a project which aimed to read one copy of the human genome.
The natural thing to do after you've done that --
and that's what this project, the International HapMap Project,
which is a collaboration between labs in five or six different countries.
Think of the Human Genome Project as learning what we've got in common,
and the HapMap Project is trying to understand
where there are differences between different people.
Well, there are lots of reasons.
The most pressing one is that we want to understand how some differences
make some people susceptible to one disease -- type-2 diabetes, for example --
and other differences make people more susceptible to heart disease,
or stroke, or autism and so on.
That's one big project.
There's a second big project,
recently funded by the Wellcome Trust in this country,
involving very large studies --
thousands of individuals, with each of eight different diseases,
common diseases like type-1 and type-2 diabetes, and coronary heart disease,
bipolar disease and so on -- to try and understand the genetics.
To try and understand what it is about genetic differences that causes the diseases.
Why do we want to do that?
Because we understand very little about most human diseases.
We don't know what causes them.
And if we can get in at the bottom and understand the genetics,
we'll have a window on the way the disease works,
and a whole new way about thinking about disease therapies
and preventative treatment and so on.
So that's, as I said, the little diversion on my main love.
Here's another quiz for you --
now suppose we've got a test for a disease
which isn't infallible, but it's pretty good.
It gets it right 99 percent of the time.
And I take one of you, or I take someone off the street,
and I test them for the disease in question.
Let's suppose there's a test for HIV -- the virus that causes AIDS --
and the test says the person has the disease.
What's the chance that they do?
The test gets it right 99 percent of the time.
So a natural answer is 99 percent.
Who likes that answer?
Come on -- everyone's got to get involved.
Don't think you don't trust me anymore.
(Laughter)
Well, you're right to be a bit skeptical, because that's not the answer.
That's what you might think.
It's not the answer, and it's not because it's only part of the story.
It actually depends on how common or how rare the disease is.
So let me try and illustrate that.
Here's a little caricature of a million individuals.
So let's think about a disease that affects --
it's pretty rare, it affects one person in 10,000.
Amongst these million individuals, most of them are healthy
and some of them will have the disease.
And in fact, if this is the prevalence of the disease,
about 100 will have the disease and the rest won't.
So now suppose we test them all.
What happens?
Well, amongst the 100 who do have the disease,
the test will get it right 99 percent of the time, and 99 will test positive.
Amongst all these other people who don't have the disease,
the test will get it right 99 percent of the time.
It'll only get it wrong one percent of the time.
But there are so many of them that there'll be an enormous number of false positives.
Put that another way --
of all of them who test positive -- so here they are, the individuals involved --
less than one in 100 actually have the disease.
So even though we think the test is accurate, the important part of the story is
there's another bit of information we need.
What we have to do, once we know the test is positive,
is to weigh up the plausibility, or the likelihood, of two competing explanations.
Each of those explanations has a likely bit and an unlikely bit.
One explanation is that the person doesn't have the disease --
that's overwhelmingly likely, if you pick someone at random --
but the test gets it wrong, which is unlikely.
The other explanation is that the person does have the disease -- that's unlikely --
but the test gets it right, which is likely.
And the number we end up with --
that number which is a little bit less than one in 100 --
is to do with how likely one of those explanations is relative to the other.
Each of them taken together is unlikely.
Those of you in Britain will know about what's become rather a celebrated case
of a woman called Sally Clark, who had two babies who died suddenly.
And initially, it was thought that they died of what's known informally as "cot death,"
and more formally as "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome."
For various reasons, she was later charged with murder.
And at the trial, her trial, a very distinguished pediatrician gave evidence
that the chance of two cot deaths, innocent deaths, in a family like hers --
which was professional and non-smoking -- was one in 73 million.
To cut a long story short, she was convicted at the time.
Later, and fairly recently, acquitted on appeal -- in fact, on the second appeal.
And just to set it in context, you can imagine how awful it is for someone
to have lost one child, and then two, if they're innocent,
to be convicted of murdering them.
To be put through the stress of the trial, convicted of murdering them --
and to spend time in a women's prison, where all the other prisoners
think you killed your children -- is a really awful thing to happen to someone.
And it happened in large part here because the expert got the statistics
horribly wrong, in two different ways.
He looked at some research, which said the chance of one cot death in a family
like Sally Clark's is about one in 8,500.
So he said, "I'll assume that if you have one cot death in a family,
the chance of a second child dying from cot death aren't changed."
So that's what statisticians would call an assumption of independence.
It's like saying, "If you toss a coin and get a head the first time,
that won't affect the chance of getting a head the second time."
So if you toss a coin twice, the chance of getting a head twice are a half --
that's the chance the first time -- times a half -- the chance a second time.
So he said, "Here,
I'll assume that these events are independent.
When you multiply 8,500 together twice,
you get about 73 million."
And none of this was stated to the court as an assumption
or presented to the jury that way.
Unfortunately here -- and, really, regrettably --
first of all, in a situation like this you'd have to verify it empirically.
And secondly, it's palpably false.
There are lots and lots of things that we don't know about sudden infant deaths.
It might well be that there are environmental factors that we're not aware of,
and it's pretty likely to be the case that there are
genetic factors we're not aware of.
So if a family suffers from one cot death, you'd put them in a high-risk group.
They've probably got these environmental risk factors
and/or genetic risk factors we don't know about.
And to argue, then, that the chance of a second death is as if you didn't know
that information is really silly.
It's worse than silly -- it's really bad science.
Nonetheless, that's how it was presented, and at trial nobody even argued it.
That's the first problem.
The second problem is, what does the number of one in 73 million mean?
So after Sally Clark was convicted --
you can imagine, it made rather a splash in the press --
one of the journalists from one of Britain's more reputable newspapers wrote that
what the expert had said was,
"The chance that she was innocent was one in 73 million."
Now, that's a logical error.
It's exactly the same logical error as the logical error of thinking that
after the disease test, which is 99 percent accurate,
the chance of having the disease is 99 percent.
In the disease example, we had to bear in mind two things,
one of which was the possibility that the test got it right or not.
And the other one was the chance, a priori, that the person had the disease or not.
It's exactly the same in this context.
There are two things involved -- two parts to the explanation.
We want to know how likely, or relatively how likely, two different explanations are.
One of them is that Sally Clark was innocent --
which is, a priori, overwhelmingly likely --
most mothers don't kill their children.
And the second part of the explanation
is that she suffered an incredibly unlikely event.
Not as unlikely as one in 73 million, but nonetheless rather unlikely.
The other explanation is that she was guilty.
Now, we probably think a priori that's unlikely.
And we certainly should think in the context of a criminal trial
that that's unlikely, because of the presumption of innocence.
And then if she were trying to kill the children, she succeeded.
So the chance that she's innocent isn't one in 73 million.
We don't know what it is.
It has to do with weighing up the strength of the other evidence against her
and the statistical evidence.
We know the children died.
What matters is how likely or unlikely, relative to each other,
the two explanations are.
And they're both implausible.
There's a situation where errors in statistics had really profound
and really unfortunate consequences.
In fact, there are two other women who were convicted on the basis of the
evidence of this pediatrician, who have subsequently been released on appeal.
Many cases were reviewed.
And it's particularly topical because he's currently facing a disrepute charge
at Britain's General Medical Council.
Well, we know that randomness and uncertainty and chance
are very much a part of our everyday life.
It's also true -- and, although, you, as a collective, are very special in many ways,
you're completely typical in not getting the examples I gave right.
It's very well documented that people get things wrong.
They make errors of logic in reasoning with uncertainty.
We can cope with the subtleties of language brilliantly --
and there are interesting evolutionary questions about how we got here.
We are not good at reasoning with uncertainty.
That's an issue in our everyday lives.
As you've heard from many of the talks, statistics underpins an enormous amount
of research in science -- in social science, in medicine
and indeed, quite a lot of industry.
All of quality control, which has had a major impact on industrial processing,
is underpinned by statistics.
It's something we're bad at doing.
At the very least, we should recognize that, and we tend not to.
To go back to the legal context, at the Sally Clark trial
all of the lawyers just accepted what the expert said.
So if a pediatrician had come out and said to a jury,
"I know how to build bridges. I've built one down the road.
Please drive your car home over it,"
they would have said, "Well, pediatricians don't know how to build bridges.
That's what engineers do."
On the other hand, he came out and effectively said, or implied,
"I know how to reason with uncertainty. I know how to do statistics."
And everyone said, "Well, that's fine. He's an expert."
So we need to understand where our competence is and isn't.
Exactly the same kinds of issues arose in the early days of DNA profiling,
when scientists, and lawyers and in some cases judges,
routinely misrepresented evidence.
Usually -- one hopes -- innocently, but misrepresented evidence.
Forensic scientists said, "The chance that this guy's innocent is one in three million."
Even if you believe the number, just like the 73 million to one,
that's not what it meant.
And there have been celebrated appeal cases
in Britain and elsewhere because of that.
It's all very well to say, "Let's do our best to present the evidence."
But more and more, in cases of DNA profiling -- this is another one --
we expect juries, who are ordinary people --
and it's documented they're very bad at this --
we expect juries to be able to cope with the sorts of reasoning that goes on.
In other spheres of life, if people argued -- well, except possibly for politics --
but in other spheres of life, if people argued illogically,
we'd say that's not a good thing.
We sort of expect it of politicians and don't hope for much more.
In the case of uncertainty, we get it wrong all the time --
and at the very least, we should be aware of that,
and ideally, we might try and do something about it.
Thanks very much.
The odd one out is an astronomer, and I am one of that strange breed.
(Laughter)
My talk will be in two parts. I'll talk first as an astronomer,
and then as a worried member of the human race.
But let's start off by remembering that Darwin showed
how we're the outcome of four billion years of evolution.
And what we try to do in astronomy and cosmology
is to go back before Darwin's simple beginning,
to set our Earth in a cosmic context.
than what actually happened last Monday.
So that's another project for NASA.
That's Mars from the European Mars Express, and at New Year.
This artist's impression turned into reality
when a parachute landed on Titan, Saturn's giant moon.
It landed on the surface. This is pictures taken on the way down.
That looks like a coastline.
If we go beyond our solar system,
we've learned that the stars aren't twinkly points of light.
Each one is like a sun with a retinue of planets orbiting around it.
And we can see places where stars are forming,
And some stars die spectacularly in a supernova explosion,
leaving remnants like that.
We see entire ecosystems where gas is being recycled.
And to the cosmologist,
This picture shows a patch of sky
so small that it would take about 100 patches like it
to cover the full moon in the sky.
Through a small telescope, this would look quite blank,
but you see here hundreds of little, faint smudges.
Each is a galaxy, fully like ours or Andromeda,
which looks so small and faint because its light
has taken 10 billion light-years to get to us.
The stars in those galaxies probably don't have planets around them.
the building blocks of planets and of life.
We believe that all of this emerged from a Big Bang --
16 powers of 10 faster than real time,
which shows a patch of the universe where the expansions have subtracted out.
But you see, as time goes on in gigayears at the bottom,
And we'll end up after 13 billion years
And we compare simulated universes like that --
Well, we can trace things back to the earlier stages of the Big Bang,
but we still don't know what banged and why it banged.
If my research group had a logo, it would be this picture here:
the world of the quantum -- and on the right
the large-scale universe of planets, stars and galaxies.
We know our universes are united though --
And, as we've learned in the last few years, galaxies are held together
But we'd like to know the synthesis symbolized at the very top.
The micro-world of the quantum is understood.
On the right hand side, gravity holds sway. Einstein explained that.
But the unfinished business for 21st-century science
is to link together cosmos and micro-world
with a unified theory -- symbolized, as it were, gastronomically
at the top of that picture. (Laughter)
And until we have that synthesis,
we won't be able to understand the very beginning of our universe
because when our universe was itself the size of an atom,
which we don't yet have.
One idea, incidentally --
and I had this hazard sign to say I'm going to speculate from now on --
is that our Big Bang was not the only one.
One idea is that our three-dimensional universe
may be embedded in a high-dimensional space,
just as you can imagine on these sheets of paper.
You can imagine ants on one of them
thinking it's a two-dimensional universe,
not being aware of another population of ants on the other.
So there could be another universe just a millimeter away from ours,
but we're not aware of it because that millimeter
is measured in some fourth spatial dimension,
and we're imprisoned in our three.
And so we believe that there may be a lot more to physical reality
than what we've normally called our universe --
the aftermath of our Big Bang. And here's another picture.
Bottom right depicts our universe,
which on the horizon is not beyond that,
but even that is just one bubble, as it were, in some vaster reality.
Many people suspect that just as we've gone from believing
in one solar system to zillions of solar systems,
one galaxy to many galaxies,
we have to go to many Big Bangs from one Big Bang,
perhaps these many Big Bangs displaying
an immense variety of properties.
There's one challenge symbolized at the top,
but there's another challenge to science symbolized at the bottom.
You want to not only synthesize the very large and the very small,
We depend on stars to make the atoms we're made of.
We depend on chemistry to determine our complex structure.
to have layer upon layer of complex structure.
We clearly have to be small, compared to stars and planets --
otherwise we'd be crushed by gravity. And in fact, we are midway.
It would take as many human bodies to make up the sun
as there are atoms in each of us.
The geometric mean of the mass of a proton
and the mass of the sun is 50 kilograms,
within a factor of two of the mass of each person here.
Well, most of you anyway.
The science of complexity is probably the greatest challenge of all,
greater than that of the very small on the left
and the very large on the right.
And it's this science,
which is not only enlightening our understanding of the biological world,
but also transforming our world faster than ever.
And more than that, it's engendering new kinds of change.
and the book "Our Final Century" was mentioned.
If I was not a self-effacing Brit, I would mention the book myself,
and I would add that it's available in paperback.
because Americans like instant gratification.
not only has science changed the world faster than ever,
Targeted drugs, genetic modification, artificial intelligence,
perhaps even implants into our brains,
may change human beings themselves. And human beings,
their physique and character, has not changed for thousands of years.
It may change this century.
It's new in our history.
And the human impact on the global environment -- greenhouse warming,
mass extinctions and so forth -- is unprecedented, too.
And so, this makes this coming century a challenge.
Bio- and cybertechnologies are environmentally benign
in that they offer marvelous prospects,
while, nonetheless, reducing pressure on energy and resources.
But they will have a dark side.
In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower
just one fanatic,
or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses,
to trigger some kind on disaster.
Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure --
error rather than terror.
And even a tiny probability of catastrophe is unacceptable
when the downside could be of global consequence.
but it's interesting that he had a simple solution.
It was what he called "fine-grained relinquishment."
He wanted to give up the dangerous kind of science
and keep the good bits. Now, that's absurdly naive for two reasons.
First, any scientific discovery has benign consequences
as well as dangerous ones.
And also, when a scientist makes a discovery,
he or she normally has no clue what the applications are going to be.
And so what this means is that we have to accept the risks
if we are going to enjoy the benefits of science.
We have to accept that there will be hazards.
And I think we have to go back to what happened in the post-War era,
post-World War II, when the nuclear scientists
who'd been involved in making the atomic bomb,
who did the great work in relativity, but by the old Einstein,
the icon of poster and t-shirt,
who failed in his scientific efforts to unify the physical laws.
He was premature. But he was a moral compass --
an inspiration to scientists who were concerned with arms control.
And perhaps the greatest living person
is someone I'm privileged to know, Joe Rothblatt.
Equally untidy office there, as you can see.
He's 96 years old, and he founded the Pugwash movement.
He persuaded Einstein, as his last act,
to sign the famous memorandum of Bertrand Russell.
And he sets an example of the concerned scientist.
And I think to harness science optimally,
to choose which doors to open and which to leave closed,
we need latter-day counterparts of people like Joseph Rothblatt.
but we need biologists, computer experts
and environmentalists as well.
And I think academics and independent entrepreneurs
have a special obligation because they have more freedom
than those in government service,
or company employees subject to commercial pressure.
I wrote my book, "Our Final Century," as a scientist,
just a general scientist. But there's one respect, I think,
in which being a cosmologist offered a special perspective,
and that's that it offers an awareness of the immense future.
The stupendous time spans of the evolutionary past
are now part of common culture --
outside the American Bible Belt, anyway --
(Laughter)
but most people, even those who are familiar with evolution,
aren't mindful that even more time lies ahead.
but it'll be another six billion years before its fuel runs out.
And it'll be another six billion before that happens,
and any remaining life on Earth is vaporized.
There's an unthinking tendency to imagine that humans will be there,
experiencing the sun's demise,
but any life and intelligence that exists then
will be as different from us as we are from bacteria.
The unfolding of intelligence and complexity
still has immensely far to go, here on Earth and probably far beyond.
So we are still at the beginning of the emergence of complexity
in our Earth and beyond.
If you represent the Earth's lifetime by a single year,
say from January when it was made to December,
the 21st-century would be a quarter of a second in June --
a tiny fraction of the year.
But even in this concertinaed cosmic perspective,
our century is very, very special,
the first when humans can change themselves and their home planet.
it will not be humans who witness the end point of the sun;
it will be creatures as different from us as we are from bacteria.
When Einstein died in 1955,
one striking tribute to his global status was this cartoon
by Herblock in the Washington Post.
The plaque reads, "Albert Einstein lived here."
And I'd like to end with a vignette, as it were, inspired by this image.
We've been familiar for 40 years with this image:
the fragile beauty of land, ocean and clouds,
contrasted with the sterile moonscape
on which the astronauts left their footprints.
But let's suppose some aliens had been watching our pale blue dot
in the cosmos from afar, not just for 40 years,
but for the entire 4.5 billion-year history of our Earth.
What would they have seen?
Over nearly all that immense time,
Earth's appearance would have changed very gradually.
The only abrupt worldwide change
would have been major asteroid impacts or volcanic super-eruptions.
Apart from those brief traumas, nothing happens suddenly.
Ice cover waxed and waned.
Successions of new species emerged, evolved and became extinct.
But in just a tiny sliver of the Earth's history,
the last one-millionth part, a few thousand years,
the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before.
This signaled the start of agriculture.
Change has accelerated as human populations rose.
Then other things happened even more abruptly.
Within just 50 years --
that's one hundredth of one millionth of the Earth's age --
the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere started to rise,
and ominously fast.
the total output from all TV and cell phones
and radar transmissions. And something else happened.
Metallic objects -- albeit very small ones, a few tons at most --
escaped into orbit around the Earth.
Some journeyed to the moons and planets.
A race of advanced extraterrestrials
watching our solar system from afar
could confidently predict Earth's final doom in another six billion years.
But could they have predicted this unprecedented spike
less than halfway through the Earth's life?
These human-induced alterations
occupying overall less than a millionth of the elapsed lifetime
and seemingly occurring with runaway speed?
If they continued their vigil,
what might these hypothetical aliens witness
in the next hundred years?
Will some spasm foreclose Earth's future?
Or will the biosphere stabilize?
Or will some of the metallic objects launched from the Earth
spawn new oases, a post-human life elsewhere?
as long as our civilization, but for civilization to survive,
we'll need the wisdom of the old Einstein --
humane, global and farseeing.
And whatever happens in this uniquely crucial century
will resonate into the remote future and perhaps far beyond the Earth,
far beyond the Earth as depicted here.
Thank you very much.
I want to start with a story, a la Seth Godin,
from when I was 12 years old.
My uncle Ed gave me a beautiful blue sweater --
at least I thought it was beautiful.
And it had fuzzy zebras walking across the stomach,
and Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Meru were kind of
right across the chest, that were also fuzzy.
And I wore it whenever I could,
thinking it was the most fabulous thing I owned.
when I was standing with a number of the football players.
And my body had clearly changed, and Matt,
who was undeniably my nemesis in high school,
said in a booming voice that
we no longer had to go far away to go on ski trips,
but we could all ski on Mount Novogratz.
(Laughter)
And I was so humiliated and mortified
that I immediately ran home to my mother and chastised her
for ever letting me wear the hideous sweater.
We drove to the Goodwill and we threw the sweater away
somewhat ceremoniously,
my idea being that I would never have to think about the sweater
nor see it ever again.
I'm working in Kigali, Rwanda, jogging through the steep slopes,
when I see, 10 feet in front of me, a little boy -- 11 years old --
running toward me, wearing my sweater.
And I'm thinking, no, this is not possible.
But so, curious, I run up to the child -- of course
scaring the living bejesus out of him --
grab him by the collar, turn it over, and there is my name
written on the collar of this sweater.
as a metaphor to me about the level of connectedness
that we all have on this Earth.
We so often don't realize what our action and our inaction
does to people we think we will never see and never know.
I also tell it because it tells a larger contextual story
of what aid is and can be.
That this traveled into the Goodwill in Virginia,
and moved its way into the larger industry,
which at that point was giving millions of tons of secondhand clothing to Africa and Asia.
Which was a very good thing, providing low cost clothing.
And at the same time, certainly in Rwanda,
it destroyed the local retailing industry.
Not to say that it shouldn't have,
but that we have to get better at answering the questions
that need to be considered when we think about consequences
and responses.
where I was doing two things.
I had started a bakery with 20 unwed mothers.
We were called the "Bad News Bears," and our notion was
we were going to corner the snack food business in Kigali,
which was not hard because there were no snacks before us.
And because we had a good business model, we actually did it,
and I watched these women transform on a micro-level.
But at the same time, I started a micro-finance bank,
and tomorrow Iqbal Quadir is going to talk about Grameen,
which is the grandfather of all micro-finance banks,
which now is a worldwide movement -- you talk about a meme --
but then it was quite new, especially in an economy
that was moving from barter into trade.
We focused on a business model; we insisted on skin in the game.
The women made their own decisions at the end of the day
as to how they would use this access to credit
to build their little businesses, earn more income
so they could take care of their families better.
with the confluence of fear, ethnic strife
and certainly an aid game, if you will, that was playing into
this invisible but certainly palpable movement inside Rwanda,
that at that time, 30 percent of the budget was all foreign aid.
The genocide happened in 1994,
seven years after these women all worked together
to build this dream.
And the good news was that the institution,
the banking institution, lasted.
In fact, it became the largest rehabilitation lender in the country.
The bakery was completely wiped out,
but the lessons for me were that accountability counts --
got to build things with people on the ground,
using business models where, as Steven Levitt would say,
the incentives matter.
Understand, however complex we may be, incentives matter.
that was happening in the world,
that we were seeing a shift in zeitgeist,
on the one hand I absolutely agree with him,
and I was so thrilled to see what happened with the G8 --
that the world, because of people like Tony Blair and Bono
and Bob Geldof -- the world is talking about global poverty;
the world is talking about Africa
in ways I have never seen in my life.
It's thrilling.
And at the same time, what keeps me up at night
is a fear that we'll look at the victories of the G8 --
50 billion dollars in increased aid to Africa,
40 billion in reduced debt -- as the victory,
as more than chapter one, as our moral absolution.
celebrate it, close it, and recognize that we need a chapter two
that is all about execution, all about the how-to.
And if you remember one thing from what I want to talk about today,
it's that the only way to end poverty, to make it history,
is to build viable systems on the ground
that deliver critical and affordable goods and services to the poor,
in ways that are financially sustainable and scaleable.
If we do that, we really can make poverty history.
that encouraged me to start my current endeavor
called "Acumen Fund,"
which is trying to build some mini-blueprints
for how we might do that in water, health and housing
in Pakistan, India, Kenya, Tanzania and Egypt.
And I want to talk a little bit about that, and some of the examples,
so you can see what it is that we're doing.
But before I do this -- and this is another one of my pet peeves --
I want to talk a little bit about who the poor are.
Because we too often talk about them as these
strong, huge masses of people yearning to be free,
when in fact, it's quite an amazing story.
On a macro level, four billion people on Earth make less than four dollars a day.
If you aggregate it, it's the third largest economy on Earth,
and yet most of these people go invisible.
Where we typically work, there's people making between
one and three dollars a day.
Who are these people?
They are farmers and factory workers.
They work in government offices. They're drivers.
They are domestics.
They typically pay for critical goods and services like water,
like healthcare, like housing, and they pay 30 to 40 times
what their middleclass counterparts pay --
certainly where we work in Karachi and Nairobi.
The poor also are willing to make, and do make, smart decisions,
if you give them that opportunity.
One is in India, where there are 240 million farmers,
most of whom make less than two dollars a day.
Where we work in Aurangabad, the land is extraordinarily parched.
You see people on average making 60 cents to a dollar.
This guy in pink is a social entrepreneur named Ami Tabar.
What he did was see what was happening in Israel, larger approaches,
and figure out how to do a drip irrigation,
which is a way of bringing water directly to the plant stock.
But previously it's only been created for large-scale farms,
so Ami Tabar took this and modularized it down to an eighth of an acre.
A couple of principles:
build small.
Make it infinitely expandable and affordable to the poor.
when they were living in a -- literally a three-walled lean-to
with a corrugated iron roof.
After one harvest, they had increased their income enough
to buy a second system to do their full quarter-acre.
A couple of years later, I meet them.
They now make four dollars a day, which is pretty much middle class for India,
and they showed me the concrete foundation they had just laid
to build their house.
And I swear, you could see the future in that woman's eyes.
Something I truly believe.
and I again give Jeffrey Sachs of Harvard
huge kudos for bringing to the world
this notion of his rage -- for five dollars you can save a life.
Malaria is a disease that kills one to three million people a year.
300 to 500 million cases are reported.
It's estimated that Africa loses
about 13 billion dollars a year to the disease.
Five dollars can save a life.
We can send people to the moon; we can see if there's life on Mars --
why can't we get five-dollar nets to 500 million people?
The question is how can we help Africans do this for themselves?
A lot of hurdles.
One: production is too low. Two: price is too high.
Three: this is a good road in -- right near where our factory is located.
Distribution is a nightmare, but not impossible.
We started by making a 350,000-dollar loan
to the largest traditional bed net manufacturer in Africa
so that they could transfer technology from Japan
and build these long-lasting, five-year nets.
Here are just some pictures of the factory.
another thousand women.
It contributes about 600,000 dollars in wages to the economy of Tanzania.
It's the largest company in Tanzania.
The throughput rate right now is 1.5 million nets,
three million by the end of the year.
We hope to have seven million at the end of next year.
So the production side is working.
On the distribution side, though,
as a world, we have a lot of work to do.
Right now, 95 percent of these nets are being bought by the U.N.,
and then given primarily to people around Africa.
We're looking at building
on some of the most precious resources of Africa: people.
Their women.
my namesake, 21 years old.
If she were born anywhere else but Tanzania,
I'm telling you, she could run Wall Street.
She runs two of the lines, and has already saved enough money
to put a down payment on her house.
She makes about two dollars a day, is creating an education fund,
and told me she is not marrying nor having children
until these things are completed.
And so, when I told her about our idea --
that maybe we could take a Tupperware model from the United States,
and find a way for the women themselves to go out
and sell these nets to others --
she quickly started calculating what she herself could make
and signed up.
and quickly did a prototyping on this,
and took Jacqueline into the area where she lives.
She brought 10 of the women with whom she interacts
together to see if she could sell these nets, five dollars apiece,
despite the fact that people say nobody will buy one,
and we learned a lot about how you sell things.
Not coming in with our own notions,
because she didn't even talk about malaria until the very end.
First, she talked about comfort, status, beauty.
These nets, she said, you put them on the floor, bugs leave your house.
Children can sleep through the night;
the house looks beautiful; you hang them in the window.
And we've started making curtains,
and not only is it beautiful, but people can see status --
that you care about your children.
Only then did she talk about saving your children's lives.
A lot of lessons to be learned in terms of how we sell
goods and services to the poor.
to make poverty history.
To do it right, we have to build business models that matter,
that are scaleable and that work with Africans, Indians,
people all over the developing world
who fit in this category, to do it themselves.
Because at the end of the day, it's about engagement.
It's about understanding that people really don't want handouts,
that they want to make their own decisions;
they want to solve their own problems;
and that by engaging with them,
not only do we create much more dignity for them,
but for us as well.
And so I urge all of you to think next time
as to how to engage with this notion and this opportunity
that we all have -- to make poverty history --
by really becoming part of the process
and moving away from an us-and-them world,
and realizing that it's about all of us,
and the kind of world that we, together, want to live in and share.
Thank you.
(Applause)
still a very completely safe, stodgy type of encyclopedia.
all over the world in many, many languages.
It's written using wiki software --
which is the type of software he just demonstrated --
is to get a free encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
And so, if you think about what that means,
it means a lot more than just building a cool website.
empowering people everywhere to have the information that they need
to make good decisions.
And so that's a big part of why we've chosen the free licensing model,
The biggest languages are German, Japanese, French --
But only around one-third of all of our traffic to our web
clusters to the English Wikipedia,
All the editing is done by volunteers.
Time magazine recently reported that
that doesn't do us a damn bit of good of figuring out what to write,
because I don't agree with you about what's the truth.
But we have this jargon term of neutrality,
which has its own long history within the community,
which basically says, any time there's a controversial issue,
So this neutrality policy is really important for us
And then users can set up their own personal watch list.
So my page is on quite a few volunteers' watch lists,
tend to be pretty smart people.
This is an example of a page history on "flat Earth,"
made an edit to my page.
to see, OK, well, these words have changed, things like this.
Cases like that, the administrators just delete it.
There's no reason to have a big argument about it.
and the first person says,
So the next persons says, "Clean it up."
Like I say, it's a tight-knit community.
Down here at the bottom, "Keep, real movie," RickK.
these are the people who have the ability to delete pages.
to bias the content of the encyclopedia.
I always laugh at this, because I have no idea how they're elected, actually.
There's a certain amount of aristocracy.
because she's so admired and so powerful."
But the irony is, of course, that Angela can do this because she's the one person
who you know would never, ever break any rules of Wikipedia.
They always think they've got 40,000 members when they've got 18.
of giving an encyclopedia to every single person on the planet.
We don't mean we're going to Spam them with AOL-style CDs.
there's all kinds of innovation going on.
I'll just take you to Bangladesh for a minute.
Why does poverty exist?
I mean, there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs.
We all live in the same planet,
but there's still a great deal of poverty in the world.
And I think -- so I want to throw a perspective that I have,
so that we can assess this project, or any other project, for that matter,
to see whether it's contributing or --
contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it.
And by and large, this has failed.
And you can see this book,
written by someone who worked in the World Bank for 20 years,
and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive.
By and large, it did not work.
So the question is, why is that?
I mean, even here, yesterday I was walking across the street,
and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago,
right across the street from here.
So my point is, there's a lot of struggle has gone in Europe,
where citizens were empowered by technologies.
And they demanded authorities from --
to come down from their high horses.
And in the end, there's better bargaining
between the authorities and citizens,
and democracies, capitalism -- everything else flourished.
And so you can see, the real process of --
and this is backed up by this 500-page book --
that the authorities came down and citizens got up.
then you can see what happened in the last 60 years.
Aid actually did the opposite.
It empowered authorities,
and, as a result, marginalized citizens.
The authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen
so that they could tax people
and make more money for to run their business.
Because they were getting it from abroad.
And in fact, if you see oil-rich countries,
where citizens are not yet empowered, the same thing goes --
Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, all sorts of countries.
Because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way.
It empowers authorities, without activating the citizens --
their hands, legs, brains, what have you.
is to recognize that economic development is of the people,
by the people, for the people.
And that is the real network effect.
If citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive,
so that their voices are heard,
so then things would improve.
the World Bank, is an organization of the government,
by the government, for the governments.
Just see the contrast.
And that is the perspective I have, and then I can start my story.
There could be all sorts of technologies. And one is cell phones.
Recently "The Economist" recognized this,
but I stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago,
and that's what I've been working on.
So 12 years ago, I was trying to be an investment banker in New York.
And we got more productive because we didn't have to exchange floppy disks;
we could update each other more often.
But one time it broke down.
And it reminded me of a day in 1971.
There was a war going on in my country.
And my family moved out of an urban place, where we used to live,
to a remote rural area where it was safer.
And one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling.
And I walked 10 miles or so, all morning, to get there, to the medicine man.
And he wasn't there, so I walked all afternoon back.
So I had another unproductive day.
I put those two experiences together side by side,
and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity --
whether it's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village.
So naturally, I -- the implication of that is
that the telephone is a weapon against poverty.
And if that's the case, then the question is
how many telephones did we have at that time?
for every 500 people.
And all those phones were in the few urban places.
The vast rural areas, where 100 million people lived,
there were no telephones.
So just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted,
just like I wasted a day.
If you just multiply by 100 million people, let's say losing one day a month,
whatever, and you see a vast amount of resource wasted.
And after all, poor countries, like rich countries, one thing we've got equal,
is their days are the same length: 24 hours.
So if you lose that precious resource,
where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries,
that's a huge waste.
does connectivity really increase productivity?
And I couldn't find much, really, but I found this graph produced by the ITU,
which is the International Telecommunication Union, based in Geneva.
They show an interesting thing.
That you see, the horizontal axis is where you place your country.
So the United States or the UK would be here, outside.
And so the impact of one new telephone,
which is on the vertical axis, is very little.
let's say, 500 dollars, or 300 dollars,
then the impact is huge: 6,000 dollars. Or 5,000 dollars.
It turns out: 2,000 dollars.
So if you spend 2,000 dollars, and let's say the telephone lasts 10 years,
and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that's 50,000 dollars.
And of course, if the cost of installing a telephone is going down,
because there's a digital revolution going on,
then it would be even more dramatic.
it says Adam Smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity.
But how would you specialize?
Let's say I'm a fisherman and a farmer.
And Chris is a fisherman farmer. Both are generalists.
So the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other,
is if we can connect with each other.
And if we are neighbors, I could just walk over to his house.
But in order to expand that, you need a river,
or you need a highway, or you need telephone lines.
But in any event, it's connectivity that leads to dependability.
And that leads to specialization.
That leads to productivity.
and going back and forth between Bangladesh and New York.
There were a lot of reasons people told me
why we don't have enough telephones.
And one of them is the lacking buying power.
Poor people apparently don't have the power to buy.
I mean, in America, people buy cars,
and they put very little money down.
They get a car, and they go to work.
The work pays them a salary;
the salary allows them to pay for the car over time.
The car pays for itself.
then we don't quite have to worry about the purchasing power.
And of course, even if that's true, then what about initial buying power?
So then the question is, why can't we have some kind of shared access?
In the United States, we have -- everybody needs a banking service,
but very few of us are trying to buy a bank.
So it's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community.
So we could do that for telephones.
food, clothing, shelter, whatever.
But again, it's very paternalistic.
You should be raising income
and let people decide what they want to do with their money.
See, you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing.
For instance, the Internet was booming in the U.S.
because there were -- there were people who had computers.
They had modems.
They had telephone lines, so it's very easy to bring in a new idea, like the Internet.
But that's what's lacking in a poor country.
few banks to collect bills, etc.
But that's why I noticed Grameen Bank, which is a bank for poor people,
and had 1,100 branches, 12,000 employees, 2.3 million borrowers.
And they had these branches.
I thought I could put cell towers and create a network.
I first went to them and said,
"You know, perhaps I could connect all your branches and make you more efficient."
But you know, they have, after all, evolved in a country without telephones,
so they are decentralized. I mean, of course there might be other good reasons,
but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be.
And so they were not that interested to connect all their branches,
and then to be -- and rock the boat.
So what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank.
She typically buys a cow. The cow gives milk.
And she sells the milk to the villagers, and pays off the loan.
And this is a business for her, but it's milk for everybody else.
Because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank,
get a phone and have the phone for everybody.
And it's a business for her.
"It's a little crazy, but logical.
If you think it can be done, come and make it happen."
So I quit my job; I went back to Bangladesh.
I created a company in America called Gonofone,
which in Bengali means "people's phone."
I flew around the world.
After about a million -- I mean, I got rejected from lots of places,
because I was not only trying to go to a poor country,
I was trying to go to the poor of the poor country.
a substantial loss of hair, I eventually put together a consortium, and --
which involved the Norwegian telephone company,
which provided the know-how,
and the Grameen Bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service.
You can see it's pretty much covered.
Even in Bangladesh, there are some empty places.
But we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year
to extend that coverage.
There are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services
in their neighborhoods.
And it's serving 52,000 villages, which represent about 80 million people.
about 100 million dollars for the company.
And two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day, which is like 700 dollars per year.
It increases income, improves welfare, etc.
And the result is, right now, this company is the largest telephone company,
with 3.5 million subscribers,
115,000 of these phones I talked about --
that produces about a third of the traffic in the network.
And 2004, the net profit, after taxes --
very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars.
And the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers.
"The government needs to provide economically viable services."
Actually, this is an instance where private companies can provide that.
"Governments need to subsidize private companies."
This is what some people think.
And actually, private companies help governments with taxes.
"Poor people are recipients."
Poor people are a resource.
"Services cost too much for the poor."
Their involvement reduces the cost.
"The poor are uneducated and cannot do much."
They are very eager learners and very capable survivors.
I've been very surprised.
Most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day.
"Poor countries need aid."
Businesses -- this one company has raised the --
if the ideal figures are even five percent true, this one company
is raising the GNP of the country much more than the aid the country receives.
And as I was trying to show you, as far as I'm concerned,
aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens.
He has produced some power generators,
which we are now doing an experiment in Bangladesh,
in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas,
which is running these generators.
And each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each.
It's just an experiment.
We don't know how far it will go,
but it's going on.
We've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising.
So I'll try and do that,
and that is, that the planet Earth, or the solar system,
and inside is all we have, all we depend on,
and we only get the one chance: if we mess up our spaceship,
As Stephen Hawking famously said,
And the second one is saying that we're at a typical place.
you'll see the Sun, the solar system and the stars and so on,
And most places in the universe, a typical place in the universe,
is nowhere near any galaxies.
and yeah, there's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us.
But we're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe.
To get to a typical place,
And so, what does that look like -- "typical?"
and that star were to explode as a supernova,
and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you,
That's how big and how dark the universe is.
It's also very cold out there --
less than three degrees above absolute zero.
And that is how untypical this place is.
the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed
towards a supermassive black hole.
And then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy
It would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion,
Not just a superficial image of it, though it contains that as well,
the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other
So, the laws of physics have this special property,
that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be
Its structure contains, with ever-increasing precision,
acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe?
and there's no known way of making a computer without matter.
We also need energy to make the computer, and most important,
We happened to get round to testing, let's say, Newton's law of gravity,
about 300 years ago.
but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter.
And a million tons is enough to make, say, a self-contained space station,
if something isn't forbidden by the laws of physics,
then what could possibly prevent us from doing it, other than knowing how?
In other words, it's a matter of knowledge, not resources.
If we could do that, we'd automatically have an energy supply,
And locally there, you could build particle accelerators
and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry, and so on.
but I never did like biology field trips much --
So, we're not in a uniquely hospitable place.
from astrophysics, to scientific experiments gone wrong,
and most importantly, to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction.
namely, our special relationship with the laws of physics,
not because I want to advocate any particular solution,
because, if it's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent CO2 emissions
then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure.
And the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem,
It was probably already too late in the 1970s,
and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself,
can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee.
And it's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure,
but that's only if we know what to prevent.
then it would achieve very little of either.
and with plans to live at the higher temperature --
At the moment, these things are fringe research;
What I'm going to do, in the spirit of collaborative creativity,
is simply repeat many of the points
that the three people before me have already made,
but do them --
this is called "creative collaboration;"
it's actually called "borrowing" --
but do it through a particular perspective,
and that is to ask about the role of users and consumers
in this emerging world of
collaborative creativity
that Jimmy and others have talked about.
this simple question:
who invented the mountain bike?
Because traditional economic theory would say,
well, the mountain bike was probably invented by some big bike corporation
that had a big R&D lab
where they were thinking up new projects,
and it came out of there. It didn't come from there.
Another answer might be, well, it came from a sort of lone genius
working in his garage, who,
working away on different kinds of bikes, comes up
with a bike out of thin air.
came from users, came from young users,
particularly a group in Northern California,
who were frustrated with traditional racing bikes,
which were those sort of bikes that Eddy Merckx rode,
or your big brother, and they're very glamorous.
But also frustrated with the bikes that your dad rode,
which sort of had big handlebars like that, and they were too heavy.
So, they got the frames from these big bikes,
put them together with the gears from the racing bikes,
got the brakes from motorcycles,
and sort of mixed and matched various ingredients.
And for the first, I don't know, three to five years of their life,
mountain bikes were known as "clunkers."
And they were just made in a community of bikers,
mainly in Northern California.
for the clunkers decided to set up in business,
start selling them to other people,
and gradually another company emerged out of that, Marin,
and it probably was, I don't know,
10, maybe even 15, years,
before the big bike companies
realized there was a market.
Thirty years later,
mountain bike sales
and mountain bike equipment
account for 65 percent of bike sales in America.
That's 58 billion dollars.
that would not have been created by the mainstream bike market
because they couldn't see the need,
the opportunity;
they didn't have the incentive to innovate.
The one thing I think I disagree with
about Yochai's presentation
is when he said the Internet causes
this distributive capacity for innovation to come alive.
It's when the Internet combines
with these kinds of passionate pro-am consumers --
who are knowledgeable; they've got the incentive to innovate;
they've got the tools; they want to --
that you get this kind of explosion
of creative collaboration.
And out of that, you get the need for the kind of things
that Jimmy was talking about, which is our new kinds of organization,
or a better way to put it:
how do we organize ourselves without organizations?
That's now possible; you don't need an organization to be organized,
to achieve large and complex tasks,
like innovating new software programs.
to the way we think creativity comes about.
The traditional view, still enshrined
in much of the way that we think about creativity
-- in organizations, in government --
is that creativity is about special people:
wear baseball caps the wrong way round,
come to conferences like this, in special places,
elite universities, R&D labs in the forests, water,
maybe special rooms in companies painted funny colors,
you know, bean bags, maybe the odd table-football table.
Special people, special places, think up special ideas,
then you have a pipeline that takes the ideas
down to the waiting consumers, who are passive.
They can say "yes" or "no" to the invention.
That's the idea of creativity.
What's the policy recommendation out of that
if you're in government, or you're running a large company?
More special people, more special places.
Build creative clusters in cities;
create more R&D parks, so on and so forth.
Expand the pipeline down to the consumers.
I think it's always been wrong,
because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative,
and it's probably been largely interactive.
But it's increasingly wrong, and one of the reasons it's wrong
is that the ideas are flowing back up the pipeline.
The ideas are coming back from the consumers,
and they're often ahead of the producers.
Why is that?
Well, one issue
is that radical innovation,
when you've got ideas that
affect a large number of technologies or people,
have a great deal of uncertainty attached to them.
The payoffs to innovation are greatest
where the uncertainty is highest.
And when you get a radical innovation,
it's often very uncertain how it can be applied.
is a story of dealing with that uncertainty.
The very first landline telephones,
the inventors thought
that they would be used for people to listen in
to live performances
from West End theaters.
When the mobile telephone companies invented SMS,
they had no idea what it was for;
it was only when that technology got into the hands
of teenage users
that they invented the use.
the more the uncertainty,
the more you need innovation in use
to work out what a technology is for.
All of our patents, our entire approach
to patents and invention, is based on the idea
that the inventor knows what the invention is for;
we can say what it's for.
More and more, the inventors of things
will not be able to say that in advance.
It will be worked out in use,
in collaboration with users.
We like to think that invention is
a sort of moment of creation:
there is a moment of birth when someone comes up with an idea.
The truth is that most creativity
is cumulative and collaborative;
like Wikipedia, it develops over a long period of time.
is that they are the source of big, disruptive innovations.
If you want to find the big new ideas,
it's often difficult to find them in mainstream markets,
in big organizations.
And just look inside large organizations
and you'll see why that is so.
So, you're in a big corporation.
You're obviously keen to go up the corporate ladder.
Do you go into your board and say,
"Look, I've got a fantastic idea
for an embryonic product
in a marginal market,
with consumers we've never dealt with before,
and I'm not sure it's going to have a big payoff, but it could be really, really big in the future?"
No, what you do, is you go in and you say,
"I've got a fantastic idea for an incremental innovation
to an existing product we sell through existing channels
to existing users, and I can guarantee
you get this much return out of it over the next three years."
to reinforce past success.
They've got so much sunk in it
that it's very difficult for them to spot
emerging new markets. Emerging new markets, then,
are the breeding grounds for passionate users.
Best example:
who in the music industry,
30 years ago, would have said,
"Yes, let's invent a musical form
which is all about dispossessed black men
in ghettos expressing their frustration
with the world through a form of music
that many people find initially quite difficult to listen to.
That sounds like a winner; we'll go with it."
(Laughter).
So what happens? Rap music is created by the users.
They do it on their own tapes, with their own recording equipment;
they distribute it themselves.
30 years later,
rap music is the dominant musical form of popular culture --
would never have come from the big companies.
Had to start -- this is the third point --
with these pro-ams.
some stuff which I've done
with a think tank in London called Demos,
where we've been looking at these people who are amateurs --
i.e., they do it for the love of it --
but they want to do it to very high standards.
And across a whole range of fields --
from software, astronomy,
natural sciences,
vast areas of leisure and culture
like kite-surfing, so on and so forth --
you find people who want to do things because they love it,
but they want to do these things to very high standards.
They work at their leisure, if you like.
They take their leisure very seriously:
they acquire skills; they invest time;
they use technology that's getting cheaper -- it's not just the Internet:
cameras, design technology,
leisure technology, surfboards, so on and so forth.
Largely through globalization,
a lot of this equipment has got a lot cheaper.
More knowledgeable consumers, more educated,
more able to connect with one another,
more able to do things together.
Consumption, in that sense, is an expression
of their productive potential.
Why, we found, people were interested in this,
is that at work they don't feel very expressed.
They don't feel as if they're doing something that really matters to them,
so they pick up these kinds of activities.
This has huge organizational implications
for very large areas of life.
which Yochai has already mentioned.
Twenty years ago, 30 years ago,
only big professional astronomers
with very big telescopes could see far into space.
And there's a big telescope in Northern England called Jodrell Bank,
and when I was a kid, it was amazing,
because the moon shots would take off, and this thing would move on rails.
And it was huge -- it was absolutely enormous.
Now, six
amateur astronomers, working with the Internet,
with Dobsonian digital telescopes --
which are pretty much open source --
with some light sensors
developed over the last 10 years, the Internet --
they can do what Jodrell Bank could only do 30 years ago.
So here in astronomy, you have this vast explosion
of new productive resources.
The users can be producers.
organizational landscape?
Well, just imagine a world,
for the moment, divided into two camps.
Over here, you've got the old, traditional corporate model:
special people, special places;
patent it, push it down the pipeline
to largely waiting, passive consumers.
Over here, let's imagine we've got
Wikipedia, Linux, and beyond -- open source.
This is open; this is closed.
This is new; this is traditional.
Well, the first thing you can say, I think with certainty,
is what Yochai has said already --
is there is a great big struggle
between those two organizational forms.
These people over there will do everything they can
to stop these kinds of organizations succeeding,
because they're threatened by them.
And so the debates about
copyright, digital rights, so on and so forth --
these are all about trying to stifle, in my view,
these kinds of organizations.
What we're seeing is a complete corruption
of the idea of patents and copyright.
Meant to be a way to incentivize invention,
meant to be a way to orchestrate the dissemination of knowledge,
they are increasingly being used by large companies
to create thickets of patents
to prevent innovation taking place.
The first is: imagine yourself going to a venture capitalist
and saying, "I've got a fantastic idea.
I've invented this brilliant new program
that is much, much better than Microsoft Outlook."
Which venture capitalist in their right mind is going to give you any money to set up a venture
competing with Microsoft, with Microsoft Outlook? No one.
That is why the competition with Microsoft is bound to come --
will only come --
from an open-source kind of project.
about sustaining the capacity
for open-source and consumer-driven innovation,
because it's one of the greatest
competitive levers against monopoly.
There'll be huge professional arguments as well.
Because the professionals, over here
in these closed organizations --
they might be academics; they might be programmers;
they might be doctors; they might be journalists --
my former profession --
say, "No, no -- you can't trust these people over here."
Financial Times, 20 years ago --
it was very, very exciting
to see someone reading the newspaper.
And you'd kind of look over their shoulder on the Tube
to see if they were reading your article.
Usually they were reading the share prices,
and the bit of the paper with your article on
was on the floor, or something like that,
and you know, "For heaven's sake, what are they doing!
They're not reading my brilliant article!"
And we allowed users, readers,
two places where they could contribute to the paper:
the letters page, where they could write a letter in,
and we would condescend to them, cut it in half,
and print it three days later.
Or the op-ed page, where if they knew the editor --
had been to school with him, slept with his wife --
they could write an article for the op-ed page.
Those were the two places.
That's not their role; they're supposed to read what we write.
But they don't want to be journalists. The journalists think
that the bloggers want to be journalists;
they don't want to be journalists; they just want to have a voice.
They want to, as Jimmy said, they want to have a dialogue, a conversation.
They want to be part of that flow of information.
What's happening there is that the whole domain
of creativity is expanding.
So, there's going to be a tremendous struggle.
But, also, there's going to be tremendous movement
from the open to the closed.
and these, I think, are two challenges
for the open movement.
The first is:
can we really survive on volunteers?
If this is so critical,
do we not need it funded, organized, supported
in much more structured ways?
I think the idea of creating the Red Cross
for information and knowledge is a fantastic idea,
but can we really organize that, just on volunteers?
What kind of changes do we need in public policy
and funding to make that possible?
What's the role of the BBC,
for instance, in that world?
What should be the role of public policy?
And finally, what I think you will see
is the intelligent, closed organizations
moving increasingly in the open direction.
So it's not going to be a contest between two camps,
but, in between them, you'll find all sorts of interesting places
that people will occupy.
New organizational models coming about,
mixing closed and open in tricky ways.
It won't be so clear-cut; it won't be Microsoft versus Linux --
there'll be all sorts of things in between.
And those organizational models, it turns out,
are incredibly powerful,
and the people who can understand them
will be very, very successful.
of what that means.
I was in Shanghai,
in an office block
built on what was a rice paddy five years ago --
one of the 2,500 skyscrapers
they've built in Shanghai in the last 10 years.
And I was having dinner with this guy called Timothy Chan.
Timothy Chan set up an Internet business
in 2000.
Didn't go into the Internet, kept his money,
decided to go into computer games.
He runs a company called Shanda,
which is the largest computer games company in China.
Nine thousand servers all over China,
has 250 million subscribers.
At any one time, there are four million people playing one of his games.
How many people does he employ
to service that population?
500 people.
Well, how can he service
250 million people from 500 employees?
Because basically, he doesn't service them.
He gives them a platform;
he gives them some rules; he gives them the tools
and then he kind of orchestrates the conversation;
he orchestrates the action.
But actually, a lot of the content
is created by the users themselves.
And it creates a kind of stickiness
between the community and the company
which is really, really powerful.
you create a character
that you develop in the course of the game.
If, for some reason, your credit card bounces,
or there's some other problem,
you lose your character.
You've got two options.
One option: you can create a new character,
right from scratch, but with none of the history of your player.
That costs about 100 dollars.
Or you can get on a plane, fly to Shanghai,
queue up outside Shanda's offices --
cost probably 600, 700 dollars --
and reclaim your character, get your history back.
Every morning, there are 600 people queuing
outside their offices
to reclaim these characters. (Laughter)
So this is about companies built on communities,
that provide communities with tools,
resources, platforms in which they can share.
He's not open source,
but it's very, very powerful.
for people like me, who
do a lot of work with government.
If you're a games company,
and you've got a million players in your game,
you only need one percent of them
to be co-developers, contributing ideas,
and you've got a development workforce
of 10,000 people.
Imagine you could take all the children
in education in Britain, and one percent of them
were co-developers of education.
What would that do to the resources available
to the education system?
Or if you got one percent of the patients in the NHS
to, in some sense, be co-producers of health.
despite all the efforts to cut it down,
to constrain it, to hold it back --
why these open models will still start emerging
with tremendous force,
is that they multiply our productive resources.
And one of the reasons they do that
is that they turn users into producers,
consumers into designers.
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine
The official dogma of all Western industrial societies.
And the official dogma runs like this:
then each of us can act on our own
I want to say just a word about salad dressing.
A hundred seventy-five salad dressings in my supermarket,
if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy
to make a very large number of your own salad dressings,
in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.
speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier --
and in this one single consumer electronics store,
We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems
out of the components that are on offer in one store.
In other domains -- the world of communications.
There was a time, when I was a boy,
when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,
as long as it came from Ma Bell.
You rented your phone, you didn't buy it.
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,
especially in the world of cell phones.
My favorite is the middle one --
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.
And do you know what the answer to this question now is?
The answer is "no."
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.
that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.
Instead, you go to the doctor,
and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.
A has these benefits and these risks.
And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"
And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy,"
which makes it sound like a good thing,
to people like you and me,
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning
has now become a matter of choice,
as this slide is meant to indicate.
With respect to marriage and family:
not when, and not what you did after.
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,
and it's not because they're less diligent.
It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,
All of these are consuming questions.
And they're going to answer these questions,
that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.
"Should I answer this cell phone call?
it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game
big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,
That is to say, there were some choices,
but not everything was a matter of choice.
All of this choice has two effects,
With so many options to choose from,
people find it very difficult to choose at all.
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this,
a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.
of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.
Because with 50 funds to choose from,
it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,
that you'll just put it off till tomorrow,
and, of course, tomorrow never comes.
Understand that not only does this mean
that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.
By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year
And I think it makes the world look like this.
You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or wrong salad dressing.
we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice
than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.
One of them is, with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,
this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,
The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all
that is disappointing about the option that you chose.
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning
of talking about how much the way in which we value things
depends on what we compare them to.
Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,
that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.
"Damn it," this guy is thinking,
"It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.
and probably about doing things slowly.
But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing,
you're choosing not to do other things,
and you bought them, and they fit like crap.
They were incredibly uncomfortable,
I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones.
I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size."
Do you want boot cut, tapered?" Blah, blah, blah on and on he went.
"I want the kind that used to be the only kind."
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.
can't help but increase the expectations people have
about how good those options will be.
is that when everything was worse,
The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for --
that I actually am married to a wife,
and she's really quite wonderful.
But settling isn't always such a bad thing.
when there is only one kind to buy
and you ask why, who's responsible,
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you."
You could have done better.
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,
there is no excuse for failure.
they feel disappointed about them;
they blame themselves.
I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor
to this explosion of depression and also suicide,
is that people have experiences that are disappointing
because their standards are so high,
and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,
So let me remind you:
this is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,
There's no question that some choice is better than none.
There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point
where options improve our welfare.
as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:
There are lots of places in the world,
and we have heard about several of them,
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday
They actually hurt.
They actually make us worse off.
This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."
The more I thought about it, however,
the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.
Because the truth of the matter is,
You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.
This one is almost certainly too limited --
perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened
over the past six million years.
All right.
We all have come from a long way,
here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,
which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.
And I say that not because I am African,
but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence
for human ancestors, upright walking traces,
even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.
All right.
man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.
And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,
to tell you a story of all of us.
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl
who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.
You don't need to remember that.
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team
in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines
gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.
because that's what we do, to know about my host.
You don't just jump into an invitation.
And I learned that the first technology appeared
in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees
teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago
and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.
I think knowing this is a very useful context
within which we can think of our ancestry.
the beginning and the end, telling us nothing
about what happened in the middle.
So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,
the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap
and see the different stages of development.
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about --
(Laughter) --
it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about
how we looked like and how we behaved at different times,
and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.
That then gives you an access
to explore the biological mechanisms
and forces that are responsible for this gradual change
that made us what we are today.
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.
It's a systematic and scientific approach,
which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.
where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers
from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,
but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.
When you get there, this is what you see,
and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.
(Laughter)
And you find nothing for years and years.
it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.
But what you find are not the human remains,
such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.
But you could ask, how could these large mammals
live in this desert environment?
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already
that the environment and the carrying capacity
of this region was drastically different from what we have today.
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.
Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.
And our ancestors lived in that game park,
but were just the minorities. They were not as successful
and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.
I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,
and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.
They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."
Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.
You either don't know what you're looking for,
or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.
(Laughter)
And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,
and the people were scared and went somewhere else.
Let's go somewhere else."
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.
and you see the face here covered by sandstone.
And here is actually the spinal column
and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,
because she was buried by a river.
What you have here seems to be nothing,
but contains an incredible amount of scientific information
that helps us explore what makes us human.
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor
ever found in the history of paleoanthropology,
an amazing piece of our long, long history.
There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,
that's why I am not in.
but you are in the middle of nowhere?
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,
of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,
of making sure everything is safe.
preparation and description, which was very long,
as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block
I just showed you in the previous slide.
It took five years.
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,
but the labor was very long.
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,
who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child,
because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,
even a minister.
(Laughter)
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.
We were able to tell that she belonged
to the human family tree because the legs, the foot,
and some features clearly showed that she walked upright,
and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.
But in addition, if you compare the skull
with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,
you see that you have vertical forehead.
And you see that in humans, because of the development
of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.
You don't see that in chimpanzees,
and you don't see this very projecting canine.
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,
you do detailed analysis, and we know now
that she belongs to the Lucy species,
known as Australopithecus afarensis.
And how old was she when she died?
You can determine the sex of the individual
based on the size of the teeth.
How?
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon
called sexual dimorphism, which simply means
males are larger than females and males have larger teeth
than the females.
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition,
which you don't see here, because what you have here
are the baby teeth.
But using the CT scanning technology,
which is normally used for medical purposes,
you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image
showing you both the baby teeth here
and the still-growing adult teeth here.
So when you measure those teeth,
it was clear that she turned out to be a girl
with very small canine teeth.
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is
you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required
to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.
So, this girl died when she was about three,
3.3 million years ago.
what do we actually -- what does she tell us?
To answer this question, we can phrase another question.
What do we actually know about our ancestors?
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,
how they walked around,
and how they lived and grew up.
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton
are included: first, this skeleton documents,
for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.
but had some adaptation for tree climbing.
And more interesting, however,
is the brain in this child was still growing.
At age three, if you have a still-growing brain,
it's a human behavior.
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.
That's why they can cope with their environment
very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.
That's why we need care from our parents.
But that care means also you learn.
You spend more time with your parents.
And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,
which is this extended dependence of human children
on their family or parents.
So, the still-growing brain in this individual
tells us that childhood, which requires
an incredible social organization,
a very complex social organization,
emerged over three million years ago.
Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account
on what makes us human.
But not everything was human, and I will give you
a very exciting example.
This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.
It supports your tongue from behind.
It's, in a way, your voice box.
It determines the type of voice you produce.
It was not known in the fossil record,
and we have it in this skeleton.
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear
that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago,
to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,
she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.
What does that tell us?"
You know, that is very exciting for us,
because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,
and that evolution is in the making.
we can say the following.
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors
came essentially from adult individuals
because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.
They don't preserve well, as you know.
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,
on how they looked like, how they behaved,
was kind of biased toward adults.
Imagine somebody coming from Mars
and his job is to report on the type of people
occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,
the children, and he goes back and reports.
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?
That's what somehow we were doing so far
in the absence of the fossil children,
so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.
what do we actually learn from specimens like this
and from our past in general?
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount
of scientific information as to what makes us human,
you know, the many human ancestors that have existed
over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 --
they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications
that we, Homo sapiens, have today.
But if this species, ancient species,
would travel in time and see us today,
they would very much be very proud of their legacy,
because they became the ancestors of
the most successful species in the universe.
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy,
but they did great.
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today
are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?
And can we really do better than these primitive,
small-brained ancestors?
is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people
to talk about this.
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.
One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,
carrying guns, that depends on other people forever,
or to promote an Africa which is confident,
peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems
and great values at the same time.
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.
I am from Ethiopia, by the way --
we concentrate too much on how we are seen
from elsewhere, or from outside.
I think it's important to promote in a more positive way
on how we see ourselves.
That's what I call positive African attitude.
So finally, I would like to say,
so let's help Africa walk upright and forward,
then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.
Chris Anderson: William, hi. Good to see you.
and I read a book that would -- "Using Energy,"
and I get information about doing the mill.
And I tried, and I made it.
it has got four -- ah -- three blades,
and mine has got four blades.
What materials did you use?
so who's that?
what did they make of this? They were impressed?
to pump water and irrigation for crops.
to get people who might be able to help in some way
to realize this dream?
you're 19 now,
do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy?
Thank you so much for coming.
One of the problems of writing, and working, and looking at the Internet
is that it's very hard to separate fashion from deep change.
And so, to start helping that, I want to take us back to 1835.
In 1835, James Gordon Bennett founded the first mass-circulation newspaper
in New York City.
And it cost about 500 dollars to start it,
which was about the equivalent of 10,000 dollars of today.
By 15 years later, by 1850, doing the same thing
-- starting what was experienced as a mass--circulation daily paper
-- would come to cost two and a half million dollars.
10,000, two and a half million, 15 years.
That's the critical change that is being inverted by the Net.
And that's what I want to talk about today,
and how that relates to the emergence of social production.
for making information, knowledge and culture, which led to a stark bifurcation
between producers -- who had to be able to raise financial capital,
just like any other industrial organization --
and passive consumers that could choose from a certain set of
things that this industrial model could produce.
Now, the term "information society," "information economy,"
for a very long time has been used as the thing that comes after
the industrial revolution. But in fact, for purposes of understanding what's happening
today, that's wrong. Because for 150 years, we've had an information economy.
It's just been industrial,
which means those who were producing had to have a way of raising money
to pay those two and a half million dollars, and later, more for the telegraph,
and the radio transmitter, and the television, and eventually the mainframe.
And that meant they were market based, or they were government owned,
depending on what kind of system they were in. And this characterized and anchored
the way information and knowledge were produced for the next 150 years.
the world of supercomputers had a bombshell.
The Japanese had, for the first time, created the fastest supercomputer --
the NEC Earth Simulator -- taking the primary from the U.S.,
and about two years later -- this, by the way, is measuring the trillion floating-point
operations per second that the computer's capable of running --
sigh of relief: IBM [Blue Gene] has just edged ahead of the NEC Earth Simulator.
All of this completely ignores the fact that throughout this period,
there's another supercomputer running in the world -- SETI@home.
Four and a half million users around the world, contributing their
leftover computer cycles, whenever their computer isn't working,
by running a screen saver, and together sharing their resources to create
a massive supercomputer that NASA harnesses to analyze the data
coming from radio telescopes.
information production and exchange is capitalized. Not that it's become
less capital intensive -- that there's less money that's required
-- but that the ownership of this capital, the way the capitalization happens,
is radically distributed. Each of us, in these advanced economies,
has one of these, or something rather like it -- a computer.
They're not radically different from routers inside the middle of the network.
And computation, storage and communications capacity are in the hands of
practically every connected person -- and these are the basic physical
capital means necessary for producing information, knowledge and culture,
in the hands of something like 600 million to a billion people around the planet.
the most important means, the most important components of the core
economic activities -- remember, we are in an information economy
-- of the most advanced economies, and there more than anywhere else,
are in the hands of the population at large. This is completely different than what we've
seen since the industrial revolution. So we've got communications and computation
capacity in the hands of the entire population,
and we've got human creativity, human wisdom, human experience
-- the other major experience, the other major input --
which unlike simple labor -- stand here turning this lever all day long --
is not something that's the same or fungible among people.
Any one of you who has taken someone else's job, or tried to give yours
to someone else, no matter how detailed the manual, you cannot transmit
what you know, what you will intuit under a certain set of circumstances.
In that we're unique, and each of us holds this critical input
into production as we hold this machine.
is the story of free or open source software.
This is market share of Apache Web server
-- one of the critical applications in Web-based communications.
In 1995, two groups of people said,
"Wow, this is really important, the Web! We need a much better Web server!"
One was a motley collection of volunteers who just decided,
you know, we really need this, we should write one,
and what are we going to do with what --
well, we're gonna share it! And other people will be able to develop it.
The other was Microsoft.
anything that they produced, acquired 20 percent of the market
and was the red line, it would be amazing! Right?
Think of it in minivans. A group of automobile
engineers on their weekends are competing with Toyota. Right?
But, in fact, of course, the story is it's the 70 percent,
including the major e-commerce site -- 70 percent of a critical application
on which Web-based communications and applications work is produced in this form, in
direct competition with Microsoft. Not in a side issue --
in a central strategic decision to try to capture a component of the Net.
Software has done this in a way that's been very visible, because
it's measurable. But the thing to see is that this actually happens throughout the Web.
that they were mapping, and they said, instead of having three or four
fully trained Ph.D.s doing this all the time, let's break it up into small components,
put it up on the Web, and see if people, using a very simple interface,
will actually spend five minutes here,
10 minutes there, clicking. After six months,
85,000 people used this to generate mapping at a
faster rate than the images were coming in, which was, quote,
"practically indistinguishable from the markings of a fully-trained Ph.D.,"
once you showed it to a number of people and computed the average.
-- well, not so little, medium little -- tries to do research on Barbie.
And she'll come to Encarta, one of the main online encyclopedias.
This is what you'll find out about Barbie. This is it, there's nothing more to the definition,
including, "manufacturers" -- plural -- "now more commonly produce
ethnically diverse dolls, like this black Barbie." Which is vastly better
than what you'll find in the encyclopedia.com,
which is Barbie, Klaus. (Laughter)
On the other hand, if they go to Wikipedia, they'll find a genuine article
-- and I won't talk a lot about Wikipedia, because Jimmy Wales is here --
but roughly equivalent to what you would find in the Britannica, differently written,
including the controversies over body image and commercialization,
the claims about the way in which she's a good role model, etc.
The claim to fame of Yahoo! was, we hire people to look -- originally, not anymore
-- we hire people to look at websites and tell you --
passionate volunteers produce in the Open Directory Project,
each one willing to spend an hour or two on something they really care about,
to say, this is good. So, this is the Open Directory Project, with 60,000 volunteers,
each one spending a little bit of time, as opposed to a few hundred
fully paid employees. No one owns it, no one owns the output,
it's free for anyone to use and it's the output of people acting out of social
and psychological motivations to do something interesting.
of Google, the critical innovation is outsourcing the one most important thing --
the decision about what's relevant -- to the community of the Web as a whole,
doing whatever they want to do: so, page rank.
The critical innovation here is instead of our engineers, or our people saying
which is the most relevant, we're going to go out and count what you,
people out there on the Web, for whatever reason -- vanity, pleasure --
produced links, and tied to each other. We're going to count those, and count them up.
And again, here, you see Barbie.com, but also, very quickly,
Adiosbarbie.com, the body image for every size. A contested cultural object,
which you won't find anywhere soon on Overture, which is the classic
market-based mechanism: whoever pays the most is highest on the list.
But remember, the computers were also physical. Just physical materials
-- our PCs -- we share them together. We also see this in wireless.
It used to be wireless was one person owned the license, they transmitted in an
area, and it had to be decided whether they would be licensed or based on property.
What we're seeing now is that computers and radios are becoming so sophisticated
that we're developing algorithms to let people own machines, like Wi-Fi devices,
and overlay them with a sharing protocol that would allow a community like this
to build its own wireless broadband network simply from the simple principle:
When I'm listening, when I'm not using, I can help you transfer your messages;
and when you're not using, you'll help me transfer yours.
And this is not an idealized version. These are working models that at least in some
places in the United States are being implemented, at least for public security.
It's got to store terabytes. It's got to be available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week. It's got to be available from anywhere in the world.
It has to support over 100 million users at any given moment. It's got to
be robust to attack, including closing the main index, injecting malicious files,
armed seizure of some major nodes. You'd say that would take years.
It would take millions. But of course, what I'm describing is P2P file sharing.
Right? We always think of it as stealing music, but fundamentally,
it's a distributed data storage and retrieval system, where people,
for very obvious reasons, are willing to share their bandwidth and their
storage to create something.
framework. It used to be that there were two primary dimensions along which
you could divide things. They could be market based, or non-market based;
they could be decentralized, or centralized.
The price system was a market-based and decentralized system.
If things worked better because you actually had somebody organizing them,
you had firms, if you wanted to be in the market -- or you had governments
or sometimes larger non-profits in the non-market.
It was too expensive to have decentralized social production,
to have decentralized action in society. That was not about society itself.
That was, in fact, economic.
of social sharing and exchange.
Not that it's the first time that we do nice things to each other, or for each other,
as social beings. We do it all the time.
It's that it's the first time that it's having major economic impact.
What characterizes them is decentralized authority.
You don't have to ask permission, as you do in a property-based system.
May I do this? It's open for anyone to create and innovate and share,
if they want to, by themselves or with others,
because property is one mechanism of coordination.
But it's not the only one.
property and contract in the market: information flows to decide what are
interesting problems; who's available and good for something;
motivation structures -- remember, money isn't always the best motivator.
If you leave a $50 check after dinner with friends,
you don't increase the probability of being invited back.
And if dinner isn't entirely obvious, think of sex. (Laughter)
And in particular, what we've seen is task organization.
You have to hire people who know what they're doing.
You have to hire them to spend a lot of time.
Now, take the same problem,
chunk it into little modules, and motivations become trivial.
Five minutes, instead of watching TV?
Five minutes I'll spend just because it's interesting. Just because it's fun.
Just because it gives me a certain sense of meaning, or, in places that are more
involved, like Wikipedia, gives me a certain set of social relations.
It's creating, and it's most visible when we see it as a new form of competition.
Peer-to-peer networks assaulting the recording industry;
free and open source software taking market share from Microsoft;
Skype potentially threatening traditional telecoms;
Wikipedia competing with online encyclopedias.
But it's also a new source of opportunities for businesses.
As you see a new set of social relations and behaviors emerging,
you have new opportunities. Some of them are toolmakers.
Instead of building well-behaved appliances
-- things that you know what they'll do in advance --
you begin to build more open tools. There's a new set of values,
a new set of things people value.
You build platforms for self-expression and collaboration.
Like Wikipedia, like the Open Directory Project,
you're beginning to build platforms, and you see that as a model.
And you see surfers, people who see this happening, and in some sense
build it into a supply chain, which is a very curious one. Right?
That'll give me something I can use, and I'm going to contract with someone.
I will deliver something based on what happens. It's very scary
-- that's what Google does, essentially.
That's what IBM does in software services, and they've done reasonably well.
It is the critical long-term shift caused by the Internet.
Social relations and exchange become significantly more important than they ever
were as an economic phenomenon. In some contexts, it's even more efficient
because of the quality of the information, the ability to find the best person,
the lower transaction costs. It's sustainable and growing fast.
-- in the same way that it threatens -- the incumbent industrial systems.
So next time you open the paper, and you see an intellectual property decision,
a telecoms decision, it's not about something small and technical.
It is about the future of the freedom to be as social beings with each other,
and the way information, knowledge and culture will be produced.
Because it is in this context that we see a battle over how easy or hard it will be
for the industrial information economy to simply go on as it goes,
or for the new model of production to begin to develop alongside that industrial model,
Thank you.
it was the worst. It killed the most children.
but it was certainly better than what they had before.
And one of the good things about this cure was that it was free,
virtually free, and was very easy to use.
almost all of them ended up using it wrong in the end.
But what they did, of course, since it was so complicated and expensive,
they only used it on the zero-year-olds and the one-year-olds.
And they kept on using the existing cure that they had
And she thought to herself, "My child just turned two,
and until the child turned two, I had always used
this complicated, expensive cure, you know, this treatment.
And then the child turned two, and I started using
the cheap and easy treatment, and I wonder" --
And she told all the other people, and she said,
"How could it possibly be that something
that's cheap and simple works as well as something
that's complicated and expensive?"
And the people thought, "You know, you're right.
And the government, they heard her story and the other people,
and they said, "Yeah, you're right, we should make a law.
We should outlaw this cheap and simple treatment
and not let anybody use this on their children."
And the people were happy. They were satisfied.
But then along came a lowly economist, who had children himself,
and he used the expensive and complicated treatment.
didn't seem that great to him. So he thought,
"I don't know anything about science, but I do know something about data,
so maybe I should go and look at the data
and see whether this expensive and complicated treatment
actually works any better than the cheap and simple one."
And lo and behold, when he went through the data,
he found that it didn't look like the expensive, complicated
solution was any better than the cheap one,
at least for the children who were two and older --
the cheap one still didn't work on the kids who were younger.
it looks as if we could just use the cheap and simple solution,
and by doing so we could save ourselves 300 million dollars a year,
and we could spend that on our children in other ways."
And the parents were very unhappy, and they said,
"This is a terrible thing, because how can the cheap and easy thing
be as good as the hard thing?" And the government was very upset.
And in particular, the people who made this expensive solution
were very upset because they thought,
"How can we hope to compete with something that's essentially free?
We would lose all of our market."
And people were very angry, and they called him horrible names.
and come and try and tell the story at that place.
It's a true story about the United States today,
and the disease I'm referring to is actually
motor vehicle accidents for children.
And the free cure is adult seatbelts, and the expensive cure --
the 300-million-dollar-a-year cure -- is child car seats.
And what I'd like to talk to you about today
that has been devoted toward expanding the laws
and making it socially unacceptable
to put your children into seatbelts. And then talk about why --
about another technology, which is probably better than anything we have,
but which -- there hasn't been any enthusiasm for adoption
precisely because people are so enamored
with the current car seat solution. OK.
it records complicated stories -- it's hard to find in the data.
It doesn't turn out to be the case when you look at seatbelts versus car seats.
So the United States keeps a data set
of every fatal accident that's happened since 1975.
So in every car crash in which at least one person dies,
they have information on all of the people.
So if you look at that data -- it's right up on the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration's website --
you can just look at the raw data,
and begin to get a sense of the limited amount of evidence
that's in favor of car seats for children aged two and up.
So, here is the data. Here I have, among two- to six-year-olds --
anyone above six, basically no one uses car seats,
so you can't compare -- 29.3 percent of the children who are unrestrained
in a crash in which at least one person dies, themselves die.
If you put a child in a car seat, 18.2 percent of the children die.
16.7 percent die. And actually, the theory tells you
the same information, but turned into a figure to make it easier.
So the yellow bar represents car seats,
the orange bar lap-and-shoulder, and the red bar lap-only seatbelts.
And this is all relative to unrestrained --
the bigger the bar, the better. Okay.
So, this is the data I just showed, OK?
So the highest bar is what you're striving to beat.
So you can control for the basic things, like how hard the crash was,
what seat the child was sitting in, etc., the age of the child.
And that's that middle set of bars.
And so, you can see that the lap-only seatbelts
start to look worse once you do that.
And then finally, the last set of bars,
which are really controlling for everything
you could possibly imagine about the crash,
50, 75, 100 different characteristics of the crash.
when it comes to saving lives, fatalities look exactly identical.
And the standard error bands are relatively small around these estimates as well.
And it's not just overall. It's very robust
to anything you want to look at.
indeed, what you see is that the car seats look a little bit better.
And I think this isn't just chance.
"Well, car seats have got a lot better over time.
And so if we look at recent crashes --
the whole data set is almost 30 years' worth of data --
you won't see it in the recent crashes. The new car seats are far, far better."
And the line of argument, if you ask parents, is,
"But car seats are so expensive and complicated,
because they are so expensive and complicated?"
It's kind of an interesting logic,
I think, that people use. And the other logic, they say,
which has led to the passage of all these laws -- not very much on data.
So you can only get so far, I think, in telling your story
by using these abstract statistics.
And so I had some friends over to dinner, and I was asking --
we had a cookout -- I was asking them what advice they might have for me
they said they would be happy to do this test for us --
so anonymity, and 1,500 dollars per seat that we crashed.
And so, we went to Buffalo, New York,
and here is the precursor to it.
These are the crash test dummies,
waiting for their chance to take the center stage.
And then, here's how the crash test works.
Here, they don't actually crash the entire car, you know --
it's not worth ruining a whole car to do it.
So they just have these bench seats,
and they strap the car seat and the seatbelt onto it.
So I just wanted you to look at this.
it looks like he's already choking before the crash even happens.
It's hard to believe, when you look at this, that
that kid in back is going to do very well when you get in a crash.
So this is going to be a crash
These are three-year-old dummies, by the way.
So here -- this is the car seat. Now watch two things:
watch how the head goes forward,
The car seat's moving all over the place.
Bear in mind there are two things about this.
Having a flat back makes it much easier to install them.
And so this is a test that's very much rigged in favor of the car seat,
OK? So, that kid in this crash fared very well.
that you have to score below a 1,000
to be an approved car seat on this crash,
in some metric of units which are not important.
And this crash would have been about a 450.
So this car seat was actually an above-average car seat
from Consumer Reports, and did quite well.
So the next one. Now, this is the kid, same crash,
who is in the seatbelt. He hardly moves at all, actually,
relative to the other child. The funny thing is,
the cam work is terrible because they've only set it up
to do the car seats, and so, they actually don't even have a way
But still, if you just took that data from that crash
to the federal government, and said, "I have invented a new car seat.
I would like you to approve it for selling,"
then they would say, "This is a fantastic new car seat, it works great.
It only got a 500, it could have gotten as high up as a 1,000."
And this seatbelt would have passed with flying colors
into being approved as a car seat.
is that it's not just that people are setting up their car seats wrong,
which is putting children at risk. It's just that, fundamentally,
the car seats aren't doing much.
So here's the crash. So these are timed at the same time,
So, I'll show you the six-year-old crashes as well.
The six-year-old is in a car seat, and it turns out
that looks terrible, but that's great. That's like a 400, OK?
And then here's the six-year-old in the seatbelt,
and in fact, they get exactly within, you know,
within one or two points of the same. So really, for the six-year-old,
the car seat did absolutely nothing whatsoever.
I was criticized by a scientist, who said, "You could never publish
a study with an n of 4," meaning those four crashes.
So I wrote him back and I said, "What about an n of 45,004?"
of using real-world crashes, which is very much something
that economists think would be the right thing to do,
with children and with car seats.
is that there's a much better solution out there,
that's gotten nobody excited because everyone
is so delighted with the way car seats are presumably working.
And if you think from a design perspective,
about going back to square one, and say,
"I just want to protect kids in the back seat."
I don't there's anyone in this room who'd say,
"Well, the right way to start would be,
let's make a great seat belt for adults.
And then, let's make this really big contraption
that you have to rig up to it in this daisy chain."
I mean, why not start -- who's sitting in the back seat anyway except for kids?
But essentially, do something like this,
which I don't know exactly how much it would cost to do,
but there's no reason I could see
and it's got to work better than what we already have.
which would presumably save a lot of lives?
And I think the answer, perhaps, lies in a story.
The answer both to why has a car seat been so successful,
and why this may someday be adopted or not,
lies in a story that my dad told me, relating to when he was a doctor
in the U.S. Air Force in England. And this is a long time ago:
who he thought were not really sick.
And he had a big jar full of placebo pills that he would give them,
and he'd say, "Come back in a week, if you still feel lousy."
And when they came back, he, still convinced they were not sick,
had another jar of pills. In this jar were huge horse pills.
They were almost impossible to swallow.
And these, to me, are the analogy for the car seats.
People would look at these and say, "Man, this thing is so big
there was still a patient convinced that he was sick,
and he'd come back. And my dad had a third jar of pills.
And the jar of pills he had, he said,
were the tiniest little pills he could find,
so small you could barely see them.
but now I've got one that's so potent,
that is really tiny and small and almost invisible.
It's almost like this thing here, which you can't even see."
in all the times my dad gave out this pill, the really tiny pill,
did anyone ever come back still complaining of sickness.
So, my dad always took that as evidence
that this little, teeny, powerful pill
had the ultimate placebo effect. And in some sense, if that's the right story,
I think integrated car seats you will see, very quickly,
getting sent home with placebos, he still felt sick,
he went and found another doctor.
And that's completely possible. And if that's the case,
then I think we're stuck with conventional car seats for a long time to come.
Thank you very much.
we don't necessarily wear them just to prevent loss of life,
it's also to prevent lots of serious injury.
I find very small differences in injury.
So in this data, it's statistically insignificant differences
in injury between car seats and lap-and-shoulder belts.
but all crashes in New Jersey that are reported,
it turns out that there is a 10 percent difference in injuries,
but generally they're the minor injuries.
Now, what's interesting, I should say this as a disclaimer,
there is medical literature that is very difficult to resolve with this other data,
which suggests that car seats are dramatically better.
after the crash occurs, they get from the insurance companies
the names of the people who were in the crash,
and they call them on the phone,
and they asked them what happened.
And I really can't resolve, yet,
and I'd like to work with these medical researchers
to try to understand how there can be these differences,
which are completely at odds with one another.
But it's obviously a critical question.
The question is even if -- are there enough serious injuries
to make these cost-effective? It's kind of tricky.
Even if they're right, it's not so clear
Jambo, bonjour, zdravstvujtye, dayo: these are a few of the languages
that I've spoken little bits of over the course of the last six weeks,
as I've been to 17 countries I think I'm up to, on this crazy tour I've been doing,
checking out various aspects of the project that we're doing.
And I'm going to tell you a little bit about later on.
And visiting some pretty incredible places,
places like Mongolia, Cambodia, New Guinea, South Africa, Tanzania twice --
I was here a month ago.
is utterly amazing, for lots of reasons.
You see some incredible stuff.
And you get to make these spot comparisons
between people all around the globe.
And the thing that you really take away from that,
the kind of surface thing that you take away from it,
is not that we're all one, although I'm going to tell you about that,
but rather how different we are.
There is so much diversity around the globe.
6,000 different languages spoken by six and a half billion people,
all different colors, shapes, sizes.
You walk down the street in any big city, you travel like that,
Well, that's what I'm going to talk about today,
is how we're using the tools of genetics,
population genetics in particular, to tell us how we generated this diversity,
and how long it took.
Now, the problem of human diversity,
like all big scientific questions --
how do you explain something like that --
can be broken down into sub-questions.
And you can ferret away at those little sub-questions.
Do we all share a common origin, in fact?
And given that we do -- and that's the assumption
everybody, I think, in this room would make -- when was that?
When did we originate as a species?
How long have we been divergent from each other?
If we do spring from a common source,
how did we come to occupy every corner of the globe,
and in the process generate all of this diversity,
the different ways of life, the different appearances,
the different languages around the world?
seems to have been answered by Darwin over a century ago.
In "The Descent of Man," he wrote,
"In each great region of the world, the living mammals
are closely related to the extinct species of the same region.
It's therefore probable that Africa was formerly inhabited by extinct apes
closely allied to the gorilla and chimpanzee,
and as these two species are now man's nearest allies,
it's somewhat more probable that our early progenitors
lived on the African continent than elsewhere."
Well, not quite. Because Darwin was talking about our distant ancestry,
our common ancestry with apes.
And it is quite clear that apes originated on the African continent.
Around 23 million years ago, they appear in the fossil record.
Africa was actually disconnected from the other landmasses at that time,
due to the vagaries of plate tectonics, floating around the Indian Ocean.
Bumped into Eurasia around 16 million years ago,
and then we had the first African exodus, as we call it.
The apes that left at that time ended up in Southeast Asia,
became the gibbons and the orangutans.
And the ones that stayed on in Africa
evolved into the gorillas, the chimpanzees and us.
So, yes, if you're talking about our common ancestry with apes,
it's very clear, by looking at the fossil record, we started off here.
I'm asking about our human ancestry,
things that we would recognize as being like us
if they were sitting here in the room.
If they were peering over your shoulder,
you wouldn't leap back, like that. What about our human ancestry?
Because if we go far enough back,
we share a common ancestry with every living thing on Earth.
DNA ties us all together, so we share ancestry with barracuda
and bacteria and mushrooms, if you go far enough back -- over a billion years.
What we're asking about though is human ancestry.
How do we study that?
Digging things up out of the ground,
and largely on the basis of morphology --
the way things are shaped, often skull shape -- saying,
"This looks a little bit more like us than that, so this must be my ancestor.
This must be who I'm directly descended from."
gives us lots of fascinating possibilities about our ancestry,
but it doesn't give us the probabilities that we really want as scientists.
What do I mean by that?
You're looking at a great example here.
These are three extinct species of hominids,
potential human ancestors.
All dug up just west of here in Olduvai Gorge, by the Leakey family.
And they're all dating to roughly the same time.
From left to right, we've got Homo erectus, Homo habilis,
and Australopithecus -- now called Paranthropus boisei,
the robust australopithecine. Three extinct species, same place, same time.
That means that not all three could be my direct ancestor.
Which one of these guys am I actually related to?
Possibilities about our ancestry, but not the probabilities that we're really looking for.
using the only data that people really had at hand until quite recently --
again, largely skull shape.
The first person to do this systematically was Linnaeus,
Carl von Linne, a Swedish botanist,
who in the eighteenth century took it upon himself
to categorize every living organism on the planet.
You think you've got a tough job?
And he did a pretty good job.
He categorized about 12,000 species in "Systema Naturae."
He actually coined the term Homo sapiens -- it means wise man in Latin.
But looking around the world at the diversity of humans, he said,
"Well, you know, we seem to come in discreet sub-species or categories."
And he talked about Africans and Americans and Asians and Europeans,
and a blatantly racist category he termed "Monstrosus,"
which basically included all the people he didn't like,
including imaginary folk like elves.
but ultimately benighted musings of an eighteenth century scientist
working in the pre-Darwinian era.
Except, if you had taken physical anthropology
as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, in many cases you would have learned
basically that same classification of humanity.
Human races that according to physical anthropologists of 30, 40 years ago --
Carlton Coon is the best example --
had been diverging from each other -- this was in the post-Darwinian era --
for over a million years, since the time of Homo erectus.
But based on what data?
Very little. Very little. Morphology and a lot of guesswork.
what I'm going to talk about now is a new approach to this problem.
Instead of going out and guessing about our ancestry,
digging things up out of the ground, possible ancestors,
and saying it on the basis of morphology --
which we still don't completely understand,
we don't know the genetic causes underlying this morphological variation --
Because what we're really asking is a genealogical problem,
or a genealogical question.
What we're trying to do is construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
And as any genealogist will tell you --
anybody have a member of the family, or maybe you
have tried to construct a family tree, trace back in time?
You start in the present, with relationships you're certain about.
You and your siblings, you have a parent in common.
You and your cousins share a grandparent in common.
You gradually trace further and further back into the past,
adding these ever more distant relationships.
But eventually, no matter how good you are at digging up the church records,
and all that stuff, you hit what the genealogists call a brick wall.
A point beyond which you don't know anything else about your ancestors,
and you enter this dark and mysterious realm we call history
that we have to feel our way through with whispered guidance.
We have no written record. Well, actually, we do.
Written in our DNA, in our genetic code --
we have a historical document that takes us back in time
to the very earliest days of our species. And that's what we study.
I suspect that not everybody in the audience is a geneticist.
It is a very long, linear molecule, a coded version
of how to make another copy of you. It's your blueprint.
It's composed of four subunits: A, C, G and T, we call them.
And it's the sequence of those subunits that defines that blueprint.
How long is it? Well, it's billions of these subunits in length.
A haploid genome -- we actually have two copies of all of our chromosomes --
a haploid genome is around 3.2 billion nucleotides in length.
And the whole thing, if you add it all together,
is over six billion nucleotides long.
If you take all the DNA out of one cell in your body,
and stretch it end to end, it's around two meters long.
If you take all the DNA out of every cell in your body,
and you stretch it end to end, it would reach from here to the moon and back,
thousands of times. It's a lot of information.
Imagine the longest book you can think of, "War and Peace."
Now multiply it by 100.
And imagine copying that by hand.
And you're working away until late at night,
and you're very, very careful, and you're drinking coffee
and you're paying attention, but, occasionally,
when you're copying this by hand,
you're going to make a little typo, a spelling mistake --
substitute an I for an E, or a C for a T.
It doesn't happen very often. We have a proofreading mechanism built in.
But when it does happen, and these changes get transmitted down
through the generations, they become markers of descent.
If you share a marker with someone,
it means you share an ancestor at some point in the past,
the person who first had that change in their DNA.
And it's by looking at the pattern of genetic variation,
the pattern of these markers in people all over the world,
and assessing the relative ages when they occurred throughout our history,
that we've been able to construct a family tree for everybody alive today.
Mitochondrial DNA, tracing a purely maternal line of descent.
You get your mtDNA from your mother, and your mother's mother,
all the way back to the very first woman.
The Y chromosome, the piece of DNA that makes men men,
traces a purely paternal line of descent.
Everybody in this room, everybody in the world,
falls into a lineage somewhere on these trees.
Now, even though these are simplified versions of the real trees,
they're still kind of complicated, so let's simplify them.
Turn them on their sides, combine them so that they look like a tree
with the root at the bottom and the branches going up.
What's the take-home message?
is that the deepest lineages in our family trees
are found within Africa, among Africans.
That means that Africans have been accumulating
this mutational diversity for longer.
And what that means is that we originated in Africa. It's written in our DNA.
Every piece of DNA we look at has greater diversity within Africa than outside of Africa.
And at some point in the past, a sub-group of Africans
left the African continent to go out and populate the rest of the world.
Was it millions of years ago, which we might suspect
by looking at all this incredible variation around the world?
No, the DNA tells a story that's very clear.
Within the last 200,000 years, we all share an ancestor, a single person --
Mitochondrial Eve, you might have heard about her -- in Africa,
an African woman who gave rise to all the mitochondrial diversity in the world today.
is that if you look at the Y-chromosome side,
the male side of the story, the Y-chromosome Adam
only lived around 60,000 years ago.
That's only about 2,000 human generations,
the blink of an eye in an evolutionary sense.
That tells us we were all still living in Africa at that time.
This was an African man who gave rise
to all the Y chromosome diversity around the world.
It's only within the last 60,000 years
that we have started to generate this incredible diversity we see around the world.
Such an amazing story.
We're all effectively part of an extended African family.
Why didn't Homo erectus evolve into separate species,
or sub-species rather, human races around the world?
Why was it that we seem to have come out of Africa so recently?
Well, that's a big question. These "why" questions,
particularly in genetics and the study of history in general, are always the big ones,
the ones that are tough to answer.
What was going on to the world's weather around 60,000 years ago?
Well, we were going into the worst part of the last ice age.
The last ice age started roughly 120,000 years ago.
It went up and down, and it really started to accelerate around 70,000 years ago.
Lots of evidence from sediment cores
and the pollen types, oxygen isotopes and so on.
We hit the last glacial maximum around 16,000 years ago,
but basically, from 70,000 years on, things were getting really tough,
getting very cold. The Northern Hemisphere had massive growing ice sheets.
New York City, Chicago, Seattle, all under a sheet of ice.
Most of Britain, all of Scandinavia, covered by ice several kilometers thick.
about 85 percent of it lies between Cancer and Capricorn --
and there aren't a lot of glaciers here,
except on the high mountains here in East Africa.
So what was going on here? We weren't covered in ice in Africa.
Rather, Africa was drying out at that time.
This is a paleo-climatological map
of what Africa looked like between 60,000 and 70,000 years ago,
reconstructed from all these pieces of evidence that I mentioned before.
The reason for that is that ice actually sucks moisture out of the atmosphere.
If you think about Antarctica, it's technically a desert, it gets so little precipitation.
The sea levels were dropping. And Africa was turning to desert.
The Sahara was much bigger then than it is now.
And the human habitat was reduced to just a few small pockets,
compared to what we have today.
The evidence from genetic data
is that the human population around this time, roughly 70,000 years ago,
crashed to fewer than 2,000 individuals.
We nearly went extinct. We were hanging on by our fingernails.
Look at some stone tools.
The ones on the left are from Africa, from around a million years ago.
The ones on the right were made by Neanderthals, our distant cousins,
not our direct ancestors, living in Europe,
and they date from around 50,000 or 60,000 years ago.
Now, at the risk of offending any paleoanthropologists
or physical anthropologists in the audience,
basically there's not a lot of change between these two stone tool groups.
The ones on the left are pretty similar to the ones on the right.
We are in a period of long cultural stasis from a million years ago
until around 60,000 to 70,000 years ago.
The tool styles don't change that much.
The evidence is that the human way of life
didn't change that much during that period.
all hell breaks loose. Art makes its appearance.
The stone tools become much more finely crafted.
The evidence is that humans begin to specialize in particular prey species,
at particular times of the year.
The population size started to expand.
Probably, according to what many linguists believe,
fully modern language, syntactic language -- subject, verb, object --
that we use to convey complex ideas, like I'm doing now, appeared around that time.
We became much more social. The social networks expanded.
and they allowed us to start to expand around the world.
We've been talking at this conference about African success stories.
Well, you want the ultimate African success story?
Look in the mirror. You're it. The reason you're alive today
is because of those changes in our brains that took place in Africa --
probably somewhere in the region where we're sitting right now,
around 60, 70 thousand years ago --
allowing us not only to survive in Africa, but to expand out of Africa.
An early coastal migration along the south coast of Asia,
leaving Africa around 60,000 years ago,
reaching Australia very rapidly, by 50,000 years ago.
A slightly later migration up into the Middle East.
These would have been savannah hunters.
you'll get to see what a real savannah is like.
And it's basically a meat locker.
People who would have specialized in killing the animals,
hunting the animals on those meat locker savannahs, moving up,
following the grasslands into the Middle East around 45,000 years ago,
during one of the rare wet phases in the Sahara.
Migrating eastward, following the grasslands,
because that's what they were adapted to live on.
they reached what was effectively a steppe super-highway,
a grassland super-highway.
The grasslands at that time -- this was during the last ice age --
stretched basically from Germany all the way over to Korea,
and the entire continent was open to them.
Entering Europe around 35,000 years ago,
and finally, a small group migrating up
through the worst weather imaginable, Siberia,
inside the Arctic Circle, during the last ice age --
temperature was at -70, -80, even -100, perhaps --
migrating into the Americas, ultimately reaching that final frontier.
The changes that allowed us to do that,
the evolution of this highly adaptable brain that we all carry around with us,
allowing us to create novel cultures,
allowing us to develop the diversity
that we see on a whirlwind trip like the one I've just been on.
of how we populated the world, the great Paleolithic wanderings of our species.
And that's the story that I told a couple of years ago
in my book, "The Journey of Man," and a film that we made with the same title.
And as we were finishing up that film --
it was co-produced with National Geographic --
I started talking to the folks at NG about this work.
And they got really excited about it. They liked the film, but they said,
"You know, we really see this as kind of
the next wave in the study of human origins, where we all came from,
using the tools of DNA to map the migrations around the world.
You know, the study of human origins is kind of in our DNA,
and we want to take it to the next level.
What do you want to do next?"
Which is a great question to be asked by National Geographic.
It is a very coarse sketch of how we migrated around the planet.
And it's based on a few thousand people we've sampled from,
you know, a handful of populations around the world.
Studied a few genetic markers, and there are lots of gaps on this map.
We've just connected the dots. What we need to do
is increase our sample size by an order of magnitude or more --
hundreds of thousands of DNA samples from people all over the world."
The project launched in April 2005.
It has three core components. Obviously, science is a big part of it.
The field research that we're doing around the world with indigenous peoples.
People who have lived in the same location for a long period of time
retain a connection to the place where they live
that many of the rest of us have lost.
So my ancestors come from all over northern Europe.
I live in the Eastern Seaboard of North America when I'm not traveling.
Where am I indigenous to? Nowhere really. My genes are all jumbled up.
But there are people who retain that link to their ancestors
that allows us to contextualize the DNA results.
the centers that we've set up all over the world --
10 of them, top population geneticists.
But, in addition, we wanted to open up this study to anybody around the world.
How often do you get to participate in a big scientific project?
The Human Genome Project, or a Mars Rover mission.
You can go onto our website, Nationalgeographic.com/genographic.
You can order a kit. You can test your own DNA.
And you can actually submit those results to the database,
and tell us a little about your genealogical background,
have the data analyzed as part of the scientific effort.
after we cover the cost of doing the testing and making the kit components,
gets plowed back into the project.
The majority going to something we call the Legacy Fund.
It's a charitable entity, basically a grant-giving entity
that gives money back to indigenous groups around the world
for educational, cultural projects initiated by them.
They apply to this fund in order to do various projects,
and I'll show you a couple of examples.
collected from indigenous people around the world.
The most amazing thing has been the interest on the part of the public;
210,000 people have ordered these participation kits
since we launched two years ago,
which has raised around five million dollars,
the majority of which, at least half, is going back into the Legacy Fund.
Projects around the world -- documenting oral poetry in Sierra Leone,
preserving traditional weaving patterns in Gaza,
language revitalization in Tajikistan, etc., etc.
So the project is going very, very well,
and I urge you to check out the website and watch this space.
(Applause)
My mission in life since I was a kid was,
and is, to take the rest of you into space.
It's during our lifetime that we're going to take the Earth,
take the people of Earth and transition off, permanently. And that's exciting.
In fact, I think it is a moral imperative
that we open the space frontier.
You know, it's the first time that we're going to have a chance
to have planetary redundancy,
a chance to, if you would, back up the biosphere.
And if you think about space,
everything we hold of value on this planet --
metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space.
The analogy for me is Alaska. You know, we bought Alaska.
We Americans bought Alaska in the 1850s. It's called Seward's folly.
We valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill.
And then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber --
and it became, you know, a trillion-dollar economy,
and now we take our honeymoons there. The same thing will happen in space.
We are on the verge of the greatest exploration
that the human race has ever known.
the weakest of which is curiosity.
Some images from Mars, 1997.
In fact, I think in the next decade, without any question,
we will discover life on Mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous
under the soils and different parts of that planet.
It drove us to the moon. We -- literally in fear -- with the Soviet Union
raced to the moon. And we have these huge rocks,
you know, killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there,
and while the probability is very small,
the impact, figured in literally,
of one of these hitting the Earth is so huge
that to spend a small fraction looking, searching,
preparing to defend, is not unreasonable.
one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur, is wealth.
In fact, the greatest wealth. If you think about these other asteroids,
there's a class of the nickel iron,
which in platinum-group metal markets alone
are worth something like 20 trillion dollars,
if you can go out and grab one of these rocks.
My plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market,
and then actually claim that I'm going to go out and get one.
And that will fund the actual mission to go and get one.
But fear, curiosity and greed have driven us.
And for me, this is -- I'm the short kid on the right.
This was -- my motivation was actually during Apollo.
If you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s,
on May 25, JFK said, "We're going to go to the moon."
And people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations
to go and be part of this amazing mission.
And we knew nothing about going to space.
We went from having literally put Alan Shepard in suborbital flight
to going to the moon in eight years,
and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old.
They didn't know what couldn't be done.
They had to make up everything.
And that, my friend, is amazing motivation.
This is Gene Cernan, a good friend of mine, saying,
"If I can go to the moon" -- this is the last human on the moon so far --
"nothing, nothing is impossible." But of course,
we've thought about the government always as the person taking us there.
The government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier.
The shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch.
That's a pathetic number. It's unreasonable.
We shouldn't be happy in standing for that.
One of the things that we did with the Ansari X PRIZE
was take the challenge on that risk is OK, you know.
As we are going out there and taking on a new frontier,
we should be allowed to risk.
In fact, anyone who says we shouldn't, you know,
just needs to be put aside, because, as we go forward,
in fact, the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us.
The entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals,
and clearly the industrial-military complex --
with Boeing and Lockheed and NASA -- are the dinosaurs.
The ability for us to access these resources
to gain planetary redundancy --
we can now gather all the information, the genetic codes,
you know, everything stored on our databases,
and back them up off the planet,
in case there would be one of those disastrous situations.
Once you're in orbit, you are two thirds of the way, energetically, to anywhere --
the moon, to Mars. And today,
there's only three vehicles -- the U.S. shuttle, the Russian Soyuz
and the Chinese vehicle -- that gets you there.
Arguably, it's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle.
One of the companies I started, Space Adventures, will sell you a ticket.
We've done two so far. We'll be announcing two more on the Soyuz
to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars.
But that's expensive and to understand what the potential is --
You know, one -- we have a very unique period in time today.
For the first time ever, we have enough wealth
concentrated in the hands of few individuals
and the technology accessible
that will allow us to really drive space exploration.
But how cheap could it get? I want to give you the end point.
We know -- 20 million dollars today, you can go and buy a ticket,
but how cheap could it get?
If you calculate the amount of potential energy, mgh,
to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles,
and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour --
remember, that one half MV squared -- and you figure it out.
It's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy.
If you expended that over an hour, it's about 1.6 megawatts.
If you go to one of Vijay's micro-power sources,
and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour --
anybody here fast in math?
How much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit?
100 bucks. That's the price-improvement curve that --
we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way,
I'll grant you that.
it's that if you can imagine it, you will get there eventually.
I have no question that the physics,
the engineering to get us down to the point
where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner.
The difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment.
Today, the Boeings and the Lockheeds don't spend a dollar
of their own money in R&D.
It's all government research dollars, and very few of those.
And in fact, the large corporations,
the governments, can't take the risk.
So we need what I call an exothermic economic reaction in space.
Today's commercial markets worldwide, global commercial launch market?
12 to 15 launches per year.
Number of commercial companies out there? 12 to 15 companies.
One per company. That's not it. There's only one marketplace,
and I call them self-loading carbon payloads.
They come with their own money. They're easy to make.
It's people. The Ansari X PRIZE was my solution,
reading about Lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there.
carry three people up to 100 kilometers,
come back down, and within two weeks, make the trip again.
Twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition,
spending between one to 25 million dollars each.
And of course, we had beautiful SpaceShipOne,
which made those two flights and won the competition.
And I'd like to take you there, to that morning,
for just a quick video.
I declare that Mojave Aerospace Ventures
has indeed earned the Ansari X PRIZE.
was raise the capital for this. It was literally impossible.
We went -- I went to 100, 200 CEOs, CMOs.
No one believed it was done. Everyone said, "Oh, what does NASA think?
Well, people are going to die,
how can you possibly going to put this forward?"
I found a visionary family, the Ansari family, and Champ Car,
and raised part of the money, but not the full 10 million.
and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy.
See, the insurance companies went to Boeing and Lockheed,
and said, "Are you going to compete?" No.
"Are you going to compete?" No. "No one's going to win this thing."
So, they took a bet that no one would win by January of '05,
and I took a bet that someone would win.
and it's been a tremendous success.
One of the things I'm most happy about is that the SpaceShipOne
is going to hang in Air and Space Museum,
is going to be about 200,000.
make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate.
Here are some fun images. Here's Burt Rutan
and my good friend Greg Meronek inside a zero gravity --
but it's actually parabolic flight of an airplane.
Let me talk about the other thing I'm excited about.
The future of prizes. You know, prizes are a very old idea.
I had the pleasure of borrowing from the Longitude Prize
and the Orteig Prize that put Lindbergh forward.
and we just took on a new mission statement:
"to bring about radical breakthroughs in space
and other technologies for the benefit of humanity."
If you have a matching grant, it's typically two or three to one.
If you put up a prize, you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars.
So, we have actually -- are looking to turn the X PRIZE
into a world-class prize institute.
This is what happens when you put up a prize,
when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials.
You get publicity increase, and when it's won,
Then, when the prize is actually won, after it's moving,
you get societal benefits, you know, new technology, new capability.
And the benefit to the sponsors
is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term.
That's our value proposition in a prize.
and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome.
It may or may not happen. But if you put up a prize,
the beautiful thing is, you know, it's a very small maintenance fee,
and you pay on success.
You know, innovators, the entrepreneurs out there,
that you can do it yourself.
Then, you've got to, you know, face potential public ridicule
so that they can, in fact, help you raise the funds,
and then you've got to deal with the fact that you've got government bureaucracies
and institutions that don't want you to move those things forward,
is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things,
of how to come up with prizes and write the rules,
and we're actually looking at creating prizes
in a number of different categories.
We're looking at attacking energy, environment, nanotechnology --
and I'll talk about those more in a moment.
And the way we're doing that is we're creating prize teams
within the X PRIZE. We have a space prize team.
We're going after an orbital prize.
Craig Venter has just joined our board
and we're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him,
we'll be announcing later this fall,
about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody's DNA
for under 1,000 dollars, revolutionize medicine.
And clean water, education, medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship.
So my final slide here is, the most critical tool
for solving humanity's grand challenges -- it isn't technology,
it isn't money, it's only one thing --
it's the committed, passionate human mind.
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit,
so I'm going to dive straight in, right at the point
where I get this thing to work.
Here we go. I'm going to talk about five different things.
I'm going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable.
I'm going to talk about why we have to get our shit together,
and actually talk about this a bit more than we do.
I'm going to talk about feasibility as well, of course.
I'm going to talk about why we are so fatalistic
about doing anything about aging.
And then I'm going spend perhaps the second half of the talk
talking about, you know, how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong,
namely, by actually doing something about it.
The first one I'm going to talk about is
how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension --
which I'm going to define as 30 years, applied to people
who are already in middle-age when you start --
to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging.
Namely, essentially an elimination of the relationship between
how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year --
or indeed, to get sick in the first place.
And of course, the last thing I'm going to talk about
is how to reach that intermediate step,
that point of maybe 30 years life extension.
Now, I want to ask a question.
Hands up: anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria?
That was easy. OK.
OK. Hands up: anyone in the audience
who's not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing?
OK. So we all think malaria is a bad thing.
That's very good news, because I thought that was what the answer would be.
Now the thing is, I would like to put it to you
that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing
is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging.
And here is that characteristic.
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does.
to talk about the comparison with foxhunting,
which is something that was banned after a long struggle,
by the government not very many months ago.
I mean, I know I'm with a sympathetic audience here,
but, as we know, a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic.
And this is actually a rather good comparison, it seems to me.
You know, a lot of people said, "Well, you know,
city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time.
It's a traditional part of the way of life,
and we should be allowed to carry on doing it.
It's ecologically sound; it stops the population explosion of foxes."
But ultimately, the government prevailed in the end,
because the majority of the British public,
and certainly the majority of members of Parliament,
came to the conclusion that it was really something
that should not be tolerated in a civilized society.
all of these characteristics in spades.
What part of this do people not understand?
It's not just about life, of course --
(Laughter) --
it's about healthy life, you know --
getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun,
whether or not dying may be fun.
So really, this is how I would like to describe it.
It's a global trance.
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses
that people give for aging.
And, I mean, OK, I'm not actually saying
that these excuses are completely valueless.
There are some good points to be made here,
things that we ought to be thinking about, forward planning
so that nothing goes too -- well, so that we minimize
the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging.
remember your sense of proportion.
You know, these are arguments; these are things that
would be legitimate to be concerned about.
But the question is, are they so dangerous --
these risks of doing something about aging --
that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite,
namely, leaving aging as it is?
Are these so bad that they outweigh
condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death?
You know, if you haven't got an argument that's that strong,
then just don't waste my time, is what I say.
(Laughter)
that some people do think really is that strong, and here it is.
People worry about overpopulation; they say,
"Well, if we fix aging, no one's going to die to speak of,
or at least the death toll is going to be much lower,
only from crossing St. Giles carelessly.
And therefore, we're not going to be able to have many kids,
and kids are really important to most people."
And that's true.
And you know, a lot of people try to fudge this question,
and give answers like this.
I don't agree with those answers. I think they basically don't work.
I think it's true, that we will face a dilemma in this respect.
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate,
or a high death rate.
A high death rate will, of course, arise from simply rejecting these therapies,
in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids.
the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice.
What's not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future.
If we vacillate, hesitate,
and do not actually develop these therapies,
then we are condemning a whole cohort of people --
who would have been young enough and healthy enough
to benefit from those therapies, but will not be,
because we haven't developed them as quickly as we could --
we'll be denying those people an indefinite life span,
and I consider that that is immoral.
That's my answer to the overpopulation question.
now why should we get a little bit more active on this?
And the fundamental answer is that
the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks.
It's actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging.
Aging is ghastly, but it's inevitable, so, you know,
we've got to find some way to put it out of our minds,
and it's rational to do anything that we might want to do, to do that.
Like, for example, making up these ridiculous reasons
why aging is actually a good thing after all.
But of course, that only works when we have both of these components.
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear --
and we might be in range of doing something about aging --
this becomes part of the problem.
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things.
And that's why we have to really talk about this a lot --
evangelize, I will go so far as to say, quite a lot --
in order to get people's attention, and make people realize
that they are in a trance in this regard.
So that's all I'm going to say about that.
And the fundamental reason, I think, why we feel that aging is inevitable
is summed up in a definition of aging that I'm giving here.
A very simple definition.
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place,
which is to say, metabolism.
This is not a completely tautological statement;
it's a reasonable statement.
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars,
and it also happens to us,
despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms,
because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect.
basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next,
has side effects.
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology.
That's a fine definition. So we can put it this way:
we can say that, you know, we have this chain of events.
And there are really two games in town,
according to most people, with regard to postponing aging.
They're what I'm calling here the "gerontology approach" and the "geriatrics approach."
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day,
when pathology is becoming evident,
and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time,
and stop the accumulation of side effects
from causing the pathology quite so soon.
Of course, it's a very short-term-ist strategy; it's a losing battle,
because the things that are causing the pathology
are becoming more abundant as time goes on.
because, you know, prevention is better than cure.
But unfortunately the thing is that we don't understand metabolism very well.
In fact, we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work --
even cells we're not really too good on yet.
We've discovered things like, for example,
RNA interference only a few years ago,
and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work.
Basically, gerontology is a fine approach in the end,
but it is not an approach whose time has come
when we're talking about intervention.
So then, what do we do about that?
I mean, that's a fine logic, that sounds pretty convincing,
pretty ironclad, doesn't it?
Before I tell you why it isn't, I'm going to go a little bit
into what I'm calling step two.
Just suppose, as I said, that we do acquire --
let's say we do it today for the sake of argument --
the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life
on people who are already in middle age, let's say 55.
I'm going to call that "robust human rejuvenation." OK.
What would that actually mean
for how long people of various ages today --
or equivalently, of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive --
would actually live?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it's simple,
but it's not simple.
We can't just say, "Well, if they're young enough to benefit from these therapies,
then they'll live 30 years longer."
That's the wrong answer.
And the reason it's the wrong answer is because of progress.
for this purpose.
There are fundamental, major breakthroughs,
and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs.
Now, they differ a great deal
in terms of the predictability of time frames.
Fundamental breakthroughs:
very hard to predict how long it's going to take
to make a fundamental breakthrough.
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun,
and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it.
But after that, things were pretty steady and pretty uniform.
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened
in the progression of the technology of powered flight.
We can think, really, that each one is sort of
beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one, if you like.
The incremental advances have added up to something
which is not incremental anymore.
And you see it in all sorts of technologies.
Computers: you can look at a more or less parallel time line,
happening of course a bit later.
You can look at medical care. I mean, hygiene, vaccines, antibiotics --
you know, the same sort of time frame.
So I think that actually step two, that I called a step a moment ago,
isn't a step at all.
That in fact, the people who are young enough
to benefit from these first therapies
that give this moderate amount of life extension,
even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive,
will be at some sort of cusp.
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments
that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years.
In other words, they will be staying ahead of the game.
The therapies will be improving faster than
the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us.
Because, you know, most people, when they hear
that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more,
they think that I'm saying that we're going to invent therapies in the next few decades
that are so thoroughly eliminating aging
that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more.
I'm not saying that at all.
I'm saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies
will be enough.
They'll never be perfect, but we'll be able to fix the things
that 200-year-olds die of, before we have any 200-year-olds.
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on.
I decided to give this a little name,
which is "longevity escape velocity."
(Laughter)
Well, it seems to get the point across.
in terms of remaining life expectancy,
as measured by their health,
for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive.
If you're already 100, or even if you're 80 --
and an average 80-year-old,
we probably can't do a lot for you with these therapies,
because you're too close to death's door
for the really initial, experimental therapies to be good enough for you.
You won't be able to withstand them.
But if you're only 50, then there's a chance
that you might be able to pull out of the dive and, you know --
(Laughter) --
eventually get through this
and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense,
in terms of your youthfulness, both physical and mental,
and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes.
And of course, if you're a bit younger than that,
then you're never really even going
to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes.
we don't know how old that person is today,
because we don't know how long it's going to take
to get these first-generation therapies.
But irrespective of that age,
I'm claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 --
subject of course, to, you know, global catastrophes --
is actually, probably, only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old.
And that's quite a thought.
my last seven-and-a-half minutes, on step one;
namely, how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension
that will allow us to get to escape velocity?
And in order to do that, I need to talk about mice a little bit.
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation.
I'm calling it "robust mouse rejuvenation," not very imaginatively.
And this is what it is.
I say we're going to take a long-lived strain of mouse,
which basically means mice that live about three years on average.
We do exactly nothing to them until they're already two years old.
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them,
and with those therapies, we get them to live,
on average, to their fifth birthday.
So, in other words, we add two years --
we treble their remaining lifespan,
starting from the point that we started the therapies.
until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans?
Which we can now, as I've explained,
equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity.
Secondly, what does it mean for the public's perception
of how long it's going to take for us to get to those things,
starting from the time we get the mice?
And thirdly, the question is, what will it do
to actually how much people want it?
And it seems to me that the first question
is entirely a biology question,
and it's extremely hard to answer.
One has to be very speculative,
and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation,
that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more.
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this.
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame,
in order to give people a sense of proportion
so that they can assess their priorities.
So, I say that we have a 50/50 chance
of reaching this RHR milestone,
robust human rejuvenation, within 15 years from the point
that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation.
15 years from the robust mouse.
The public's perception will probably be somewhat better than that.
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are.
So they'll probably think it's five years away.
They'll be wrong, but that actually won't matter too much.
And finally, of course, I think it's fair to say
that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now
is the global trance I spoke about earlier, the coping strategy.
That will be history at this point,
because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans,
since it's been postponed so very effectively in mice.
So we're likely to end up with a very strong change in people's attitudes,
and of course that has enormous implications.
I'm going to add a little bit to my description of aging.
I'm going to use this word "damage"
to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism
and that eventually cause pathology.
Because the critical thing about this
is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology,
the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life, starting before we're born.
But it is not part of metabolism itself.
And this turns out to be useful.
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way.
We can say that, fundamentally, the difference between gerontology and geriatrics
is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate
at which metabolism lays down this damage.
And I'm going to explain exactly what damage is
in concrete biological terms in a moment.
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time
by stopping the damage converting into pathology.
And the reason it's a losing battle
is because the damage is continuing to accumulate.
We can call it the "engineering approach,"
and I claim that the engineering approach is within range.
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes.
It does not intervene in this process or this one.
And that's good because it means that it's not a losing battle,
and it's something that we are within range of being able to do,
because it doesn't involve improving on evolution.
The engineering approach simply says,
"Let's go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage --
not necessarily repair them completely, but repair them quite a lot,
so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold
that must exist, that causes it to be pathogenic."
We know that this threshold exists,
because we don't get age-related diseases until we're in middle age,
even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born.
The point about this slide is actually the bottom.
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging,
we will be here all night, because basically all of metabolism
is important for aging in one way or another.
This list is just for illustration; it is incomplete.
The list on the right is also incomplete.
It's a list of types of pathology that are age-related,
and it's just an incomplete list.
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete --
this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage,
side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end,
or that might cause pathology.
And there are only seven of them.
They're categories of things, of course, but there's only seven of them.
Cell loss, mutations in chromosomes, mutations in the mitochondria and so on.
Of course one can make a biological argument.
One can say, "OK, what are we made of?"
We're made of cells and stuff between cells.
What can damage accumulate in?
The answer is: long-lived molecules,
because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage, but then the molecule is destroyed --
like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone, too.
It's got to be long-lived molecules.
So, these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago
and that is pretty good news, because it means that,
you know, we've come a long way in biology in these 20 years,
so the fact that we haven't extended this list
is a pretty good indication that there's no extension to be done.
However, it's better than that; we actually know how to fix them all,
in mice, in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is,
we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade.
Some of them are partially implemented already, the ones at the top.
my conclusion is that, if we can actually get suitable funding for this,
then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years,
but we do need to get serious about it.
We do need to really start trying.
So of course, there are some biologists in the audience,
and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have.
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk,
but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff.
I've published a great deal on this;
I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based,
and there's quite a lot of detail there.
The detail is what makes me confident
of my rather aggressive time frames that I'm predicting here.
So if you think that I'm wrong,
you'd better damn well go and find out why you think I'm wrong.
who call themselves gerontologists because,
as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field,
you know, you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant
and not really to take it seriously.
So, you know, you've got to actually do your homework,
in order to understand whether this is true.
One thing is, you know, you'll be hearing from a guy in the next session
who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time,
and everyone said, "Well, it's obviously impossible."
And you know what happened.
So, you know, this does happen.
We have various strategies -- there's the Methuselah Mouse Prize,
which is basically an incentive to innovate,
and to do what you think is going to work,
and you get money for it if you win.
There's a proposal to actually put together an institute.
This is what's going to take a bit of money.
But, I mean, look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq?
Not very long. OK.
(Laughter)
It's got to be philanthropic, because profits distract biotech,
but it's basically got a 90 percent chance, I think, of succeeding in this.
And I think we know how to do it. And I'll stop there.
Thank you.
(Applause)
but I thought I would give people the chance.
Audience: Since you've been talking about aging and trying to defeat it,
why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man?
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate.
However, as far as I know, all the species have evolved to actually die,
so when cells divide, the telomerase get shorter, and eventually species die.
So, why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality,
when it is so advantageous, or is evolution just incomplete?
that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer.
I'm going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question,
which I happen to agree with,
which is that, no, aging is not a product of selection, evolution;
[aging] is simply a product of evolutionary neglect.
In other words, we have aging because it's hard work not to have aging;
you need more genetic pathways, more sophistication in your genes
in order to age more slowly,
and that carries on being true the longer you push it out.
So, to the extent that evolution doesn't matter,
doesn't care whether genes are passed on by individuals,
living a long time or by procreation,
there's a certain amount of modulation of that,
which is why different species have different lifespans,
but that's why there are no immortal species.
the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years.
If I project that, that would make me think
that I would live until 120 if I don't crash on my motorbike.
That means that I'm one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old?
(Laughter)
Your numbers are a bit out.
The standard numbers are that lifespans
have been growing at between one and two years per decade.
So, it's not quite as good as you might think, you might hope.
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible.
are actually in the human embryo,
and that the brain cells last 80 years or so.
If that is indeed true,
biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years,
as opposed to a typical, you know, couple of months?
Basically what we need to do is replace cells
in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate,
especially neurons, but we don't want to replace them
any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway,
because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function.
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on
was a little bit of an oversimplification.
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example --
but they do it by not having a nervous system --
and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function
on very long-lived cells.
A public, Dewey long ago observed,
is constituted through discussion and debate.
If we are to call the tyranny of assumptions into question,
and avoid doxa, the realm of the unquestioned,
then we must be willing to subject our own assumptions
to debate and discussion.
It is in this spirit that I join into a discussion
of one of the critical issues of our time,
namely, how to mobilize different forms of capital
for the project of state building.
capitalism, after 150 years, has become acceptable,
and so has democracy.
If we looked in the world of 1945
and looked at the map of capitalist economies and democratic polities,
they were the rare exception, not the norm.
The question now, however,
is both about which form of capitalism
and which type of democratic participation.
But we must acknowledge
that this moment has brought about
a rare consensus of assumptions.
And that provides the ground
for a type of action,
because consensus of each moment
allows us to act.
And it is necessary, no matter how fragile
or how provisional our consensus,
to be able to move forward.
neither benefits from capitalism
nor from democratic systems.
Most of the globe
experiences the state as repressive,
about denial of rights,
about denial of justice,
rather than provision of it.
And in terms of experience of capitalism,
there are two aspects
First, extractive industry.
timber,
that is cut right from under the poorest.
but it's the worst form
of -- today -- of the ugly face
of the developed world to the developing countries.
Tens of billions of dollars
are supposedly spent on building capacity
with people who are paid up to 1,500 dollars a day,
who are incapable
of thinking creatively,
or organically.
and of course the events of July 7,
I express my deep sympathy, and before that, September 11 --
have reminded us
we do not live in three different worlds.
We live in one world.
But that's easily said.
But we are not dealing with the implications
of the one world that we are living in.
And that is that if we want to have one world,
this one world cannot be based
on huge pockets of exclusion,
We must now finally come
of a truly global world,
in relationship to the regime of rights
and responsibilities and accountabilities
that are truly global in scope.
Otherwise we will be missing
this open moment in history,
where we have a consensus
on both the form of politics
and the form of economics.
We have three critical terms:
economy,
civil society
and the state.
I will not deal with those first two, except to say
that uncritical transfer of assumptions,
from one context to another,
can only make for disaster.
Economics
taught in most of the elite universities
are practically useless in my context.
My country is dominated
by drug economy and a mafia.
Textbook economics does not work in my context,
and I have very few recommendations from anybody
as to how to put together a legal economy.
The poverty of our knowledge
must become the first basis
of moving forward,
and not imposition of the framework
that works on the basis of mathematical modeling,
for which I have enormous respect.
My colleagues at Johns Hopkins were among the best.
instead of debating endlessly
about what is the structure of the state,
why don't we simplify
and say, what are a series of functions
that the state in the 21st century must perform?
Clare Lockhart and I are writing a book on this;
we hope to share that much widely with --
and third is that we could actually construct an index
to measure comparatively
how well these functions that we would agree on
are being performed in different places.
We propose 10.
And it's legitimate monopoly of means of violence,
administrative control, management of public finances,
investment in human capital, provision of citizenship rights,
provision of infrastructure,
management of the tangible and intangible assets of the state
through regulation, creation of the market,
international agreements, including public borrowing,
and then, most importantly, rule of law.
I hope the questions will give me an opportunity.
This is a feasible goal,
basically because, contrary to widespread assumption,
I would argue that we know how to do this.
Who would have imagined that Germany
would be either united or democratic today,
if you looked at it from the perspective of Oxford of 1943?
But people at Oxford prepared for a democratic Germany
and engaged in planning.
And there are lots of other examples.
we have to rethink the notion of capital.
The least important form of capital, in this project,
is financial capital -- money.
Money is not capital in most of the developing countries.
It's just cash.
Because it lacks the institutional,
organizational, managerial forms
to turn it into capital.
And what is required
is a combination of physical capital,
institutional capital, human capital --
and security, of course, is critical,
but so is information.
and that's the challenge
that I would like to pose to this group --
is again, it takes 16 years
in your countries
to produce somebody with a B.S. degree.
It takes 20 years
to produce somebody with a Ph.D.
The first challenge is to rethink,
fundamentally,
the issue of the time.
Do we need to repeat
the modalities that we have inherited?
Our educational systems are inherited from the 19th century.
What is it that we need to do fundamentally
to re-engage in a project,
that capital formation is rapid?
The absolute majority of the world's population
are below 20,
and they are growing larger and faster.
They need different ways
of being approached,
different ways of being enfranchised,
different ways of being skilled.
And that's the first thing.
but you're not engaging your global responsibility.
You've stayed away
from the problems of corruption.
You only want clean environments in which to function.
But if you don't think through the problems of corruption,
who will?
You stay away from design for development.
You're great designers,
but your designs are selfish.
It's for your own immediate use.
The world in which I operate
operates with designs
regarding roads, or dams,
or provision of electricity
that have not been revisited in 60 years.
This is not right. It requires thinking.
more than anything else from this group
is your imagination
to be brought to bear on problems
the way a meme is supposed to work.
As the work on paradigms, long time ago showed --
Thomas Kuhn's work --
it's in the intersection of ideas
that new developments --
true breakthroughs -- occur.
And I hope that this group
would be able to deal with the issue of state and development
and the empowerment of the majority of the world's poor,
through this means.
Thank you.
(Applause)
you were the finance minister of Afghanistan,
a country right at the middle
of much of the world's agenda.
Is the country gonna make it?
Will democracy flourish? What scares you most?
lack of your engagement.
(Laughter)
You asked me. You know I always give the unconventional answer.
No. But seriously,
the issue of Afghanistan
first has to be seen as,
at least, a 10- to 20-year perspective.
Today the world of globalization
is on speed.
Time has been compressed.
And space does not exist for most people.
But in my world --
you know, when I went back to Afghanistan after 23 years,
space had expanded.
Every conceivable form of infrastructure had broken down.
I rode -- traveled --
travel between two cities that used to take three hours
now took 12.
So the first is when the scale is that,
we need to recognize
that just the simple things that are infrastructure --
it takes six years to deliver infrastructure.
In our world.
Any meaningful sort of thing.
But the modality of attention,
or what is happening today, what's happening tomorrow.
when a country has been subjected
to one of the most immense, brutal forms of exercise of power --
we had the Red Army
for 10 continuous years,
110,000 strong,
literally terrorizing.
The sky:
every Afghan
sees the sky as a source of fear.
We were bombed
practically out of existence.
Then, tens of thousands of people were trained in terrorism --
from all sides.
The United States, Great Britain, joined for instance,
Egyptian intelligence service
to train thousands of people
in resistance and urban terrorism.
How to turn a bicycle
into an instrument of terror.
How to turn a donkey, a carthorse, anything.
And the Russians, equally.
So, when violence erupts
in a country like Afghanistan,
it's because of that legacy.
But we have to understand
that we've been incredibly lucky.
I mean, I really can't believe how lucky I am here,
standing in front of you, speaking.
When I joined as finance minister,
I thought that the chances of my living more than three years
would not be more than five percent.
Those were the risks. They were worth it.
and the reason we can make it
is because of the people.
You see, because, I mean -- I give you one statistic.
91 percent of the men in Afghanistan,
86 percent of the women,
listen to at least three radio stations a day.
In terms of their discourse,
in terms of their sophistication of knowledge of the world,
I think that I would dare say,
they're much more sophisticated
than rural Americans with college degrees
and the bulk of Europeans --
because the world matters to them.
And what is their predominant concern?
Abandonment.
Afghans have become deeply internationalist.
I had absolutely no desire to work with the Afghan government
because I'd lived as a nationalist.
And I told them -- my people, with the Americans here --
separate.
Yes, I have an advisory position with the U.N.
I went through 10 Afghan provinces very rapidly.
And everybody was telling me it was a different world.
You know, they engage.
They see engagement, global engagement,
as absolutely necessary to the future of the ordinary people.
And the thing that the ordinary Afghan is most concerned with is --
Clare Lockhart is here,
so I'll recite a discussion she had
with an illiterate woman in Northern Afghanistan.
And that woman said she didn't care
whether she had food on her table.
What she worried about was whether there was a plan for the future,
where her children could really have a different life.
That gives me hope.
CA: How is Afghanistan
going to provide alternative income
to the many people
who are making their living off the drugs trade?
instead of sending a billion dollars
on drug eradication
and paying it to a couple of security companies,
they should give this hundred billion dollars
to 50
of the most critically innovative companies in the world
to ask them to create one million jobs.
The key to the drug eradication is jobs.
Look, there's a very little known fact:
countries that have a legal average income per capita of 1,000 dollars
don't produce drugs.
Trade is the key, not aid.
The U.S. and Europe
should give us a zero percent tariff.
The textile industry is incredibly mobile.
If you want us to be able to compete with China and to attract investment,
we could probably attract
four to six billion dollars
quite easily in the textile sector,
if there was zero tariffs --
would create the type of job.
Cotton does not compete with opium;
a t-shirt does.
And we need to understand, it's the value chain.
Look, the ordinary Afghan is sick and tired
of hearing about microcredit.
It is important,
but what the ordinary women and men who engage in micro-production want
is global access.
They don't want to sell to the charity bazaars
that are only for foreigners --
and the same bloody shirt
embroidered time and again.
What we want is a partnership
with the Italian design firms.
Yeah, we have the best embroiderers in the world!
Why can't we do what was done with northern Italy?
With the Put Out system?
So I think economically,
the critical issue really is to now think through.
You know, the aid system is broken.
The aid system does not have the knowledge,
the vision, the ability.
I'm all for it; after all, I raised a lot of it.
Yeah, to be exact, you know,
I managed to persuade the world that
they had to give my country 27.5 billion.
They didn't want to give us the money.
It's that a dollar of private investment,
in my judgment,
is equal at least to 20 dollars of aid,
in terms of the dynamic that it generates.
Second is that one dollar of aid could be 10 cents;
it could be 20 cents;
or it could be four dollars.
It depends on what form it comes,
what degrees of conditionalities are attached to it.
You know, the aid system, at first, was designed to benefit
entrepreneurs of the developed countries,
not to generate growth in the poor countries.
And this is, again, one of those assumptions --
the way car seats are an assumption
that we've inherited in governments, and doors.
You would think that the US government
would not think that American firms needed subsidizing
to function in developing countries, provide advice,
but they do.
There's an entire weight of history
vis-a-vis aid
that now needs to be reexamined.
If the goal is to build states
that can credibly take care of themselves --
and I'm putting that proposition equally;
you know I'm very harsh on my counterparts --
aid must end
in each country in a definable period.
And every year there must be progress
on mobilization of domestic revenue
and generation of the economy.
Unless that kind of compact is entered into,
you will not be able to sustain the consensus.
I have a tough job to do.
You know, when I looked at the profile of the audience here,
with their connotations and design, in all its forms,
and with so much and so many people working
on collaborative and networks, and so on, that I wanted to tell you,
I wanted to build an argument for primary education
in a very specific context.
In order to do that in 20 minutes, I have to bring out four ideas --
it's like four pieces of a puzzle.
And if I succeed in doing that,
maybe you would go back with the thought
and the quality of education.
Now, by remoteness, I mean two or three different kinds of things.
Of course, remoteness in its normal sense, which means
that as you go further and further away
from an urban center, you get to remoter areas.
What happens to education?
The second, or a different kind of remoteness
is that within the large metropolitan areas all over the world,
you have pockets, like slums, or shantytowns, or poorer areas,
which are socially and economically remote
from the rest of the city, so it's us and them.
What happens to education in that context?
do not have good enough teachers.
If they do have, they cannot retain those teachers.
They do not have good enough infrastructure.
And if they had some infrastructure,
they have difficulty maintaining it.
we hired a car, looked up on Google,
found a route into northern India from New Delhi
which, you know, which did not cross any big cities
or any big metropolitan centers. Drove out about 300 kilometers,
and wherever we found a school, administered a set of standard tests,
and then took those test results and plotted them on a graph.
The graph was interesting, although you need to consider it carefully.
I mean, this is a very small sample; you should not generalize from it.
But it was quite obvious, quite clear,
that for this particular route that I had taken,
the remoter the school was, the worse its results seemed to be.
That seemed a little damning,
and I tried to correlate it with things like infrastructure,
or with the availability of electricity, and things like that.
It did not correlate with the size of classrooms.
It did not correlate with the quality of the infrastructure.
It did not correlate with the poverty levels. It did not correlate.
But what happened was that when I administered a questionnaire
to each of these schools, with one single question for the teachers -- which was,
"Would you like to move to an urban, metropolitan area?" --
69 percent of them said yes. And as you can see from that,
they say yes just a little bit out of Delhi,
and they say no when you hit the rich suburbs of Delhi --
because, you know, those are relatively better off areas --
and then from 200 kilometers out of Delhi, the answer is consistently yes.
I would imagine that a teacher who comes or walks into class
every day thinking that, I wish I was in some other school,
probably has a deep impact on what happens to the results.
So it looked as though teacher motivation and teacher migration
was a powerfully correlated thing with what was happening in primary schools,
as opposed to whether the children have enough to eat,
you know, things like websites, collaborative environments --
you've been listening to all that in the morning --
it's always piloted first in the best schools, the best urban schools,
and, according to me, biases the result.
The literature -- one part of it, the scientific literature --
consistently blames ET as being over-hyped and under-performing.
The teachers always say, well, it's fine, but it's too expensive for what it does.
Because it's being piloted in a school where the students are already getting,
let's say, 80 percent of whatever they could do.
You put in this new super-duper technology, and now they get 83 percent.
So the principal looks at it and says,
3 percent for 300,000 dollars? Forget it.
If you took the same technology and piloted it into one of those remote schools,
where the score was 30 percent, and, let's say, took that up to 40 percent --
that will be a completely different thing.
So the relative change that ET, Educational Technology, would make,
would be far greater at the bottom of the pyramid than at the top,
but we seem to be doing it the other way about.
the underprivileged first, not the other way about.
And finally came the question of, how do you tackle teacher perception?
the science fiction writer whom I met in Colombo,
and he said something which completely solves this problem.
He said a teacher than can be replaced by a machine, should be.
So, you know, it puts the teacher into a tough bind, you have to think.
where schools are not good enough, where teachers are not available
or where teachers are not good enough, for whatever reason.
If you happen to live in a part of the world where none of this applies,
then you don't need an alternative education.
but somewhere in the world people said, we don't have this problem,
because we have perfect teachers and perfect schools.
and a set of experiments which sort of led to this idea
of what might an alternative education be like.
They're called the hole-in-the-wall experiments.
I'll have to really rush through this. They're a set of experiments.
The first one was done in New Delhi in 1999.
And what we did over there was pretty much simple.
I had an office in those days which bordered a slum, an urban slum,
so there was a dividing wall between our office and the urban slum.
They cut a hole inside that wall --
which is how it has got the name hole-in-the-wall --
and put a pretty powerful PC into that hole, sort of embedded into the wall
so that its monitor was sticking out at the other end,
a touchpad similarly embedded into the wall,
put it on high-speed Internet, put the Internet Explorer there,
put it on Altavista.com -- in those days -- and just left it there.
So that was my office in IIT. Here's the hole-in-the-wall.
About eight hours later, we found this kid.
To the right is this eight-year-old child who --
and to his left is a six-year-old girl, who is not very tall.
And what he was doing was, he was teaching her to browse.
So it sort of raised more questions than it answered.
The last question is what everybody said, but you know,
I mean, they must have poked their head over the wall
and asked the people in your office,
can you show me how to do it, and then somebody taught him.
this time in a city called Shivpuri in the center of India,
where I was assured that nobody had ever taught anybody anything.
(Laughter)
So it was a warm day, and the hole in the wall
was on that decrepit old building. This is the first kid who came there;
he later on turned out to be a 13-year-old school dropout.
He came there and he started to fiddle around with the touchpad.
Very quickly, he noticed that when he moves his finger on the touchpad
something moves on the screen --
and later on he told me, "I have never seen a television
where you can do something."
So he figured that out. It took him over two minutes
to figure out that he was doing things to the television.
And then, as he was doing that, he made an accidental click
by hitting the touchpad -- you'll see him do that.
He did that, and the Internet Explorer changed page.
Eight minutes later, he looked from his hand to the screen,
and he was browsing: he was going back and forth.
When that happened, he started calling all the neighborhood children,
And by the evening of that day, 70 children were all browsing.
So eight minutes and an embedded computer
seemed to be all that we needed there.
that children in groups can self-instruct themselves
At this time there was a -- the main question was about English.
People said, you know, you really ought to have this in Indian languages.
So I said, have what, shall I translate the Internet
into some Indian language? That's not possible.
So, it has to be the other way about.
But let's see, how do the children tackle the English language?
I took the experiment out to northeastern India,
to a village called Madantusi,
where, for some reason, there was no English teacher,
so the children had not learned English at all.
And I built a similar hole-in-the-wall.
In the urban slums, the girls tend to stay away.
I left the computer there with lots of CDs -- I didn't have any Internet --
and came back three months later.
So when I came back there, I found these two kids,
eight- and 12-year-olds, who were playing a game on the computer.
And as soon as they saw me they said,
"We need a faster processor and a better mouse."
(Laughter)
I was real surprised.
You know, how on earth did they know all this?
And they said, "Well, we've picked it up from the CDs."
So I said, "But how did you understand what's going on over there?"
So they said, "Well, you've left this machine
which talks only in English, so we had to learn English."
So then I measured, and they were using 200 English words with each other
-- mispronounced, but correct usage --
words like exit, stop, find, save, that kind of thing,
not only to do with the computer but in their day-to-day conversations.
So, Madantusi seemed to show that language is not a barrier;
to see if these results are replicable, if they happen everywhere else.
India is a good place to do such an experiment in,
because we have all the ethnic diversities, all the -- you know,
the genetic diversity, all the racial diversities,
and also all the socio-economic diversities.
So, I could actually choose samples to cover a cross section
that would cover practically the whole world.
So I did this for almost five years, and this experiment
really took us all the way across the length and breadth of India.
This is the Himalayas. Up in the north, very cold.
I also had to check or invent an engineering design
which would survive outdoors, and I was using regular, normal PCs,
so I needed different climates, for which India is also great,
because we have very cold, very hot, and so on.
And you see here a little clip of -- one of these villages --
the first thing that these children did was to find a website
to teach themselves the English alphabet.
where humidity is a very big killer of electronics.
So we had to solve all the problems we had
without air conditioning and with very poor power,
so most of the solutions that came out used little blasts of air
put at the right places to keep the machines running.
I want to just cut this short. We did this over and over again.
This sequence is also nice. This is a small child, a six-year-old,
telling his eldest sister what to do.
in a connected environment,
irrespective of anything that we could measure.
So if they have access to the computer, they will teach themselves, including intelligence.
I couldn't find a single correlation with anything, but it had to be in groups.
And that may be of great, you know, interest to this group,
because all of you are talking about groups.
So here was the power of what a group of children can do,
if you lift the adult intervention.
We took standard statistical techniques, so I'm going to not talk about that.
But we got a clean learning curve,
almost exactly the same as what you would get in a school.
I'll leave it at that,
because, I mean, it sort of says it all, doesn't it?
What could they learn to do?
Basic Windows functions, browsing, painting, chatting and email,
games and educational material, music downloads, playing video.
In short, what all of us do.
And over 300 children will become computer literate
and be able to do all of these things in six months with one computer.
And surrounding him are usually three other children,
who are advising him on what they should do.
If you test them, all four will get the same scores in whatever you ask them.
Around these four are usually a group of about 16 children,
who are also advising, usually wrongly,
about everything that's going on on the computer.
And all of them also will clear a test given on that subject.
So they are learning as much by watching as they learn by doing.
It seems counter-intuitive to adult learning,
you know, don't touch the whiskey bottle.
So what does the eight-year-old do?
He observes very carefully how a whiskey bottle should be touched.
And if you tested him,
It was that primary education can happen on its own,
or parts of it can happen on its own.
It does not have to be imposed from the top downwards.
It could perhaps be a self-organizing system, so that was
the second bit that I wanted to tell you,
that children can self-organize and attain an educational objective.
I conducted a test over 500 children spread across all over India,
We got all sorts of opinions. Yes, no or I don't know.
I simply took those questions where I got 50 percent yeses and 50 percent noes --
so I was able to get a collection of 16 such statements.
These were areas where the children were clearly confused,
because half said yes and half said no.
A typical example being, "Sometimes it is necessary to tell lies."
They don't have a way to determine which way to answer this question;
So I leave you with this third question.
Can technology alter the acquisition of values?
Finally, self-organizing systems,
about which, again, I won't say too much
because you've been hearing all about it.
Natural systems are all self-organizing:
galaxies, molecules, cells, organisms, societies --
except for the debate about an intelligent designer.
But at this point in time, as far as science goes,
it's self-organization.
But other examples are traffic jams, stock market, society
And you know about the Internet-based self-organizing systems.
Remoteness affects the quality of education.
Educational technology should be introduced into remote areas first,
and other areas later.
Values are acquired; doctrine and dogma are imposed --
the two opposing mechanisms.
And learning is most likely a self-organizing system.
If you put all the four together, then it gives -- according to me --
it gives us a goal, a vision, for educational technology.
An educational technology and pedagogy that is digital, automatic,
fault-tolerant, minimally invasive, connected and self-organized.
As educationists, we have never asked for technology; we keep borrowing it.
PowerPoint is supposed to be considered a great educational technology,
but it was not meant for education, it was meant for making boardroom presentations.
We borrowed it. Video conferencing. The personal computer itself.
I think it's time that the educationists made their own specs,
and I have such a set of specs. This is a brief look at that.
And such a set of specs should produce the technology
to address remoteness, values and violence.
So I thought I'd give it a name -- why don't we call it "outdoctrination."
And could this be a goal for educational technology in the future?
Just to put everything in context,
and to kind of give you a background to where I'm coming from,
so that a lot of the things I'm going to say,
and the things I'm going to do --
or things I'm going to tell you I've done --
you will understand exactly why and how I got motivated to be where I am.
I graduated high school in Cleveland, Ohio, 1975.
And just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad, we went back home.
Finished university education, got a medical degree, 1986.
And by the time I was an intern house officer,
I could barely afford to maintain my mother's 13-year-old car --
and I was a paid doctor.
This brings us to why a lot of us, who are professionals,
are now, as they say, in diaspora.
Now, are we going to make that a permanent thing,
where we all get trained, and we leave, and we don't go back?
Perhaps not, I should certainly hope not --
because that is not my vision.
and just there is the Delta region that I'm sure everybody's heard of.
People getting kidnapped, where the oil comes from,
the oil that sometimes I think has driven us all crazy in Nigeria.
But, critical poverty: this slide is from a presentation I gave
not that long ago. Gapminder.org tells the story of the gap
between Africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care.
Very interesting.
And believe it or not, that is a taxi in Nigeria.
And the capital -- well, what used to be the capital of Nigeria -- Lagos,
that's a taxi, and you have police on them.
So, tell me, how many policemen do you think are on this taxi? And now? Three.
So, when these kind of people -- and, believe me, it's not just the police
that use these taxis in Lagos. We all do. I've been on one of these,
and I didn't have a helmet, either.
And it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us
on a taxi like this falls off, has an accident and needs a hospital.
Some of us do survive malaria; we do survive AIDS.
And like I tell my family, and my wife reminds me every time,
"You're risking your life, you know, every time you go to that country."
And she's right. Every time you go there,
you know that if you actually need critical care --
critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident --
of which there are many, there are accidents everywhere --
where do they go?
Where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff?
I'm not saying instead of, I'm saying as well as,
AIDS, TB, malaria, typhoid -- the list goes on.
I'm saying, where do they go when they're like me?
When I go back home -- and I do all kinds of things,
I teach, I train -- but I catch one of these things,
or I'm chronically ill with one of those, where do they go?
What's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled?
These are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden --
this is a major hospital. In fact, it's from a major teaching hospital in Nigeria.
Now that is less than a year old, in an operating room.
That's sterilizing equipment in Nigeria.
You remember all that oil?
Yes, I'm sorry if it upsets some of you, but
I think you need to see this. That's the floor, OK?
You can say some of this is education.
You can say it's hygiene. I'm not pleading poverty.
I'm saying we need more than just, you know, vaccination,
malaria, AIDS, because I want to be treated
in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there.
In fact, when I start running around saying,
"Hey, boys and girls, you're cardiologists in the U.S.,
can you come home with me and do a mission?"
I want them to think, "Well there's some hope."
And that's my specialty, right?
Anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag.
It's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the U.K.
And believe me, these are current pictures.
Now, if something like this, which has happened in the U.K.,
that's where they go. This is the intensive care unit in which I work.
about intensive care units in Nigeria,
and jokingly we refer to it as "Expensive Scare."
Because it's scary and it's expensive, but we need to have it, OK?
So, these are the problems.
There are no prizes for telling us what the problems are, are there?
I think we all know. And several speakers before
and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems.
These are a few of them. So, what did I do?
We're going to do some open-heart surgery. I was the only Brit,
on a team of about nine American cardiac surgeons,
cardiac nurse, intensive care nurse.
We all went out and did a mission and we've done three of them so far.
Just so you know, I do believe in missions, I do believe in aid
and I do believe in charity. They have their place,
but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier?
Because it's not everyone that's going to benefit from a mission.
Health is wealth, in the words of Hans Rosling.
You get wealthier faster if you are healthy first.
Open-heart surgery in Nigeria -- big trouble.
That's Mike, Mike comes out from Mississippi.
Does he look like he's happy?
It took us two days just to organize the place, but hey,
you know, we worked on it. Does he look happy?
Yes, that's the medical advice the committee chairman says,
"Yes, I told you, you weren't going to be able to,
you can't do this, I just know it."
Look, that's the technician we had. So yes, you go on, all right?
Yes, let's just go work this thing out.
See, that's one of the problems we have in Nigeria and in Africa generally.
We get a lot of donated equipment.
Equipment that's obsolete, equipment that doesn't quite work,
or it works and you can't fix it. And there's nothing wrong with that,
so long as we use it and we move on.
He had to get on the phone. This guy was always on the phone.
So what we going to do now?
It looks like all these Americans are here and
yes, one Brit, and he's not going to do anything --
he thinks he's British actually, and he's actually Nigerian,
I just thought about that.
We eventually got it working, is the truth,
but it was one of these. Even older than the one you saw.
it's just to tell you where and how we were viewing X-rays.
Do you figure where that is? It was on a window.
I mean, what's an X-ray viewing box? Please.
Well, nowadays everything's on PAX anyway.
You look at your X-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them,
you email them. But we were still using X-rays,
but we didn't even have a viewing box!
And we were doing open-heart surgery.
but we still need this stuff. Oh yeah, echo --
this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready.
People still believe in Voodoo. Heart disease,
VSD, hole in the heart, tetralogies.
You still get people who believe in it and they came.
At 67 percent oxygen saturation, the normal is about 97.
Her condition, open-heart surgery that as she required,
would have been treated when she was a child.
We had to do these for adults. So, we did succeed and we still do.
We've done three. We're planning another one in July
in the north of the country. So, we certainly still do open-heart,
but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in --
we ship everything, instruments. We had explosions
because the kit was designed and installed by people who weren't used to it.
The oxygen tanks didn't quite work right.
We did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully.
Here is our very first patient, out of intensive care,
and just watch that chair, all right?
This is what I mean about appropriate technology.
That's what he was doing, propping up the bed because the bed simply didn't work.
Have you seen one of those before?
No? Yes? Doesn't matter, it worked.
I'm sure you've all seen or heard this before:
"We, the willing, have been doing so much with so little for so long --
-- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing."
This one's sole aim is to provide the very things that I think are missing.
So, we put my hand in my pocket and say, "Guys, let's just buy stuff.
Let's go set up a company that teaches people, educates them,
gives them the tools they need to keep going."
Usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital,
you buy a different one for children,
you buy a different one for transport. This one will do everything,
and it will do it at half the price and doesn't need compressed air.
If you're in America and you don't know about this one, we do,
because we make it our duty to find out
what's appropriate technology for Africa -- what's appropriately priced,
does the job, and we move on. Anesthesia machine:
multi-parameter monitor, operating lights, suction.
This little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car,
that charges your, whatever, Game Boy, telephone?
That's exactly how the outlets are designed.
Yes, it will take a solar panel. Yes a solar panel will charge it.
But if you've got mains as well, it will charge the batteries in there.
And guess what? We have a little pedal charger too, just in case.
And guess what, if it all fails,
if you can find a car that's still got a live battery
and you stick it in, it will still work. Then you can customize it.
Is it dental surgery you want? General surgery you want?
Decide which instruments, stock it up with consumables.
The technology for oxygen delivery is not new.
Oxygen concentrators are very old technology. What is new,
and what we will have in a few months, I hope,
is that ability to use this same renewable energy system
to provide and produce oxygen on site. Zeolite -- it's not new --
zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air.
If you take nitrogen out, what's left? Oxygen, pretty much.
So that's not new. What we're doing is applying this technology to it.
This is what makes it so special.
Apart from the awards it's won,
it's portable and it's certified. It's registered, the MHRA --
and the CE mark, for those who don't know, for Europe, is the equivalent
of the FDA in the U.S.
If you compare it with what's on the market, price-wise,
size-wise, ease of use, complexity ...
These are members of my graduating class, 1986.
It was in this gentleman's house in the Potomac,
for those of you who are familiar with Maryland.
There are too many of us outside and everybody,
just to borrow a bit from Hans -- Hans Rosling, he's my guy --
if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention,
it's the problems. But what we really need are African solutions
that are appropriate for Africa -- looking at the culture,
looking at the people, looking at how much money they've got.
African people, because they will do it with a passion, I hope.
And lots and lots of that little bit down there, sacrifice.
You have to do it. Africans have to do it,
in conjunction with everyone else.
Like many of you here, I am trying to contribute
towards a renaissance in Africa.
The question of transformation in Africa
really is a question of leadership.
Africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders.
And it is my contention that the manner in which
we educate our leaders is fundamental
to progress on this continent.
I want to tell you some stories that explain my view.
We all heard about the importance of stories yesterday.
An American friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in Ghana,
and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion
about the state of leadership in Africa
that had taken me over a decade to reach.
Twice she was involved in surgeries
where they lost power at the hospital.
The emergency generators did not start.
There was not a flashlight, not a lantern, not a candle --
pitch black.
The patient's cut open, twice.
The first time it was a C-section.
Thankfully, baby was out -- mother and child survived.
Anesthetic wears off. The patient feels pain.
He's crying. He's screaming. He's praying.
Pitch black. Not a candle, not a flashlight.
And that hospital could have afforded flashlights.
They could have afforded to purchase these things, but they didn't.
And it happened twice.
Another time, she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die
because they refused to give her oxygen that they had.
And so three months later,
just before she returned to the United States,
nurses in Accra go on strike.
And her recommendation is
take this opportunity to fire everyone, start all over again.
Start all over again.
You see, the folks at the ministry of health,
the hospital administrators, the doctors, the nurses --
they are among just five percent of their peers
who get an education after secondary school.
They are the elite. They are our leaders.
Their decisions, their actions matter.
And when they fail, a nation literally suffers.
So when I speak of leadership,
I'm not talking about just political leaders.
We've heard a lot about that.
I'm talking about the elite.
Those who've been trained,
whose job it is to be the guardians of their society.
The lawyers, the judges, the policemen, the doctors,
the engineers, the civil servants --
those are the leaders.
And we need to train them right.
occurred when I was 16 years old.
We had just had a military coup,
and soldiers were pervasive in our society.
They were a pervasive presence.
And one day I go to the airport to meet my father,
and as I walk up this grassy slope from the car park
to the terminal building,
I'm stopped by two soldiers wielding AK-47 assault weapons.
And they asked me to join a crowd of people
that were running up and down this embankment.
Why? Because the path I had taken was considered out of bounds.
No sign to this effect.
what my peers at school might think
if they saw me running up and down this hill.
I was especially concerned of what the girls might think.
And so I started to argue with these men.
It was a little reckless, but you know, I was 16.
I got lucky.
A Ghana Airways pilot falls into the same predicament.
Because of his uniform they speak to him differently,
and they explain to him that they're just following orders.
So he takes their radio, talks to their boss,
and gets us all released.
What lessons would you take from an experience like this?
Several, for me.
Leadership matters. Those men are following
the orders of a superior officer.
I learned something about courage.
It was important not to look at those guns.
And I also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls.
to go to Swarthmore College for my education.
It was a breath of fresh air.
You know, the faculty there didn't want us to memorize information
and repeat back to them as I was used to back in Ghana.
They wanted us to think critically.
They wanted us to be analytical.
They wanted us to be concerned about social issues.
In my economics classes I got high marks
for my understanding of basic economics.
But I learned something more profound than that,
which is that the leaders -- the managers of Ghana's economy --
were making breathtakingly bad decisions
that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse.
And so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters.
It matters a great deal.
I had an inkling,
but I didn't fully realize it until I went out into the workplace
and I went to work at Microsoft Corporation.
And I was part of this team -- this thinking, learning team
whose job it was to design and implement new software
that created value in the world.
And it was brilliant to be part of this team.
It was brilliant.
And I realized just what had happened to me at Swarthmore,
this transformation --
the ability to confront problems, complex problems,
and to design solutions to those problems.
The ability to create is the most empowering thing
that can happen to an individual.
And I was part of that.
grew larger than the GDP of the Republic of Ghana.
And by the way, it's continued to.
The gap has widened since I left.
Now, I've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred.
I mean, it's the people there who are so hardworking,
persistent, creative, empowered.
But there were also some external factors:
free markets, the rule of law, infrastructure.
These things were provided by institutions
run by the people that I call leaders.
And those leaders did not emerge spontaneously.
Somebody trained them to do the work that they do.
Now, while I was at Microsoft, this funny thing happened.
I became a parent.
And for the first time, Africa mattered more to me than ever before.
Because I realized that the state of the African continent
would matter to my children and their children.
That the state of the world -- the state of the world
depends on what's happening to Africa,
as far as my kids would be concerned.
what I call my "pre-mid-life crisis,"
Africa was a mess.
Somalia had disintegrated into anarchy.
Rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war.
And it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction,
and I needed to be back helping.
I couldn't just stay in Seattle and raise my kids
in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it.
This was not the world that I'd want my children to grow up in.
So I decided to get engaged, and the first thing that I did
was to come back to Ghana and talk with a lot of people
and really try to understand what the real issues were.
And three things kept coming up for every problem:
corruption, weak institutions
and the people who run them -- the leaders.
because when you see those three problems,
they seem really hard to deal with.
And they might say, "Look, don't even try."
But, for me, I asked the question,
"Well, where are these leaders coming from?
What is it about Ghana that produces leaders
that are unethical or unable to solve problems?"
So I went to look at what was happening in our educational system.
And it was the same -- learning by rote --
from primary school through graduate school.
Very little emphasis on ethics,
and the typical graduate
from a university in Ghana has a stronger sense
of entitlement than a sense of responsibility.
This is wrong.
Because it seems to me that every society, every society,
must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders.
And Ghana was not paying enough attention.
And this is true across sub-Saharan Africa, actually.
So this is what I'm doing now.
I'm trying to bring the experience that I had at Swarthmore to Africa.
I wish there was a liberal arts college in every African country.
I think it would make a huge difference.
And what Ashesi University is trying to do
is to train a new generation of ethical, entrepreneurial leaders.
We're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity,
who have the ability to confront the complex problems,
ask the right questions, and come up with workable solutions.
but we must believe that these kids are smart.
That if we involve them in their education,
if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront --
that our whole society confronts --
and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world,
that magic will happen.
Now, a month into this project, we'd just started classes.
And a month into it, I come to the office,
and I have this email from one of our students.
And it said, very simply, "I am thinking now."
And he signs off, "Thank you."
It's such a simple statement.
But I was moved almost to tears
because I understood what was happening to this young man.
And it is an awesome thing to be a part
of empowering someone in this way.
I am thinking now.
to craft an honor code themselves.
There's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now
over whether they should have an honor code,
and if so, what it should look like.
One of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart.
Can we create a perfect society?
Her understanding that a student-crafted honor code
constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible.
Now, we cannot achieve perfection,
but if we reach for it, then we can achieve excellence.
I don't know ultimately what they will do.
I don't know whether they will decide to have this honor code.
But the conversation they're having now --
about what their good society should look like,
what their excellent society should look like,
is a really good thing.
Now, I just wanted to leave that slide up
because it's important that we think about it.
I'm very excited about the fact
that every student at Ashesi University does community service before they graduate.
That for many of them, it has been a life-altering experience.
These young future leaders are beginning to understand
the real business of leadership,
the real privilege of leadership,
which is after all to serve humanity.
I am even more thrilled by the fact that least year
our student body elected a woman
to be the head of Student Government.
It's the first time in the history of Ghana
that a woman has been elected head of Student Government
at any university.
It says a lot about her.
It says a lot about the culture that's forming on campus.
It says a lot about her peers who elected her.
She won with 75 percent of the vote.
It turns out that corporate West Africa
also appreciates what's happening with our students.
We've graduated two classes of students to date.
And every single one of them has been placed.
And we're getting great reports back
from corporate Ghana, corporate West Africa,
and the things that they're most impressed about is work ethic.
You know, that passion for what they're doing.
The persistence, their ability to deal with ambiguity,
their ability to tackle problems that they haven't seen before.
This is good because
over the past five years, there have been times
when I've felt this is "Mission: Impossible."
of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right.
I think that the current and future leaders of Africa
have an incredible opportunity
to drive a major renaissance on the continent.
It's an incredible opportunity.
There aren't very many more opportunities like this in the world.
I believe that Africa has reached an inflection point
with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent.
We have reached a moment from which can emerge
a great society within one generation.
It will depend on inspired leadership.
And it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders
will make all the difference.
Thank you, and God bless.
And I must say, I think Emeka is trying to send
a lot of subliminal messages,
because I'm going to keep harping on some of the issues
that have come up.
But I'm going to try and do something different,
and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories,
and try and put a face to a lot of the issues
that we've been talking about.
So, Africa is a complex continent full of contradictions,
as you can see.
We're not the only ones.
I mean, we need a whole conference
just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent.
Just think about that, you know?
And this is typically what we've been talking about,
the role that the media plays in focusing
just on the negative stuff.
Now, why is that a problem?
A typical disaster story:
disease, corruption, poverty.
And some of you might be standing here thinking,
saying, "OK, you know, Ory, you're Harvard-educated,
and all you privileged people come here, saying,
'Forget the poor people.
Let's focus on business and the markets, and whatever.' "
And they're all, "There's the 80 percent of Africans
who really need help."
And it's the story of many of the Africans who are here.
We start with poverty.
I didn't grow up in the slums or anything that dire,
but I know what it is to grow up without having money,
or being able to support family.
Euvin was talking about bellwether signs.
The bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast.
You know, when things were good, we had eggs and sausages.
When things were bad, we had porridge.
And like many African families,
my parents could never save
because they supported siblings, cousins, you know, their parents,
and things were always dicey.
Now, when I was born, they realized they had a pretty smart kid,
and they didn't want me to go to the neighborhood school,
which was free.
approach to education, which was
they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford.
So they took me to a private, Catholic, elementary school,
which set the foundation for what ended up being my career.
And what happened was,
because they could afford it sometimes, sometimes not,
I got kicked out pretty much every term.
You know, someone would come in with a list
of the people who haven't paid school fees,
and when they started getting pretty strict,
you had to leave, until your school fees could be paid.
And I remember thinking, I mean,
why don't these guys just take me to a cheap school?
Because you know, as a kid
you're embarrassed and
you're sensitive, and everyone knows
you guys don't have money.
But they kept at it,
and I now understand why they did what they did.
In Kenya, we have an entrance exam to go into high school.
And there's national schools, which are like the best schools,
and provincial schools.
My dream school at that time was Kenya High School,
a national school.
I missed the cutoff by one point.
And I was so disappointed, and I was like,
"Oh my God, you know, what am I going to do?"
And my father said, "OK, listen.
Let's go and try and talk to the headmistress.
You know, it's just one point. I mean,
maybe she'll let you in if that slot's still there."
So we went to the school,
and because we were nobodies, and because we didn't have privilege,
and because my father didn't have the right last name,
he was treated like dirt.
And I sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him, saying,
you know, who do you think you are?
And, you know, you must be joking if you think
you can get a slot.
And I had gone to school with other girls, who were kids of politicians,
and who had done much, much worse than I did,
and they had slots there.
And there's nothing worse than seeing your parent
being humiliated in front of you, you know?
and I was like, "I'm never, ever going to have
to beg for anything in my life."
They called me two weeks later, they're like,
oh, yeah, you can come now. And I told them to stuff it.
Disease.
My father, who I've been talking about, died of AIDS in 1999.
He never told anyone that he had AIDS,
his fear of the stigma was so strong.
And I'm pretty much the one who figured it out, because I was a nerd.
And I was in the States at the time,
and they called me. He was very sick, the first time he got sick.
And he had Cryptococcal meningitis.
And so I went on to Google, Cryptococcal meningitis, you know.
Because of doctor-patient privilege,
they couldn't really tell us what was going on.
But they were like, you know, this is a long-term thing.
And when I went online and looked at the infectious --
read about the disease,
I pretty much realized what was going on.
But what happened was that he had to be on medication
that, at that time -- Diflucan, which in the States
is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill.
He had to be on that pill for the rest of his life.
You know, so money ran out.
He got sick again.
And up until that time, he had a friend who used to travel to India,
and he used to import, bring him, could
get him a generic version of it.
And that kept him going.
But the money ran out.
He got sick again. He got sick on a Friday.
At that time, there was only one bank that had ATMs in Kenya,
and we could not get cash. The family couldn't get cash
for him to start the treatment until Monday.
The hospital put him on a water drip for three days.
And finally, we figured, well, OK,
we'd better just try and take him to a public hospital.
At least he'll get treated
while we try to figure out the money situation.
And he died when the ambulance was coming
to the hospital to take him.
imagine if this is all you know about me.
How would you look at me?
With pity, you know. Sadness.
And this is how you look at Africa.
This is the damage it causes.
You don't see the other side of me.
You don't see the blogger,
you don't see the Harvard-educated lawyer,
the vibrant person, you know?
And I just wanted to personalize that.
Because we talk about it in big terms,
and you wonder, you know, so what?
But it's damaging.
And I'm not unique, right?
Imagine if all you knew about William
was the fact that he grew up in a poor village.
And you didn't know about the windmill, you know?
And I was just moved.
I was actually crying during his presentation.
He was like, I try and I make.
I was like Nike should hire him, you know, "Just do it!"
When you focus just on the disasters --
(Laughter) (Applause)
-- we're ignoring the potential.
So, what is to be done?
First of all,
Africans, we need to get better at telling our stories.
We heard about that yesterday.
We had some of them this morning.
And this is an example, you know,
blogging is one way of doing that.
Afrigator is an aggregator of African blogs
that was developed in South Africa.
So we need to start getting better.
If no one else will tell our stories, let's do it.
And going back to the point I was trying to make,
this is the Swahili Wikipedia.
Swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in East Africa.
It only has five contributors.
Four of them are white males -- non-native speakers.
The other person is -- Ndesanjo, if you're here, stand up --
is a Tanzanian, [the] first Swahili blogger.
He's the only African who's contributing to this.
the West is doing this.
What are we doing?
Where are the rest of the Swahili speakers?
Why are we not generating our own content?
You know, it's not enough to complain. We need to act.
Reuters now integrates African blogs
into their coverage of Africa.
So, that's a start,
and we've heard of all their other initiatives.
The cheetah generation.
The aid approach, you know, is flawed.
And after all the hoopla of Live 8,
we're still not anywhere in the picture.
No, you're not.
is that it's not enough for us to criticize.
And for those of you in the diaspora
who are struggling with where should I be,
should I move back,
should I stay?
You know, just jump.
The continent needs you.
And I can't emphasize that enough, you know.
I walked away from a job with one of the top firms in D.C.,
Covington and Burling, six figures.
With two paychecks, or three paychecks,
I could solve a lot of my family's problems.
But I walked away from that, because my passion was here,
and because I wanted to do things that were fulfilling.
And because I'm needed here, you know?
I probably can win a prize for the most ways
to use a Harvard Law School degree
because of all the things I'm doing.
and I try and find, you know, opportunities.
But there is such a need, you know?
I'm a corporate lawyer most of the time
for an organization called Enablis
that supports entrepreneurs in South Africa.
We're now moving into East Africa.
And we give them business development services,
as well as financing loan and equity.
I've also set up a project in Kenya,
and what we do is we track the performance
of Kenyan MPs.
My partner, M, who's a tech guru, hacked WordPress.
It costs us, like, 20 dollars a month just for hosting.
Everything else on there is a labor of love.
We've manually entered all the data there.
And you can get profiles of each MP,
questions they've asked in parliament.
We have a comment function,
where people can ask their MPs questions.
There are some MPs who participate,
and come back and ask.
of complaining about our politicians.
You know, I believe that accountability stems from demand.
You're not just going to be accountable
out of the goodness of your heart.
And we as Africans need to start challenging our leaders.
What are they doing?
You know, they're not going to change
just out of nowhere.
So we need new policies, we need --
where's that coming from, you know?
Another thing is that these leaders
are a reflection of our society.
We talk about African governments
like they've been dropped from Mars, you know?
They come from us.
And what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we don't like?
And how can we change that?
So Mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start
inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable.
Where do we go from here?
I believe in the power of ideas.
I believe in the power of sharing knowledge.
and keep the ideas that you've gotten out of here going,
because it can make a difference.
The other thing I want to urge you to do
is take an interest in the individual.
I've had lots of conversations about things I think
need to be happening in Africa.
People are like, "OK, if you don't do aid,
I'm a bleeding heart liberal, what can I do?"
And when I talk about my ideas, they're like,
"BBut it's not scalable, you know.
Give me something I can do with Paypal."
It's not that easy, you know?
And sometimes just taking an interest in the individual,
in the fellows you've met, and the businesspeople you've met,
it can make a huge difference, especially in Africa,
because usually the individual in Africa
carries a lot of people behind them.
Practically. I mean, when I was a first-year student in law school,
my mom's business had collapsed, so I was supporting her.
My sister was struggling to get through undergrad.
I was helping her pay her tuition.
My cousin ran out of school fees, and she's really smart.
I was paying her school fees.
so we said, well, what are we going to do with her?
You know, she's now my baby sister.
And because of the opportunities that were afforded to me,
I am able to lift all those people.
So, don't underestimate that.
An example. This man changed my life.
He's a professor. He's now at Vanderbilt.
He's an undergrad professor, Mitchell Seligson.
And because of him, I got into Harvard Law School,
because he took an interest.
I was taking a class of his, and he was just like,
this is an overeager student,
which we don't normally get in the United States,
because everyone else is cynical and jaded.
He called me to his office and said,
"What do you want to do when you grow up?"
I said, "I want to be a lawyer."
And he was like, "Why? You know,
we don't need another lawyer in the United States."
And he tried to talk me out of it,
but it was like, "OK, I know nothing about applying to law school,
I'm poli-sci Ph.D.
But, you know, let's figure out what I need you to do,
what I need to do to help you out."
And to me at that time university --
I was at University of Pitts for undergrad,
and that was like heaven, OK,
because compared to what could have been in Kenya.
So I'm like, "Yeah, I'm just applying to Pitt for law school."
He was like, "Why? You know, you're smart,
you have all these things going for you."
And I'm like, "Because I'm here and it's cheap,
and you know, I kind of like Pittsburgh."
Like, that's the dumbest reason I've ever heard
for applying to law school.
And, you know, so he took me under his wing, and he encouraged me.
And he said, "Look, you can get into Harvard,
you're that good, OK?
And if they don't admit you, they're the ones who are messed up."
And he built me up, you know?
And this is just an illustration.
We just need a push.
That's all I needed was a push to go to the next level.
Basically, I want to end with my vision for Africa, you know?
A gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity
of us having to leave the continent
so that we can fulfill our potential.
You know, my vision is that my daughter,
and any other African child being born today,
can be whoever they want to be here,
without having to leave.
And they can have the possibility of transcending
the circumstances under which they were born.
That's one thing you Americans take for granted, you know?
That you can grow up, you know, not so good circumstances,
and you can move.
Just because you are born in rural Arkansas, whatever,
that doesn't define who you are.
For most Africans today, where you live, or where you were born,
and the circumstances under which you were born,
determine the rest of your life.
I would like to see that change,
and the change starts with us.
And as Africans, we need to take responsibility for our continent.
Thank you.
As an architect you design for the present,
with an awareness of the past,
for a future which is essentially unknown.
The green agenda is probably the most important agenda
and issue of the day.
And I'd like to share some experience
over the last 40 years -- we celebrate our fortieth anniversary this year --
and to explore and to touch on some observations
about the nature of sustainability.
How far you can anticipate, what follows from it,
what are the threats, what are the possibilities,
the challenges, the opportunities?
I think that -- I've said in the past, many, many years ago,
before anybody even invented the concept of a green agenda,
that it wasn't about fashion -- it was about survival.
that really, green is cool.
I mean, all the projects which have, in some way, been inspired
by that agenda are about a celebratory lifestyle,
in a way celebrating the places and the spaces
which determine the quality of life.
I rarely actually quote anything,
so I'm going to try and find a piece of paper if I can,
[in] which somebody, at the end of last year, ventured the thought
about what for that individual, as a kind of important observer,
analyst, writer -- a guy called Thomas Friedman,
who wrote in the Herald Tribune, about 2006.
He said,
"I think the most important thing to happen in 2006
was that living and thinking green hit Main Street.
We reached a tipping point this year
where living, acting, designing, investing and manufacturing green
came to be understood by a critical mass
of citizens, entrepreneurs and officials
Hence my motto: green is the new red, white and blue."
And I think it was July 20, 1969,
when, for the first time, man could look back at planet Earth.
And, in a way, it was Buckminster Fuller who coined that phrase.
And before the kind of collapse of the communist system,
I was privileged to meet a lot of cosmonauts
in Space City and other places in Russia.
And interestingly, as I think back,
they were the first true environmentalists.
They were filled with a kind of pioneering passion,
fired about the problems of the Aral Sea.
And at that period it was --
but he foresaw all the things that are happening now.
It's another subject. It's another conversation.
You can go back to his writings: it's quite extraordinary.
It was at that time, with an awareness
fired by Bucky's prophecies, his concerns
as a citizen, as a kind of citizen of the planet,
for one of the Canary Islands.
And this probably coincided with the time
And there are some of those qualities in this drawing,
which seeks to sum up the recommendations.
you know, 30-odd years later:
wind energy, recycling, biomass, solar cells.
for the company called Braun.
This is going back the mid-'50s, '60s.
now is coming to the point
where, as the virtual world, which brings so many people together here,
finally connects with the physical world,
there is the reality that that has become humanized,
so that digital world has all the friendliness,
all the immediacy, the orientation of the analog world.
the [unclear], which is a further kind of development --
and again, inspired by the incredible sort of sensual feel.
A very, very beautiful object.
So, something which in [the] '50s, '60s was very exclusive
has now become, interestingly, quite inclusive.
And the reference to the iPod as iconic,
and in a way evocative of performance, delivery --
envy the halo effect that Toyota has gained
from the Prius as the hybrid, energy-conscious vehicle,
which rivals the iPod as an iconic product.
as architects, or anybody involved with the design process --
that the answer to our problems lies with buildings.
Buildings are important, but
they're only a component of a much bigger picture.
you could design a carbon-free house, for example.
That would be the answer.
Unfortunately, it's not the answer.
It's only the beginning of the problem.
You cannot separate the buildings out
from the infrastructure of cites
and the mobility of transit.
For example, if, in that Bucky-inspired phrase, we draw back
and we look at planet Earth,
and we take a kind of typical, industrialized society,
then the energy consumed would be split
between the buildings, 44 percent, transport, 34 percent, and industry.
in other words, the transport of people, which is 26 percent,
then 70 percent of the energy consumption
is influenced by the way that our cites and infrastructure work together.
cannot be separated from the nature of the cities,
of which the buildings are a part.
For example, if you take, and you make a comparison
between a recent kind of city,
The city goes out in annular rings,
consuming more and more green space,
and more and more roads, and more and more energy
in the transport of people between the city center --
which again, the city center, as it becomes deprived
of the living and just becomes commercial, again becomes dead.
If you compared Detroit with a city of a Northern European example --
and Munich is not a bad example of that,
with the greater dependence on walking and cycling --
then a city which is really only twice as dense,
is only using one-tenth of the energy.
In other words, you take these comparable examples
and the energy leap is enormous.
that as the density increases along the bottom there,
the ability to be able to walk a convenient distance,
the quality of civic spaces.
But again, you can see Detroit, in yellow at the top,
extraordinary consumption, down below Copenhagen.
And Copenhagen, although it's a dense city,
is not dense compared with the really dense cities.
In the year 2000, a rather interesting thing happened.
You had for the first time mega-cities, [of] 5 million or more,
And now, out of typically 46 cities,
33 of those mega-cities are in the developing world.
So you have to ask yourself -- the environmental impact of,
for example, China or India.
If you take China, and you just take Beijing,
you can see on that traffic system,
and the pollution associated with the consumption of energy
as the cars expand at the price of the bicycles.
In other words, if you put onto the roads, as is currently happening,
and the half a billion bicycles serving one and a third billion people are reducing.
of the movement from the land to the cities, which took 200 years,
then that same process is happening in 20 years.
In other words, it is accelerating by a factor of 10.
And quite interestingly, over something like a 60-year period,
If I pull back from that global picture,
and I look at the implication over a similar period of time
in terms of the technology -- which, as a tool,
is a tool for designers,
and I cite our own experience as a company,
and I just illustrate that by a small selection of projects --
How does it affect the design of buildings?
And particularly, how can it lead
to the creation of buildings which consume less energy,
in a small market town in the northeast of England,
commuting distance with London.
And here, the first thing you can see
is that this building, the roof is a very warm kind of
In other words, for this community, they have this garden in the sky.
where you can see greenery, you can see sunlight,
And nature is part of the generator, the driver for this building.
And symbolically, the colors of the interior are green and yellow.
It has facilities like swimming pools, it has flextime,
it has a social heart, a space, you have contact with nature.
Now this was 1973.
And they were saying, you know,
"The architects, Norman was always going on about
designing for the future, and you know,
it didn't seem to cost us any more.
So we humored him, we kept him happy."
The image at the top,
what it doesn't -- if you look at it in detail,
really what it is saying is you can wire this building.
This building was wired for change.
So, in 1975, the image there is of typewriters.
And when the photograph was taken, it's word processors.
And what they were saying on this occasion was that our competitors
had to build new buildings for the new technology.
We were fortunate,
because in a way our building was future-proofed.
It anticipated change, even though those changes were not known.
And I was saying, and I wrote, "But we don't have the time,
And that would be to create a kind of three-dimensional bubble --
The library of the Free University, which opened last year,
is an example of that.
And a combination of devices here,
the kind of heavy mass concrete of these book stacks,
and the way in which that is enclosed by this skin,
which enables the building to be ventilated,
to consume dramatically less energy,
by the people who use it.
and to transmit, to transfer that information
now, directly into the factory.
a small factory in Germany, and here you can see the guy with his computer screen,
And then interestingly, that building to then be clad
in the oldest technology, which is the kind of hand-cut shingles.
One quarter of a million of them applied by hand as the final finish.
And again, the way in which that works as a building,
for those of us who can enjoy the spaces,
to live and visit there.
the things that you take for granted?
which opened in 1985, with the ability to be able to reflect sunlight
deep into the heart of this space here.
And in the absence of computers, you have to physically model.
So for example, we would put models under an artificial sky.
and the many kilometers of cable and so on.
And the turning point was probably, in our terms,
when we had the first computer.
And that was at the time that we sought
to redesign, reinvent the airport.
This is Terminal Four at Heathrow, typical of any terminal --
Not going back very far in time, 1990,
that's our office.
And if you looked very closely, you'd see
that people were drawing with pencils,
and they were pushing, you know, big rulers and triangles.
It's not that long ago, 17 years, and here we are now.
That reaches 21 kilometers into the sky.
This is the view you would get, if you looked down on that.
are noting the inexorable rise in temperature,
set in the context of that,
which has a very familiar agenda, I'm sure,
as a public place where we sought to, in a way,
through a process of advocacy,
reinterpret the relationship between society and politicians,
of fuel as we know it.
So it would be totally renewable.
And again, the humanistic sketch, the translation into the public space,
but this very, very much a part of the ecology.
But here, not having to model it for real.
Obviously the wind tunnel had a place,
but the ability now with the computer
to explore, to plan, to see how that would work
a process that, quite interestingly, was developed
in Eastern Germany, at the time of its
dependence on the Soviet Bloc.
which was so clean, it was virtually pollution-free.
I mean, a 94 percent reduction -- virtually clean.
But again, very much about the lifestyle, the quality --
something that would be more enjoyable as a place to work.
And again, we can measure the reduction
in terms of energy consumption.
the project in the city in London.
What are the other ways of putting
the same amount of space on the site?
it's the same amount of space.
make the building fresher.
And you enclose that with something that also
is central to its appearance,
which is a mesh of triangulated structures --
and the way in which triangulation can increase performance
and also give that building its sense of identity.
that the building opens up and breathes into those atria,
So it also has the ability, all the time,
regardless of the direction of the wind,
to be able to make the building fresh and efficient.
And unlike conventional buildings,
the top of the building is celebratory.
It's a viewing place for people, not machinery.
what happens if we seek to use such design strategies
in terms of really large-scale thinking?
The level is dropping, rather like the Aral Sea.
And the Dead Sea is obviously much lower
than the oceans and seas around it.
So there has been a project which rescues the Dead Sea
by creating a pipeline, a pipe,
sometimes above the surface, sometimes buried,
that will redress that, and will feed from the Gulf of Aqaba
into the Dead Sea.
what if that, instead of being just a pipe,
what if it is a lifeline?
What if it is the equivalent, depending on where you are,
of the Grand Canal,
in terms of tourists, habitation, desalination, agriculture?
In other words, water is the lifeblood.
and you look at this area of volatility and hostility,
that a unifying design idea as a humanitarian gesture
could have the affect of bringing all those warring factions together
in a united cause, in terms of something that would be
genuinely green and productive in the widest sense.
Infrastructure at that large scale is also
inseparable from communication.
And whether that communication is the virtual world
or it is the physical world,
then it's absolutely central to society.
Now what form do they take?
How do you make them more friendly at that scale?
because you always have a point of reference.
So what happens when we take that and you expand that further
perhaps the ultimate mega-building.
It is physically the largest project on the planet at the moment.
250 -- excuse me, 50,000 people working 24 hours, seven days.
Larger by 17 percent than every terminal put together
at Heathrow -- built -- plus the new, un-built Terminal Five.
And the challenge here is a building that will be green,
that is compact despite its size
and is about the human experience of travel,
is about friendly, is coming back to that starting point,
is very, very much about the lifestyle.
And perhaps these, in the end, as celebratory spaces.
as we sort of engaged in conversation,
talked about this, talked about cities.
Hubert was saying, absolutely correctly, "These are the new cathedrals."
when I was talking about the Olympic agenda in China
in terms of its green ambitions and aspirations.
And I was voicing the thought that --
it just crossed my mind that New Year's Eve,
a sort of symbolic turning point as we move from 2006 to 2007 --
The way in which somebody like Kennedy inspirationally could say,
And I voiced the thought that maybe at the turn of the year,
I thought that the inspiration was more likely
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa
dates back hundreds of years.
But modernization actually brought communication
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials
started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.
from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms
led me to a new form,
which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.
at that point, and started developing, really,
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,
but to produce to our color specifications.
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market
that could be exported and also service our local market.
forms. The scale became very important,
and it's become our pet project. It's successful,
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.
They all have bank accounts.
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.
It's a weekly turnaround of production.
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.
And that's also modernized today,
and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.
And the rest says it all.
(Applause)
It's very, very difficult
because everyone has spoken. Everything has been said.
So I thought that what may be useful is to remind us
of some of the things that have gone on here,
and then maybe offer some ideas which we can take away,
and take forward and work on.
That's what I'd like to try and do.
We came here saying we want to talk about "Africa: the Next Chapter."
But we are talking about "Africa: the Next Chapter"
because we are looking at the old and the present chapter -- that we're looking at,
and saying it's not such a good thing.
The picture I showed you before, and this picture, of drought, death and disease
is what we usually see.
What we want to look at is "Africa: the Next Chapter,"
and that's this: a healthy, smiling, beautiful African.
And I think it's worth remembering what we've heard
through the conference right from the first day,
where I heard that all the important statistics have been given --
about where we are now,
about how the continent is doing much better.
And the importance of that is that we have a platform to build on.
just to show you, refresh your memories
that we are here for "Africa: the Next Chapter" because for the first time
there really is a platform to build on.
We really do have it going right
that the continent is growing at rates that people had thought would not happen.
After decades of 2 percent, we are now at 5 percent,
and it's going to -- projected -- 6 and 7 percent even.
And inflation has come down.
External debt -- something that I can tell you a long story about
because I personally worked on one of the biggest debts on the continent --
has come down dramatically.
You know, as you can see,
from almost 50 billion down to about 12 or 13 billion.
Now this is a huge achievement.
It's because it shows off our economies, shows off our currencies
and gives a platform on which people can plan and build, including businesses.
We've also seen some evidence that all this is making a difference
because private investment flows have increased.
I want to remind you again --
I know you saw these statistics before --
from almost 6 billion we are now at about 18 billion.
In 2005, remittances -- I just took one country, Nigeria
skyrocketing -- skyrocketing is too dramatic,
but increasing dramatically.
And in many other countries this is happening.
Why is this important? Because it shows confidence.
People are now confident to bring --
if your people in the diaspora bring their money back,
it shows other people that, look,
there is emerging confidence in your country.
And instead of an outflow, you are now getting a net inflow.
It's important that we build this platform,
that we have the president, Kikwete, and others of our leaders who are saying,
"Look, we must do something different."
Because we are confronted with a challenge.
62 percent of our population is below the age of 24.
What does this mean?
This means that we have to focus on how our youth
are going to be engaged in productive endeavor in their lives.
You have to focus on how to create jobs,
make sure they don't fall into disease, and that they get an education.
But most of all that they are productively engaged in life,
and that they are creating the kind of productive environment
in our countries that will make things happen.
And to support this, I just recently --
one of the things I've done since leaving government
is to start an opinion research organization in Nigeria.
Most of our countries don't even have any opinion research.
People don't have voice.
There is no way you can know what people want.
Like in every other country where this has been done,
jobs is the top issue.
I want to leave this up here and come back to it.
But before I get to this slide, I just wanted to run you through this.
And to say that for me, the next stage of building this platform
that now enables us to move forward --
and we mustn't make light of it.
It was only 5, 6, 7 years ago
we couldn't even talk about the next chapter, because we were in the old chapter.
We were going nowhere.
The economies were not growing.
We were having negative per capita growth.
The microeconomic framework and foundation for moving forward
was not even there.
So let's not forget that it's taken a lot to build this,
including all those things that we tried to do in Nigeria that Dele referred to.
Creating our own program to solve problems, like fighting corruption,
building institutions, stabilizing the micro economy.
And it brings us to the debate that has been going on here:
aid versus private sector, aid versus trade, etc.
And someone stood up to say that one of the frustrating things
is that it's been a simplistic debate.
And that's not what the debate should be about.
That's engaging in the wrong debate.
The issue here is how do we get a partnership that involves government donors,
the private sector and ordinary African people
taking charge of their own lives?
How do we combine all this?
To move our continent forward, to do the things that need doing
that I talked about -- getting young people employed.
Getting the creative juices flowing on this continent,
much of what you have seen here.
So I'm afraid we've been engaging a little bit in the wrong debate.
We need to bring it back to say,
what is the combination of all these factors
that is going to yield what we want? (Applause)
For me, the issue about aid --
I don't think that Africans need to now go all the way over to the other side
and feel bad about aid.
Africa has been giving the other countries aid.
Mo Ibrahim said at a debate we were at that
he dreams one day when Africa will be giving aid.
And I said, "Mo, you're right. We have -- no, but we've already been doing it!
The U.K. and the U.S. could not have been built today without Africa's aid."
including human, that built these countries today!
So when they try to give back, we shouldn't be on the defensive.
The issue is not that.
The issue is how are we using what has been given back.
How are we using it?
Is it being directed effectively?
I want to tell you a little story.
Why I don't mind if we get aid, but we use it well.
From 1967 to '70, Nigeria fought a war -- the Nigeria-Biafra war.
And in the middle of that war, I was 14 years old.
We spent much of our time with my mother cooking.
For the army -- my father joined the army as a brigadier -- the Biafran army.
We were on the Biafran side.
And we were down to eating one meal a day, running from place to place,
but wherever we could help we did.
At a certain point in time, in 1969, things were really bad.
We were down to almost nothing in terms of a meal a day.
People, children were dying of kwashiorkor.
I'm sure some of you who are not so young
will remember those pictures.
Well, I was in the middle of it.
We thought she was going to die.
My father was not there.
He was in the army.
So I was the oldest person in the house.
My sister fell very ill with malaria.
She was three years old and I was 15.
And she had such a high fever. We tried everything.
It didn't look like it was going to work.
Until we heard that 10 kilometers away there was a doctor, who was
looking at people and giving them meds.
Now I put my sister on my back -- burning --
and I walked 10 kilometers with her strapped on my back.
It was really hot. I was very hungry.
I was scared because I knew her life depended on my getting to this woman.
We heard there was a woman doctor who was treating people.
I walked 10 kilometers, putting one foot in front of the other.
I got there and I saw huge crowds.
Almost a thousand people were there, trying to break down the door.
She was doing this in a church. How was I going to get in?
with my sister strapped on my back,
find a way to a window.
And while they were trying to break down the door,
I climbed in through the window, and jumped in.
This woman told me it was in the nick of time.
By the time we jumped into that hall, she was barely moving.
She gave a shot of her chloroquine -- what I learned was the chloroquine then --
gave her some -- it must have been a re-hydration --
and some other therapies, and put us in a corner.
In about two to three hours, she started to move.
And then they toweled her down because she started sweating,
which was a good sign.
And then my sister woke up.
And about five or six hours later, she said we could go home.
I strapped her on my back.
I walked the 10 kilometers back and it was the shortest walk I ever had.
I was so happy -- (Applause) -- that my sister was alive!
Today she's 41 years old, a mother of three,
and she's a physician saving other lives.
when it is you or your person involved --
you don't care where -- whether it's aid.
You don't care what it is! (Applause)
You just want the person to be alive!
And now let me become less sentimental, and say that saving lives --
which some of the aid we get does on this continent --
when you save the life of anyone, a farmer, a teacher, a mother,
they are contributing productively into the economy.
And as an economist, we can also look at that side of the story.
These are people who are productive agents in the economy.
So if we save people from HIV/AIDS, if we save them from malaria,
it means they can form the base of production for our economy.
And by the same token --
as someone said yesterday -- if we don't and they die,
their children will become a burden on the economy.
So even from an economic standpoint,
if we leave the social and the humanitarian,
we need to save lives now.
So that's one of the reasons, from a personal experience, that I say
let's channel these resources we get into something productive.
However, I will also tell you that I'm one of those
who doesn't believe that this is the sole answer.
That's why I said the debate has to get more sophisticated.
You know, we have to use it well.
Do you all know that Spain -- part of the EU --
got 10 billion dollars in aid from the rest of the EU?
Resources that were transferred to them --
and were the Spanish ashamed of this? No!
The EU transferred 10 billion. Where did they use it?
Have you been to southern Spain lately? There are roads everywhere.
Infrastructure everywhere.
It is on the back of this that the whole of southern Spain
has developed into a services economy.
Did you know that Ireland got 3 billion dollars in aid?
Ireland is one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union today.
For which many people, even from other parts of the world,
are going there to find jobs.
What did they do with the 3 billion dollars in aid?
They used it to build an information superhighway,
gain infrastructure that
enables them to participate in the
information technology revolution,
and to create jobs in their economy.
They didn't say, "No, you know, we're not going to take this."
Today, the European Union is busy transferring aid.
My frustration is if they can build infrastructure in Spain --
which is roads, highways, other things that they can build --
I say then, why do they refuse to use the same aid
to build the same infrastructure in our countries? (Applause)
one of my worries today is that we have many foundations now.
Now we talk about the World Bank, IMF, and accountability, all that
and the EU.
We also have private citizens now who have a lot of money --
some of them in this audience, with private foundations.
And one day, these foundations have so much money,
they will overtake the official aid that is being given.
But I fear -- and I'm very grateful to all of them
for what they are trying to do on the continent --
but I'm also worried. I wake up with a gnawing in my belly
because I see a new set of aid entrepreneurs on the continent.
And they're also going from country to country,
and many times trying to find what to do.
But I'm not really sure that their assistance
is also being channeled in the right way.
And many of them are not really familiar with the continent.
They are just discovering.
And many times I don't see Africans working with them.
They are just going alone! (Applause)
in hearing from Africans who might know.
They want to visit us,
see what's happening on the ground and make a decision.
And now I'm maybe being harsh.
But I worry because this money is so important.
Now, who are they accountable to?
Are we on their boards when they make decisions
about where to channel money? Are we there?
Will we make the same mistake that we made before?
Have our presidents and our leaders -- everyone is talking about --
have they ever called these people together and said,
"Look, your foundation and your foundation --
you have so much money, we are grateful.
Let's sit down and really tell you where the money should be channeled
and where this aid should go."
Have we done that? The answer is no.
And each one is making their own individual effort.
And then 10 years from now, billions will again have gone into Africa,
and we would still have the same problems.
Our inability to take charge and say to all these people bringing their money,
"Sit down."
And we don't do it because there are so many of us. We don't coordinate.
We've not called the Bill Gates, and the Soros,
and everybody else who is helping and say,
"Sit down. Let's have a conference with you.
As a continent, here are our priorities.
Here is where we want you to channel this money."
Each one should not be an entrepreneur
going out and finding what is best.
We're not trying to stop them at all! But to help them help us better.
And what is disappointing me is that we are not doing this.
Ten years from now we will have the same story,
and we will be repeating the same things.
all this good will that is coming towards our way?
How can we get government to combine properly
with these private foundations, with the international organizations,
and with our private sector.
But it cannot do it alone.
So there might be a few ideas we could think of that could work.
They said this is about proliferating and sharing ideas.
So why don't we think of using some of this aid?
Well, why don't we first say to those helping us out,
"Don't be shy about infrastructure.
That health that you're working on cannot be sustainable without infrastructure.
That education will work better
if we've got electricity and railroads, and so on.
That agriculture will work better if there are railroads to get the goods to market.
Don't be shy of it.
Invest some of your resources in that, too."
And then we can see that this is one combination
of private, international, multilateral money,
private sector and the African that we can put together as a partnership,
so that aid can be a facilitator.
That is all aid can be.
Aid cannot solve our problems, I'm firmly convinced about that.
But it can be catalytic. And if we fail to use it as catalytic,
we would have failed.
one of the reasons is not only just that, you know, these people are stupid
and China is coming to take resources.
It's because there's a little more leverage in terms of the Chinese.
If you tell them, "We need a road here,"
they will help you build it.
They don't shy away from infrastructure.
In fact, the Chinese minister of finance said to me,
when I asked him what are we doing wrong in Nigeria.
He said, "There are two things you need only.
Infrastructure, infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
You are undisciplined." (Applause)
And I repeat it for the continent.
It's the same. We need infrastructure, infrastructure and discipline.
So we can make a catalytic to help us provide some of that.
Now I realize -- I'm not saying -- health and education --
no, you can also provide that as well.
But I'm saying it's not either or.
Let's see how aid can be a facilitator in partnership.
One idea.
Second thing, for the private sector,
people are afraid to take risks on the continent.
Why can't some of this aid be used as a kind of guarantee mechanisms,
to enable people to take risk?
Am I out of time?
OK, so let me not forget my punchline.
One of the things I want everybody to collaborate on is
to support women, to create jobs. (Applause)
A lot has been said here about women, I don't need to repeat it.
But there are people -- women -- creating jobs.
And we know, studies have shown
that when you put resources in the hand of the woman --
in fact, there's an econometric study,
the World Bank Review, done in 2000, showing that
transfers into the hands of women result
in healthier children, more for the household, more for the economy and all that.
So I'm saying that one of the takeaways from here --
I'm not saying the men are not important --
obviously, if you leave the husbands out, what will they do?
They'll come back home and get disgruntled,
and it will result in difficulties we don't want.
We don't want men beating their wives
because they don't have a job, and so on.
because the reason is the men automatically --
they get -- not automatically, but they tend to get more support.
But I want you to realize that resources
in the hands of African women is a powerful tool.
There are people creating jobs.
Beatrice Gakuba has created 200 jobs from her flower business in Rwanda.
We have Ibukun Awosika in Nigeria, with the chair company.
She wants to expand.
She needs another 20 million.
She will create another 100, 200 more jobs.
So take away from here is how are you going to put together
the resources to put money in the hands of women in the middle
who are ready --
business people who want to expand and create more jobs.
And lastly, what are you going to do
to be part of this partnership of aid, government, private sector
and the African as an individual?
Thank you. (Applause)
I got my first computer when I was a teenager growing up in Accra,
and it was a really cool device.
You could play games with it. You could program it in BASIC.
And I was fascinated.
So I went into the library to figure out how did this thing work.
I read about how the CPU is constantly shuffling data back and forth
between the memory, the RAM and the ALU,
the arithmetic and logic unit.
And I thought to myself, this CPU really has to work like crazy
just to keep all this data moving through the system.
When computers were first introduced,
they were said to be a million times faster than neurons.
People were really excited. They thought they would soon outstrip
the capacity of the brain.
This is a quote, actually, from Alan Turing:
"In 30 years, it will be as easy to ask a computer a question
as to ask a person."
This was in 1946. And now, in 2007, it's still not true.
And so, the question is, why aren't we really seeing
this kind of power in computers that we see in the brain?
is that we pay a huge price for the speed
that we claim is a big advantage of these computers.
Let's take a look at some numbers.
This is Blue Gene, the fastest computer in the world.
It's got 120,000 processors; they can basically process
10 quadrillion bits of information per second.
That's 10 to the sixteenth. And they consume one and a half megawatts of power.
So that would be really great, if you could add that
to the production capacity in Tanzania.
It would really boost the economy.
Just to go back to the States,
if you translate the amount of power or electricity
this computer uses to the amount of households in the States,
you get 1,200 households in the U.S.
That's how much power this computer uses.
This is a picture of, actually Rory Sayres' girlfriend's brain.
Rory is a graduate student at Stanford.
He studies the brain using MRI, and he claims that
this is the most beautiful brain that he has ever scanned.
(Laughter)
So that's true love, right there.
Now, how much computation does the brain do?
I estimate 10 to the 16 bits per second,
which is actually about very similar to what Blue Gene does.
So that's the question. The question is, how much --
they are doing a similar amount of processing, similar amount of data --
the question is how much energy or electricity does the brain use?
And it's actually as much as your laptop computer:
it's just 10 watts.
So what we are doing right now with computers
with the energy consumed by 1,200 houses,
the brain is doing with the energy consumed by your laptop.
And let me just summarize. So the bottom line:
the brain processes information using 100,000 times less energy
than we do right now with this computer technology that we have.
How is the brain able to do this?
Let's just take a look about how the brain works,
and then I'll compare that with how computers work.
So, this clip is from the PBS series, "The Secret Life of the Brain."
It shows you these cells that process information.
They are called neurons.
They send little pulses of electricity down their processes to each other,
and where they contact each other, those little pulses
of electricity can jump from one neuron to the other.
That process is called a synapse.
You've got this huge network of cells interacting with each other --
about 100 million of them,
sending about 10 quadrillion of these pulses around every second.
And that's basically what's going on in your brain right now as you're watching this.
In the computer, you have all the data
going through the central processing unit,
and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck,
whereas in the brain, what you have is these neurons,
and the data just really flows through a network of connections
among the neurons. There's no bottleneck here.
It's really a network in the literal sense of the word.
The net is doing the work in the brain.
If you just look at these two pictures,
these kind of words pop into your mind.
This is serial and it's rigid -- it's like cars on a freeway,
everything has to happen in lockstep --
whereas this is parallel and it's fluid.
Information processing is very dynamic and adaptive.
"the problem with computers is that there is not enough Africa in them."
(Laughter)
Brian actually said this in 1995.
And nobody was listening then,
but now people are beginning to listen
because there's a pressing, technological problem that we face.
And I'll just take you through that a little bit in the next few slides.
between the devices that we use to compute in computers,
and the devices that our brains use to compute.
The devices that computers use are what's called a transistor.
This electrode here, called the gate, controls the flow of current
from the source to the drain -- these two electrodes.
And that current, electrical current,
is carried by electrons, just like in your house and so on.
And what you have here is, when you actually turn on the gate,
you get an increase in the amount of current, and you get a steady flow of current.
And when you turn off the gate, there's no current flowing through the device.
Your computer uses this presence of current to represent a one,
and the absence of current to represent a zero.
they no longer behave like this.
In fact, they are starting to behave like the device that neurons use to compute,
which is called an ion channel.
And this is a little protein molecule.
I mean, neurons have thousands of these.
And it sits in the membrane of the cell and it's got a pore in it.
And these are individual potassium ions
that are flowing through that pore.
Now, this pore can open and close.
But, when it's open, because these ions have to line up
and flow through, one at a time, you get a kind of sporadic, not steady --
it's a sporadic flow of current.
And even when you close the pore -- which neurons can do,
they can open and close these pores to generate electrical activity --
even when it's closed, because these ions are so small,
they can actually sneak through, a few can sneak through at a time.
So, what you have is that when the pore is open,
you get some current sometimes.
These are your ones, but you've got a few zeros thrown in.
And when it's closed, you have a zero,
but you have a few ones thrown in.
And the reason why that's happening is that, right now, in 2007 --
the technology that we are using -- a transistor is big enough
that several electrons can flow through the channel simultaneously, side by side.
In fact, there's about 12 electrons can all be flowing this way.
And that means that a transistor corresponds
to about 12 ion channels in parallel.
Now, in a few years time, by 2015, we will shrink transistors so much.
This is what Intel does to keep adding more cores onto the chip.
Or your memory sticks that you have now can carry one gigabyte
of stuff on them -- before, it was 256.
Transistors are getting smaller to allow this to happen,
and technology has really benefitted from that.
that it corresponds to only one electron at a time
can flow through that channel,
and that corresponds to a single ion channel.
And you start having the same kind of traffic jams that you have in the ion channel.
The current will turn on and off at random,
even when it's supposed to be on.
And that means your computer is going to get
its ones and zeros mixed up, and that's going to crash your machine.
don't really know how to compute with these kinds of devices.
And the only kind of thing -- the only thing we know right now
that can compute with these kinds of devices are the brain.
it sends it into the processor or the ALU,
and then it puts the result back into memory.
That's the red path that's highlighted.
The way brains work, I told you all, you have got all these neurons.
And the way they represent information is
they break up that data into little pieces
that are represented by pulses and different neurons.
So you have all these pieces of data
distributed throughout the network.
And then the way that you process that data to get a result
is that you translate this pattern of activity into a new pattern of activity,
just by it flowing through the network.
So you set up these connections
such that the input pattern just flows
and generates the output pattern.
So if this piece of data or this piece of the data gets clobbered,
it doesn't show up over here, these two pieces can activate the missing part
with these redundant connections.
So even when you go to these crappy devices
where sometimes you want a one and you get a zero, and it doesn't show up,
there's redundancy in the network
that can actually recover the missing information.
It makes the brain inherently robust.
What you have here is a system where you store data locally.
And it's brittle, because each of these steps has to be flawless,
otherwise you lose that data, whereas in the brain, you have a system
that stores data in a distributed way, and it's robust.
which is to build a computer that works like the brain.
This is something that we've been working on for the last couple of years.
And I'm going to show you a system that we designed
to model the retina,
which is a piece of brain that lines the inside of your eyeball.
We didn't do this by actually writing code, like you do in a computer.
In fact, the processing that happens
in that little piece of brain is very similar
to the kind of processing that computers
do when they stream video over the Internet.
They want to compress the information --
they just want to send the changes, what's new in the image, and so on --
and that is how your eyeball
is able to squeeze all that information down to your optic nerve,
to send to the rest of the brain.
we went and talked to neurobiologists
who have actually reverse engineered that piece of brain that's called the retina.
And they figured out all the different cells,
and they figured out the network, and we just took that network
and we used it as the blueprint for the design of a silicon chip.
So now the neurons are represented by little nodes or circuits on the chip,
and the connections among the neurons are represented, actually modeled by transistors.
And these transistors are behaving essentially
just like ion channels behave in the brain.
It will give you the same kind of robust architecture that I described.
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here.
And the chip -- I'm going to show you a video
that the silicon retina put out of its output
when it was looking at Kareem Zaghloul,
who's the student who designed this chip.
Let me explain what you're going to see, OK,
because it's putting out different kinds of information,
it's not as straightforward as a camera.
The retina chip extracts four different kinds of information.
It extracts regions with dark contrast,
which will show up on the video as red.
And it extracts regions with white or light contrast,
which will show up on the video as green.
and that's the white background that you see here.
And then it also extracts movement.
When Kareem moves his head to the right,
you will see this blue activity there;
it represents regions where the contrast is increasing in the image,
that's where it's going from dark to light.
And you also see this yellow activity,
which represents regions where contrast is decreasing;
it's going from light to dark.
And these four types of information --
your optic nerve has about a million fibers in it,
and 900,000 of those fibers
send these four types of information.
So we are really duplicating the kind of signals that you have on the optic nerve.
taken from the output of the retina chip are very sparse, right?
It doesn't light up green everywhere in the background,
only on the edges, and then in the hair, and so on.
And this is the same thing you see
when people compress video to send: they want to make it very sparse,
because that file is smaller. And this is what the retina is doing,
and it's doing it just with the circuitry, and how this network of neurons
that are interacting in there, which we've captured on the chip.
So this image here is going to look like these ones,
but here I'll show you that we can reconstruct the image,
so, you know, you can almost recognize Kareem in that top part there.
And so, here you go.
Yes, so that's the idea.
When you stand still, you just see the light and dark contrasts.
But when it's moving back and forth,
the retina picks up these changes.
And that's why, you know, when you're sitting here
and something happens in your background,
you merely move your eyes to it.
There are these cells that detect change
and you move your attention to it.
So those are very important for catching somebody
who's trying to sneak up on you.
when you put Africa in a piano, OK.
This is a steel drum here that has been modified,
and that's what happens when you put Africa in a piano.
And what I would like us to do is put Africa in the computer,
and come up with a new kind of computer
that will generate thought, imagination, be creative and things like that.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Do you put together in your mind the work you're doing,
the future of Africa, this conference --
what connections can we make, if any, between them?
I got my first computer when I was a teenager, growing up in Accra.
And I had this gut reaction that this was the wrong way to do it.
It was very brute force; it was very inelegant.
I don't think that I would've had that reaction,
if I'd grown up reading all this science fiction,
hearing about RD2D2, whatever it was called, and just -- you know,
buying into this hype about computers.
I was coming at it from a different perspective,
where I was bringing that different perspective
to bear on the problem.
And I think a lot of people in Africa have this different perspective,
and I think that's going to impact technology.
And that's going to impact how it's going to evolve.
And I think you're going to be able to see, use that infusion,
to come up with new things,
because you're coming from a different perspective.
I think we can contribute. We can dream like everybody else.
Thank you.
Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
That is the call that chimpanzees make
before they go to sleep in the evening.
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,
from one group of nests to the next.
from where Zeray left off yesterday.
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind
through DNA genetic profiling.
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.
It's kind of commonplace now,
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.
And you can tell an awful lot
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,
from the shape of the muscle attachments,
something about the way they lived
from the various artifacts found with them.
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,
human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us
from that ancient, ancient past.
you very often find people speculating about how early humans
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.
They are more like us than any other living creature,
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.
And we believe that this long period of childhood
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.
As the brain becomes ever more complex
during evolution in different forms of animals,
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role
in an individual's life history.
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.
And we believe that it's in this way
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --
how these are passed from one generation to the next,
through observation, imitation and practice,
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.
And they swagger and they throw rocks.
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,
precursors to love and true altruism.
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.
They are very territorially aggressive.
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.
as we make even more observations.
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,
have helped -- more than anything else --
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.
This is just one photograph from the air,
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,
and realized that outside the park, this forest,
which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken
along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,
that a question came to my mind.
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi
and over the lake from Congo.
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives
of the people living in the villages around the park.
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,
almost desert-like land up in these mountains.
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,
so that within two years they can again be productive.
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.
Most important of all, I believe,
is working with small groups of women,
providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.
And we've got, as is the case around the world,
about 95 percent of all loans returned.
Empowering women, working with education,
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,
as women's education improves, family size drops.
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.
something's happening for conservation.
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --
but when we began the TACARE program,
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,
asking what they were interested in.
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.
They began to understand
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.
This is an area way outside the National Park,
stretching out into all these very degraded lands.
And as these villages have a better standard of life,
they are actually agreeing to put
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,
so that once again, as the trees grow back,
the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors
through which they can travel to interact --
as they must for genetic viability --
with other remnant groups outside the National Park.
So TACARE is a success.
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,
around other wilderness areas
which are faced with extreme population pressure.
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,
are major problems.
There is a great deal of poverty.
And when you get large numbers of people
living in land that is not that fertile,
particularly when you cut down trees,
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,
what's going to happen? Something's got to give.
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --
what are we doing to our planet?
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson
said that if every person on this planet
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,
we need three new planets.
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,
with this extraordinary brain,
capable of the kind of technology
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.
The indigenous people around the world,
before they made a major decision,
used to sit around and ask themselves,
"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,
but the developed world --
major decisions involving millions of dollars,
and millions of people, are often based on,
"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"
And these decisions affect Africa.
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,
talking in the United States, going to Asia.
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.
The earth is poisoning our foods.
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues
that we're going to face in this century --
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,
industrial and household chemicals
that still are being sprayed around the world,
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.
The mangroves are being cut down;
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.
We've talked about the soil erosion.
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels
along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,
leading to climate change.
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.
It's Africa that already is affected.
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,
who are too poor to buy food,
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --
as the last of the trees are cut down.
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.
that as I was traveling around the world
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.
I asked a question. "Why?"
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect
between this extraordinarily clever brain,
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?
And these young people, when I talk to them,
basically they were either depressed or apathetic,
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,
"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future
and there's nothing we can do about it."
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,
I feel this desperation.
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,
which began right here in Tanzania
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,
environmental and social. It's a message of hope.
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.
The most important message of Roots and Shoots:
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things
so that the poor have choice as well.
It depends on how old they are, and which country,
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.
And every group chooses, between them,
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,
recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected
and impinge on each other.
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities
in other parts of the world.
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,
domestic animals as well.
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.
And woven throughout all of this is a message
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,
between religions and between us and the natural world.
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.
We not do have more than this one planet.
that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,
South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,
or just using them to feed their families,
and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others
with their vegetables and their chickens.
It's being used in Uganda
to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.
Once again, they're useful members of society.
We have this program in prisons as well.
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,
with older kids talking to younger ones.
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.
"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,
you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number
from about one million, at the turn of the century,
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.
It's one of my hobbyhorses.
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.
Do we care about the planet for our children?
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?
Do we care about their future?
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.
What we buy. What we wear.
And choose to make these choices with the question,
how will this affect the environment around me?
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,
and we join hands around the world.
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.
All of these technologies we can use.
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.
This change, this change. To see change
that we must have if we care about the future.
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.
And an example is the TACARE program.
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --
if you stop hacking them for firewood,
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:
this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,
the resilience of the human spirit,
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,
and take their part in changing the world.
We could make a very long list,
but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years
of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.
People like this are so inspirational.
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.
And we need some environmental role models as well,
and I've been hearing some of them today.
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message
again, with everyone at TED.
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,
especially the Roots and Shoots program.
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,
I met her today.
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her
and see just one example of how young people,
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,
to make the world a better place,
truly are our hope for tomorrow.
Thank you.
At the break, I was asked by several people
about my comments about the aging debate.
And this will be my only comment on it.
that optimists greatly outlive pessimists.
to the first stages of beginning
to write the code ourselves.
It's only 10 years ago this month
when we published the first sequence
of a free-living organism,
that of haemophilus influenzae.
That took a genome project
from 13 years down to four months.
We can now do that same genome project
in the order of
two to eight hours.
most human pathogens,
a couple of plants,
several insects and several mammals,
including the human genome.
Genomics at this stage of the thinking
from a little over 10 years ago
was, by the end of this year, we might have
between three and five genomes sequenced;
it's on the order of several hundred.
We just got a grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation
to sequence 130 genomes this year,
as a side project from environmental organisms.
So the rate of reading the genetic code has changed.
we've barely scratched the surface
on what is available on this planet.
Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible,
but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass,
whereas all animals only make up about
one one-thousandth of all the biomass.
And maybe it's something that people in Oxford don't do very often,
but if you ever make it to the sea,
and you swallow a mouthful of seawater,
keep in mind that each milliliter
has about a million bacteria
and on the order of 10 million viruses.
have been characterized as of two years ago,
and so we decided to do something about it.
And we started the Sorcerer II Expedition,
where we were, as with great oceanographic expeditions,
trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles.
We started in Bermuda for our test project,
then moved up to Halifax,
working down the U.S. East Coast,
the Caribbean Sea, the Panama Canal,
through to the Galapagos, then across the Pacific,
and we're in the process now of working our way
across the Indian Ocean.
It's very tough duty; we're doing this on a sailing vessel,
in part to help excite young people
about going into science.
The experiments are incredibly simple.
We just take seawater and we filter it,
and we collect different size organisms on different filters,
and then take their DNA back to our lab in Rockville,
where we can sequence a hundred million letters
of the genetic code every 24 hours.
And with doing this,
we've made some amazing discoveries.
that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms
in the environment that had these same pigments.
It turns out, almost every species
in the upper parts of the ocean
in warm parts of the world
have these same photoreceptors,
and use sunlight as the source of their energy
and communication.
From one site, from one barrel of seawater,
we discovered 1.3 million new genes
and as many as 50,000 new species.
now with a grant from the Sloan Foundation.
We're measuring how many viruses and bacteria
all of us are breathing in and out every day,
particularly on airplanes
or closed auditoriums.
(Laughter)
We filter through some simple apparatuses;
we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day
filtering on top of a building in New York City.
And we're in the process of sequencing all that
at the present time.
just where we are through the Galapagos,
we're finding that almost every 200 miles,
we see tremendous diversity
in the samples in the ocean.
Some of these make logical sense,
in terms of different temperature gradients.
So this is a satellite photograph
based on temperatures -- red being warm,
blue being cold --
and we found there's a tremendous difference between
the warm water samples and the cold water samples,
in terms of abundant species.
The other thing that surprised us quite a bit
is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light,
and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence.
And these vary tremendously from region to region.
Maybe not surprisingly,
in the deep ocean, where it's mostly blue,
the photoreceptors tend to see blue light.
When there's a lot of chlorophyll around,
they see a lot of green light.
But they vary even more,
possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet
in the extremes.
of what our gene repertoire was,
we assembled all the data --
including all of ours thus far from the expedition,
which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet --
and it totaled around 29 million genes.
And we tried to put these into gene families
to see what these discoveries are:
Are we just discovering new members of known families,
or are we discovering new families?
And it turns out we have about 50,000
major gene families,
but every new sample we take in the environment
adds in a linear fashion to these new families.
So we're at the earliest stages of discovery
about basic genes,
components and life on this planet.
we're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals.
Of those roughly 29 million genes,
we only have around 24,000
in our genome.
And if you take all animals together,
we probably share less than 30,000
and probably maybe a dozen
or more thousand different gene families.
I view that these genes are now
not only the design components of evolution.
And we think in a gene-centric view --
maybe going back to Richard Dawkins' ideas --
than in a genome-centric view,
which are different constructs of these gene components.
has changed at sort of the same pace
that DNA sequencing has
over the last decade or two,
and is getting very rapid and very cheap.
Our first thought about synthetic genomics came
when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995,
and that from mycoplasma genitalium.
And we have really nice T-shirts that say,
you know, "I heart my genitalium."
This is actually just a microorganism.
But it has roughly 500 genes.
Haemophilus had 1,800 genes.
And we simply asked the question,
if one species needs 800, another 500,
is there a smaller set of genes
that might comprise a minimal operating system?
Transposons are just small pieces of DNA
that randomly insert in the genetic code.
So we made a map of all the genes
that could take transposon insertions
and we called those "non-essential genes."
But it turns out the environment is very critical for this,
and you can only
define an essential or non-essential gene
based on exactly what's in the environment.
We also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach
with the genomes of 13 related organisms,
and we tried to compare all of those, to see what they had in common.
And we got these overlapping circles. And we found only 173 genes
common to all 13 organisms.
The pool expanded a little bit if we ignored
one intracellular parasite;
it expanded even more
when we looked at core sets of genes
of around 310 or so.
So we think that we can expand
or contract genomes, depending on your point of view here,
to maybe 300 to 400 genes
from the minimal of 500.
was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them,
and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion.
We found that synthesizing accurate DNA
in large pieces was extremely difficult.
Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison, my colleagues on this,
developed an exciting new method
that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus
in only a two-week period
that was 100 percent accurate,
in terms of its sequence and its biology.
It was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of DNA,
injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden,
that DNA started driving the production of the virus particles
that turned around and then killed the bacteria.
This was not the first synthetic virus --
a polio virus had been made a year before --
but it was only one ten-thousandth as active
and it took three years to do.
This is a cartoon of the structure of phi X 174.
This is a case where the software now builds its own hardware,
and that's the notions that we have with biology.
and I had recent testimony before a Senate committee,
and a special committee the U.S. government has set up
to review this area.
And I think it's important to keep reality in mind,
versus what happens with people's imaginations.
Basically, any virus that's been sequenced today --
that genome can be made.
And people immediately freak out about things about Ebola or smallpox,
but the DNA from this organism is not infective.
So even if somebody made the smallpox genome,
that DNA itself would not cause infections.
The real concern that security departments have
is designer viruses.
And there's only two countries, the U.S. and the former Soviet Union,
that had major efforts
on trying to create biological warfare agents.
If that research is truly discontinued,
there should be very little activity
on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future.
And possibly eukaryotic cells,
those that we have,
are possible within a decade.
So we're now making several dozen different constructs,
because we can vary the cassettes and the genes
that go into this artificial chromosome.
The key is, how do you put all of the others?
We start with these fragments,
and then we have a homologous recombination system
that reassembles those into a chromosome.
that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed.
It reassembles its genome after this radiation burst
in about 12 to 24 hours,
in outer space due to all our travel there.
This is a glass beaker after
about half a million rads of radiation.
The glass started to burn and crack,
while the microbes sitting in the bottom
just got happier and happier.
Here's an actual picture of what happens:
the top of this shows the genome
after 1.7 million rads of radiation.
The chromosome is literally blown apart.
And here's that same DNA automatically reassembled
24 hours later.
It's truly stunning that these organisms can do that,
and we probably have thousands,
if not tens of thousands, of different species
on this planet that are capable of doing that.
After these genomes are synthesized,
the first step is just transplanting them
into a cell without a genome.
not only for understanding the basis of biology
but for hopefully environmental and society issues.
For example, from the third organism we sequenced,
Methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures;
its energy source is hydrogen
and all its carbon comes from CO2 it captures back from the environment.
So we know lots of different pathways,
thousands of different organisms now
that live off of CO2,
and can capture that back.
So instead of using carbon from oil
for synthetic processes,
we have the chance of using carbon
and capturing it back from the atmosphere,
converting that into biopolymers
or other products.
We have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide,
and we use as a reducing power
to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.
Also, there's numerous pathways
that can be engineered metabolizing methane.
And DuPont has a major program with Statoil in Norway
to capture and convert the methane
from the gas fields there into useful products.
called "Combinatorial Genomics,"
because with these new synthesis capabilities,
these vast gene array repertoires
and the homologous recombination,
we think we can design a robot to make
maybe a million different chromosomes a day.
And therefore, as with all biology,
you get selection through screening,
whether you're screening for hydrogen production,
or chemical production, or just viability.
To understand the role of these genes
is going to be well within reach.
to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight.
Photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen,
and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase
that we think will totally change this process.
We're also combining cellulases,
the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars
and fermentation in the same cell
for producing ethanol.
Pharmaceutical production is already under way
in major laboratories
using microbes.
The chemistry from compounds in the environment
is orders of magnitude more complex
than our best chemists can produce.
I think future engineered species
could be the source of food,
hopefully a source of energy,
environmental remediation
and perhaps
replacing the petrochemical industry.
We delayed the start of our experiments in 1999
until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review
as to whether we should try and make an artificial species.
Every major religion participated in this.
It was actually a very strange study,
because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books,
and they couldn't find anything in them prohibiting making life,
so it must be OK. The only ultimate concerns
were biological warfare aspects of this,
but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments
for the reasons we were doing them.
a multi-institutional study on this,
to work out what the risk and benefits to society are,
and the rules that scientific teams such as my own
should be using in this area,
and we're trying to set good examples as we go forward.
These are complex issues.
I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others
that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world,
this prevailing kind of force of security.
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?
And why have we, as Americans particularly,
become a nation that strives for security above all else?
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.
We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.
People change us. Nothing is secure.
And that's actually the good news.
I think that when that is the focus of your life,
these are the things that happen.
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,
as they might confuse you or challenge you.
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,
new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.
You become part of an "us."
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.
You become your nation. You become your religion.
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you
and protect you from doubt or change.
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.
In reality, it does not really make you safer.
and I was standing on the beaches
and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,
a 30-foot wave could rise up
and desecrate a people, a population and lives.
All this striving for security, in fact,
has made you much more insecure
because now you have to watch out all the time.
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,
worlds that you can no longer inhabit.
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory
and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself.
This becomes your mission. That is all you do.
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes.
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,
occupy them, invade them and kill them,
because they are only obstacles now to your security.
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,
a global movement against [violence against] women,
to travel probably to 60 countries,
and spend a great deal of time in different portions.
I've met women and men all over this planet,
who through various circumstances --
war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --
have never known security,
or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,
who were essentially brutalized and censored.
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.
I was with women in Pakistan
who have had their faces melted off with acid.
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,
or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.
is that there is this emerging species.
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,
we call Vagina Warriors.
These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,
or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,
in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.
They have grieved it, they have died into it,
and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy
towards another mission and another trajectory.
to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.
I venture there are many in this room.
They have a fierceness and a freedom
that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.
Their own personal security is not their end goal,
and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,
because the transformation of suffering is their end goal,
I actually believe they are creating real safety
and a whole new idea of security.
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.
and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo
who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house
for battered women in the Middle East.
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up
and put themselves on the line,
and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,
and were willing to be attacked and criticized.
And through their work over the last years,
this is not only happening that this house is opening,
but it's being supported by many factions of the society
who never would have supported it.
Women in Uganda this year,
who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,
actually evoked the wrath of the government.
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents
to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.
And in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,
two weeks where there was huge discussion.
The government finally made a decision
that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.
But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,
and because they had been willing to risk their security,
it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,
but all of Africa.
As a result, this production, which had already sold out,
every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,
made a decision to keep the money.
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.
She's a high school student.
She had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,
she wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,
that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,
that it was not a good thing.
So she really struggled with this, what to do,
because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school
and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --
I believe it was 100, 150 students
all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,
and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.
but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now
is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,
it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong
for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly
or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.
but I want to give you an update on Agnes.
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.
When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.
That mutilation of her clitoris
had actually obviously impacted her life
and changed it in a way that was devastating.
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,
but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a
torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,
and she would teach people, everywhere she went,
what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,
I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
So, we said, what else could we do?
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.
When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,
she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.
I am proud to tell you that six months ago,
she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.
is that if your end goal is security,
and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening
is that you create not only more insecurity in other people,
but you make yourself far more insecure.
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness
that we are all utterly inter-bended,
and one action by one being in one tiny town
has consequences everywhere.
Real security is not only being able
to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them
and only trusting a situation when they are present.
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,
and I had no idea where I was.
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,
and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter
where I was going, or where I had come from
because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.
All of us are refugees.
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,
moving towards a new place.
Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group,
but that I can visit and find myself in every group.
It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,
but it does mean I am not hardened around them.
I do not use them as weapons.
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,
realizing the place of our connection to one another,
rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.
Thank you very much.
On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said
that in order to survive the twentieth century,
we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process
is that one must allow oneself to feel grief.
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,
and then moving on, I'm fine.
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,
and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,
country to country, and city to city,
the degree to which women, for example, are violated,
and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,
is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,
or I have to take the time now, to process that.
you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.
Why this one?
EE: I think that if you think about women,
women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,
we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,
they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says
that one out of three women on the planet
will be raped or beaten in their lifetime,
we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,
we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,
or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is
if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,
it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.
I'm a contemporary artist and I show in art galleries and museums.
I show a number of photographs and films,
but I also make television programs, books and some advertising,
all with the same concept.
And it's about our fixation with celebrity and celebrity culture,
and the importance of the image:
celebrity is born of photography.
when Princess Diana died.
There was a sort of a standstill in Britain
the moment of her death,
and people decided to mourn her death in a sort of mass way.
I was fascinated by this phenomenon,
so I wondered:
could one erase the image of Diana, actually quite crudely and physically?
So, I got a gun and started to shoot at the image of Diana,
but I couldn't erase this from my memory
and certainly it was not being erased from the public psyche.
Momentum was being built.
The press wrote about her death in rather, I felt, pornographic ways --
like, "Which bit of artery left which bit of body?"
and "How did she die in the back of the car?" --
and I was intrigued by this sort of mass voyeurism,
so I made these rather gory images.
so I got a look-alike of Diana
and posed her in the right positions and angles
and created something that was in, or existed in, the public imagination.
So people were wondering: was she going to marry Dodi?
Was she in love with him?
Was she pregnant? Did she want his baby?
Was she pregnant when she died?
So I created this image of Diana, Dodi and their imaginary mixed-race child
and this image came out, which caused a huge public outcry at the time.
so I started making reference to media imagery --
made it grainy, shot through doorways and so on and so forth --
to titillate the public or the viewer further
in terms of trying to make the viewer more aware of their own voyeurism.
So, this is an image of Diana looking at Camilla kissing her husband,
and this was a sequence of images.
And this gets shown in art galleries like this, as a sequence.
And similarly with the Di-Dodian baby imagery --
this is another art gallery installation.
This is Jane Smith and Jo Bloggs, for instance,
but you think it's Camilla and the Queen,
and I'm fascinated how what you think is real isn't necessarily real.
And the camera can lie,
and it makes it very, very easy
with the mass bombardment of imagery to tell untruths.
So, I continued to work on this project of how photography seduces us
and is more interesting to look at than the actual real subject matter.
And at the same time, it removes us from the real subject matter,
So, the photograph becomes this teaser and incites desire and voyeurism;
what you can't have, you want more.
In the photograph, the real subject doesn't exist
so it makes you want that person more.
And that is the way, I think, that celebrity magazines work now:
the more pictures you see of these celebrities,
the more you feel you know them,
but you don't know them
and you want to know them further.
watch her horses. (Laughter).
And then I was sort of making imagery.
In England there's an expression: "you can't imagine the Queen on the loo."
So I'm trying to penetrate that.
Well, here is the image.
and I was cited as a disgusting artist. The press were writing about this,
giving full pages about how terrible this was.
Which I found very interesting that it was going full cycle:
I was making comments about the press
and about how we know facts and information only by media --
because we don't know the real people;
very few of us know the real people --
but it was going back into the press
and they were publicizing, effectively, my filthy work.
So, these are broadsheets, tabloids, debates were being had all about this work,
films were being banned before people had actually had the look at the work,
politicians were getting involved --
all sorts of things -- great headlines.
I was being asked and paid to do front covers.
Suddenly I was becoming sort of acceptable,
which I found also fascinating.
How one moment -- it was disgusting --
journalists would lie to me to get a story or a photograph of me,
saying my work was wonderful,
and the next minute there were terrible headlines about me.
But then this changed suddenly.
This was, for example, an image that went into Tatler.
This was another newspaper image.
It was an April fool actually, and to this day some people think it's real.
I was sitting next to someone at dinner the other day,
and they were saying there's this great image of the Queen
sitting outside William Hill.
They thought it was real.
and Diana and Marilyn -- and the importance of celebrity in our lives.
How they wheedle their way into the collective psyche
without us even knowing,
and how that should happen.
I explored with actually dressing up as the celebrities myself.
There's me as Diana --
I look like the mass murderer Myra Hindley, I think, in this one. (Laughter).
And me as the Queen.
I then continued on to make a whole body of work about Marilyn --
the biggest icon of all --
and trying to titillate by shooting through doorways and shutters and so on and so forth,
and only showing certain angles to create a reality that, obviously,
is completely constructed.
This is the look-alike, so the crafting elements of this is completely enormous.
She looks nothing like Marilyn,
but by the time we've made her up and put wigs and makeup on,
she looks exactly like Marilyn,
to the extent that her husband couldn't recognize her --
or recognize this look-alike -- in these photographs,
which I find quite interesting.
So, all this work is getting shown in art galleries.
Then I made a book.
I was also making a TV series for the BBC at the time.
Stills from the TV series went into this book.
but how do you get over that?
Because obviously it's making a comment about our culture right now:
that we can't tell what's real.
How do we know when we're looking at something whether it's real or not?
So, from my point of view, it's important to publish it,
but at the same time it does cause a confusion --
intentional on my behalf,
but problematic for any outlet that I'm working with.
So a big disclaimer is put on everything that I do,
and I made narratives about all the European or Brit celebrities
and comments about our public figures.
You know, what does Tony Blair get up to in private with his fashion guru?
And also dealing with the perceptions that are put about
Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein, the links that were put about pre-Iraq war.
And what is going to happen to the monarchy?
Because obviously the British public,
I think, would prefer William to Charles on the throne.
I'm not really interested in the celebrity themselves.
I'm interested in the perception of the celebrity.
And with some look-alikes, they are so good
you don't know whether they're real or not.
and so that was very interesting in terms of the legalities.
It's highly commercial.
But it was a difficulty for me -- because this is my artwork;
should I do advertising? -- at the time.
So I made sure the work was not compromised in any way
and that the integrity of the work remained the same.
But the meanings changed in the sense that with the logo on,
you're closing all the lines of interpretation down to selling a product
and that's all you're doing.
When you take the logo off, you're opening up the interpretations
and making the work inconclusive,
opposed to conclusive when you are advertising.
because I think we made it three years ago.
And it's Camilla in her wedding dress, which, again,
nearly got re-used now, recently prior to her wedding.
Tony Blair and Cherie. And again, the legalities -- we had to be very careful.
It's obviously a very big commercial company, and so this little,
"Shh -- it's not really them,"
was put on the side of the imagery.
And Margaret Thatcher visiting Jeffery Archer in jail.
so I built a sauna bath in one of their windows and created little scenes --
live scenes with look-alikes inside the windows,
and the windows were all steamed up.
So, it's Tony Blair reading and practicing his speech;
I've got them doing yoga inside there with Carole Caplin;
Sven making out with Ulrika Jonsson, who he was having an affair with at that time.
This was a huge success for them
because the imagery got shown in the press the day after
in every single newspaper, broadsheets and tabloids.
It was a bit of a road stopper, which was problematic
because the police kept on trying to clear away the crowds,
but huge fun -- it was great for me to do a performance.
Also, people were taking photographs of this,
so it was being texted around the world extremely quickly, all this imagery.
And the press were interviewing, and I was signing my book. (Laughter).
that I'm working on really for a sort of global market --
my previous book was only for the U.K. market --
that I suppose it could be called humorous.
I suppose I come from a sort of non-humorous background
with serious intent,
and then suddenly my work is funny.
And I think it doesn't really matter that my work is considered humorous, in a way;
I think it's a way in for me to deal with the importance of imagery
and how we read all our information through imagery.
It's an extremely fast way of getting information.
It's extremely difficult if it's constructed correctly,
and there are techniques of constructing iconic imagery.
because it exactly sums up what Elton may be doing in private,
and also what might be happening with Saddam Hussein, and George Bush
reading the Koran upside-down.
For example, George Bush target practice --
shooting at Bin Laden and Michael Moore.
And then you change the photograph he's shooting at,
and it suddenly becomes rather grim and maybe less accessible. (Laughter).
Tony Blair being used as a mounting block,
and Rumsfeld and Bush laughing with some Abu Ghraib photos behind,
and the seriousness, or the intellect, of Bush.
And also, commenting on the behind the scenes --
well, as we know now -- what goes on in prisons.
And in fact, George Bush and Tony Blair
are having great fun during all of this.
based on the perception we have of the celebrities.
What Jack Nicholson might be up to in his celebrity life,
and the fact that he tried to ... he had a bit of road rage
and golf-clubbed a driver the other day.
I mean, it's extremely difficult to find these look-alikes,
so I'm constantly going up to people in the street
and trying to ask people to come
and be in one of my photographs or films.
And sometimes asking the real celebrity,
mistaking them for someone who just looks like the real person,
which is highly embarrassing. (Laughter).
a page a week in their newspaper --
which has been very interesting, working topically.
So, Jamie Oliver and school dinners;
Bush and Blair having difficulty getting alongside Muslim culture;
the whole of the hunting issue,
and the royal family refusing to stop hunting;
and the tsunami issues; and obviously Harry;
Blair's views on Gordon Brown, which I find very interesting;
Condi and Bush.
This image I've decided to show having a reservation about it.
I made it a year ago. And just how meanings change,
and there were a terrible thing that has happened,
but the fear is lurking around in our minds prior to that.
That's why this image was made one year ago,
and what it means today.
So, I'll leave you with these clips to have a look. (Music)
Some of you have heard the story before,
but, in fact, there's somebody in the audience
I used to be a photographer for many years.
In 1978, I was working for "TIME Magazine"
I had never heard the word Amerasian before.
and like a lot of photographers and a lot of journalists,
and I was so unhappy with the article that ran afterwards,
And I was paying for this myself, so I asked the translator
if it would be OK if I stayed for the week.
I had a sleeping bag.
The family had a small shed on the side of the house,
so I said, "Could I sleep in my sleeping bag in the evenings?"
And I just told the little girl, whose name was Eun-Sook Lee,
that if I ever did anything to embarrass her --
was how in love the two of these people were.
And what struck me immediately in meeting Eun-Sook
was how confident she appeared to be,
how happy she seemed to be in her own skin.
And I noticed that she was clowning around.
When the teachers would ask questions,
They would actually cover the windows every night,
and then look at me and say, "Stop."
And I said, "What did I do? Why is everyone crying?"
and she wants to know if you would take Eun-Sook to America with you."
but you know, emotionally I was about 12 years old.
If you know of photographers,
So my friends Gene and Gayle had not heard from me in about a year,
And my friends actually said they were very interested in adopting her.
Did I know anything about this?
Because I hadn't told them what I was doing,
gave us an address on the outside of Seoul.
and her eyes were bloodshot, and she seemed to be in shock.
She didn't recognize me -- there was no recognition whatsoever.
And I had this whole mental picture of -- sort of like Cinderella.
because, you know, I don't speak a word of Korean --
A girl whose mother had been a prostitute,
and she was a prostitute,
and a boy who'd been in and out of jail.
And I said to them, "Look, there's a little girl
but I would like you to come to lunch tomorrow
They were yelling at him, it got to be really ugly.
We went outside, and he was just furious.
And I knew I had totally blown this thing.
"Tell him to calm down, what is he saying?"
And I said, you know, "Look, you're absolutely right.
I don't pretend to understand what's going on here.
I think she's an incredibly special child."
that you probably would like her to have."
And they actually take items of clothing and photographs,
Well, there was an American Maryknoll priest
that I had met in the course of doing the story,
who had 75 children living in his house.
to find out how the adoption process worked.
Because I wanted him to feel
like this was all being done very much above board.
He had kids from all over Korea living there,
and he would find families for these kids.
This is a social worker interviewing Eun-Sook.
they were one of the most respected.
Eun-Sook stayed at Father Keane's,
I said, "Oh God, now what?"
telling them what their life was like with their new families.
Gene and Gayle started studying Korean
the moment they had gotten my first letter.
Gayle couldn't come.
This is the uncle signing the adoption papers.
And Gene was showing Natasha how to use a knife and fork,
and then Natasha was returning the utensil lessons.
The second night, we didn't keep the kids' room,
because we slept on the floor with all the kids at the orphanage.
and we got to the front desk, and the guy said,
We said, "That was so great, we saved this little girl's life."
We were just like, you know, just full of ourselves.
And they always overheat the hotels in Korea terribly,
so during the day I always left the window open.
I'd been doing this every night I'd been there.
I go to close the window and I hear people shouting outside,
and I thought, "Oh, the bars must have just gotten out."
So I open the window and I look out,
And the whole room filled with smoke in about two seconds.
We're all choking, and there's smoke
pouring through the vents, under the doors.
and this what you get when you try playing God, is you hurt people.
And there was a new building, going up,
that was being built right across the street from our hotel.
It was one of just the most horrifying nights.
and drove back to Natasha's village.
This guy's 60 years old.
Like, what could you do for a year?
and told them how famous they were going to be when this book was done.
And four months later, the adoption papers came through.
This is saying goodbye to everybody at the orphanage.
This is Father Keane with Natasha at the bus stop.
It was like the ultimate perk.
and adopted one of the other kids at the orphanage after meeting Natasha.
was three days away from giving birth to her own daughter.
"No, we've got to write the script differently."
This is the first night showing Natasha her new cousins and uncles and aunts.
This is a deal I had with Natasha, which is that when we got to Atlanta
she could cut off my beard.
This is her cooking teacher.
Natasha told me a lot of the kids thought she was stuck up,
and seemed to be very popular very, very quickly.
This is Sydney, who's going to be three years old in a couple of days.
but today was the first time I'm actually seeing him give the whole presentation.
Brain magic. What's brain magic all about?
Brain magic to me indicates that area of magic
linguistic deception, non-verbal communication
and various other techniques to create the illusion of a sixth sense.
I want everybody downstairs also to join in with me and everybody.
OK, reverse your hands.
Now, follow my actions exactly.
Now about half the audience has their left hand up. Why is that?
OK, swap them around, put your right hand up.
Cross your hands over, so your right hand goes over,
interlace your fingers like this,
for me to manipulate the human mind, once you know how.
She could also read the serial numbers on bills
How could somebody read using their fingertips?
I'm going to guide you into the car.
Do you want to take the rest off?
Take it off, you're OK. We'll stop for a second.
Have you ever heard of second sight?
can see through somebody else's eyes.
And I'm going to try that right now.
I'm looking at the road, all the time.
I'm not taking my eyes off the road.
Still got that goddamn blindfold on.
That's so weird.
We're nearly there. Oh, my God!
You're like a freak-ass of nature.
That was the most scary thing I've ever done in my life!
and we got a camera man in the back,
but halfway through the drive,
he told me he had, I think it was a nine-millimeter,
OK, but I want you to realize some facts.
You see, it's very simple, once you know how,
but very complicated in other ways.
Do you mind? Yes, at the end.
OK, give them a round of applause as they come up.
You might want to use the stairs, there.
I haven't set anything up with you.
OK, a little bit closer.
of all the different sensations around you,
because we'll try a voodoo experiment.
be aware of the sensations.
OK, excellent. Open your eyes.
I never touched you.
I'm going to use you again, in a moment.
Now, what I want you to do is look directly at me, OK,
just take a deep breath in through your nose,
Close your eyes right now.
OK, now, I'm not hypnotizing you,
I'm going to take your left hand, and just place it up here.
and I only want you to allow your hand
to sink and drift and float back to the tabletop
at the same rate and speed
as you drift and float into this relaxed state of awareness,
and allow it to go all the way down to the tabletop.
OK, now, allow it to stay there.
Do you understand? Just answer yes or no.
And only when you feel the pressure go back,
Imagine a connection between you and him.
but only when you want it to be released.
You can wait as long as you want,
but only when you want the pressure released.
Point directly at his forehead.
And hold it there, both of you.
Only when you want the pressure to go back, make a downward gesture.
You can wait as long as you want.
when I snap my fingers, your eyes will open, again.
On five, four, three, two, one -- open your eyes, wide awake.
For some magicians or mentalists,
sometimes the spoon will bend or melt, sometimes it will not.
Sometimes the object will slide across the table, sometimes it will not.
Even though it's solid, I'm standing away.
Excellent. Now, I've got a shard of glass here, OK.
I want you to examine the shard of glass.
which will represent him, OK.
But I want you to take this very seriously.
Stare at the glass, ignore everybody right here.
I want you to drop the piece of glass into the bottle.
Think of that guy, that ba -- that guy.
OK, and when you feel the sensation --
it might take a while -- drop it into the glass.
OK, drop it in.
There's five letters in the title.
You didn't react to that, so it's four letters.
There's a K in his name, there is a K.
I knew that because my name starts with a K also,
Actually, Chris, I was going to pick you for this,
but I decided I might want to come back another year.
There you are, OK.
One, two, three and four.
Now, they're all the exact same except this one
But I don't want you to know either, so swivel around on your chair.
They'll keep an eye on me to make sure I don't do anything funny.
No, stay around, OK.
Now, is there any way to see through this blindfold?
No messing around this time. OK, go ahead, mix them up.
My hand is at risk here.
Tell me when I'm over a cup.
But if you were to guess.
Thank you.
of our everyday environments in America
We can't overestimate the amount of despair
And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better
By the way, this doesn't help.
Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."
You can call it suburban sprawl.
I think it's appropriate to call it
the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.
You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.
And it's a tremendous problem for us.
The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us
is that these are places that are not worth caring about.
We're going to talk about that some more.
A sense of place:
your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character
depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,
and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,
syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture
in order to inform us who we are.
it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,
and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.
And when you degrade the public realm,
you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life
and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America
because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas
and market squares of older cultures.
And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about
all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.
This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle
that we threw in the garbage after World War II
and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.
And consequently, we can see the result all around us.
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,
but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.
Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,
by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going
in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.
And if there is one tremendous --
if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,
the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,
it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.
And remember, to create a place of character and quality,
you have to be able to define space.
So how is that being accomplished here?
If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here
and try to look at the Target store over here,
you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)
That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.
Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.
These will be places that are not worth caring about.
that are not worth caring about in the United States today.
When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.
And I want you to think about that when you think about
those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,
spilling their blood in the sand,
and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store
because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.
It is emphatically an outdoor public room.
It has something that is terribly important --
it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --
things go in and out of it. It's permeable.
The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,
and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.
You know, in these places in other cultures,
people just go there voluntarily because they like them.
We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)
You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.
But this is how we do it in the United States.
designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:
Boston City Hall Plaza.
A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)
And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,
and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.
And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.
This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.
It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,
but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.
This is the back of Boston City Hall,
And what is the message that is coming,
what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building
and how is it informing us about who we are?
of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,
and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,
because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.
You know, that it's a despotic building;
it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)
This is it on a smaller scale:
By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,
they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)
and they shouted at me and said,
"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"
Audio jack, power supply --
and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?
You know, we hire firms to design these things.
You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.
You know, eight hours before deadline,
four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table
with all the drawings, and the renderings,
I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)
Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.
It was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause)
So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --
you know -- do some reality testing,
and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)
it's not interesting enough for his clients,
you know, the burglars, the muggers.
It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.
OK.
in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.
It's not that complicated:
buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,
so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,
you know, apartments, offices, and so on.
You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.
They haven't learned that in Monterey.
If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,
you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.
It's really incredible.
and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,
when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.
OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,
where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)
Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.
Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,
we pop a handicapped ramp on that,
and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.
And that's how we do it.
I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America
that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.
Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.
You know, that's not good enough.
We have to do good buildings.
To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,
to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,
to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,
and to soften the hardscape of the buildings
and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.
And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;
they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."
of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.
They're not the same thing.
And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,
which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.
R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch
that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,
city life, and everything connected with it.
And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,
is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,
which is going to be life in the country for everybody.
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:
the country villa along the railroad line,
which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,
but to return to the countryside every night.
And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,
so it really was a form of country living.
and it turns into something rather insidious.
It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia
and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.
Basically, a house with nothing on the side
because this house wants to state, emphatically,
"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.
So you have this one last facade of the house,
the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.
Because -- notice the porch here.
Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.
This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal."
We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.
We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,
getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)
We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,
is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.
Because these places, these habitats,
are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,
and they don't have a lot of experience with medication.
So they take the first one that comes along, often.
These are not good enough for Americans.
These are the schools we are sending them to:
The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.
This is a real school!
You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,
that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.
So every effort is made to keep them within the building.
Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)
We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America
-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.
It is going to change absolutely everything.
Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,
except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.
Forget it. It's not going to happen.
We're going to have to do something else instead.
We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size
virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.
We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.
We're going to have to live closer to each other.
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.
The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.
We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!
We gotta do better than that!
We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,
excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage
by our parents' generation after World War II.
Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.
We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill
in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,
that allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life
and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.
deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.
We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:
the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,
the courtyard, the civic square
and how to really make use of this property.
We can see some of the first ideas
for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.
The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?
Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.
They're not going to be retro-fitted;
they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.
and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.
And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers
in our existing towns and cities.
And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were
because they occupy all the important sites.
And most of them are still going to be there,
although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.
We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.
No amount or combination of alternative fuels
is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.
We're going to have to do everything very differently.
And America's not prepared.
We are sleepwalking into the future.
We're not ready for what's coming at us.
So I urge you all to do what you can.
Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.
Be prepared to be good neighbors.
Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful
to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.
but I think it's particularly important for this audience.
Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?
Consumers are different than citizens.
Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties
to their fellow human beings.
And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,
you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.
And we're going to continue being clueless
going into this very difficult future that we face.
So thank you very much.
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about
and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)
You know, one of the things that I'd like to say upfront is that
I'm really here by accident.
And what I mean -- not at TED -- that I'm --
at this point in my life, truly my set of circumstances
I would truly consider an accident.
But what I'd like to talk to you about today
is perhaps a way in which we could use technology
to make those accidents happen often.
Because I really think, when I look back at how I actually ended up
in this accident, technology played a big role in that.
because I'd like to put in context what I'm going to tell you.
And I think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today
are children and education.
And once I put that in context,
I'd like to tell you a little bit about technology:
why I believe technology is a tremendous enabler;
a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges.
Then, about the initiative that Chris mentioned,
that we decided to launch at AMD that we call 50x15.
And then I'll come back to the beginning,
and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you --
that I believe that in today's world,
it is really important for business leaders
not only to have an idea of what their business is all about,
but to have a passion for something that is meaningful.
I'm one of five children. I'm the oldest, the other four are women.
So I grew up in a family of women.
I learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world.
(Laughter)
And, as you can imagine, if you can picture this:
I was born in a very small village in Mexico,
in, unfortunately, very poor surroundings,
and my parents did not have a college education.
But I was fortunate to be able to have one, and so were my four sisters.
That kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis
that my parents placed on education.
My parents were fanatics about learning,
and I'll come back to that a little bit later.
and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child,
was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a Victrola.
My father found that in a junkyard,
and was able to repair it and make it work. And somehow --
to this day, I frankly don't know how he was so aware
of what was going on in the world -- but,
by inviting me to sit down with him when I was only a few years old,
and playing records in this Victrola by Mozart, and he would tell me
how Mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever,
and how Claire de Lune, which was one of his favorites,
was a real exposure to me to classical music.
He explained to me about Johann Strauss, and how he created the waltzes
that became so famous in the world.
And would tell me a little bit about history too,
when he'd play the 1812 Overture by Tchaikovsky
on this little Victrola, and he would tell me about Russia
and all the things that were happening in Russia at those times
and why this music,
in some way, represented a little bit of that history.
And even as a child, he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity.
And perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech,
but if you can imagine the time when this occurred --
it was in the mid '40s -- this was really, in his view, a pretty piece of high tech.
distill from that experience is that in addition to that,
people ask me and say, "Well,
how did your parents treat you when you were a child?"
And I always said that they were really tough on me.
And not tough in the sense that most people think of,
where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever.
They were tough in the sense that, as I grew up,
both my mother and father would always say to me,
it's really important that you always remember two things.
First of all, when you go to bed at night,
you've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt
the day was a day which you contributed something, and
that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could.
And the second thing they said: and we trust you,
that no matter where you are or where you go,
you will always do the right thing.
Now, I don't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids,
but if you do, please trust me,
it's the most pressure you can put on a child, to say --
(Laughter)
-- we trust you that you will always do the right thing.
When I was out with my friends drinking beer,
I always was very aware of those words --
(Laughter)
is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course,
but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible,
and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.
And in today's world, being useful, affordable and accessible
is not necessarily what happens
in a lot of the technology that is done today.
So, one of our passions in our company,
and now one of my personal passions, is to be able to really work hard
at making the technology useful, accessible and affordable.
And to me, that is very, very critical.
You know, we now have, of course, incredibly powerful computers.
A tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the Internet.
Although frankly speaking, we don't believe the Internet is the killer app.
What we believe is that the Internet, frankly,
is a connection of people and ideas.
The Internet happens to be just the medium
in which those people and ideas get connected.
And the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome.
And so, we believe that through all the changes that have occurred,
that we're faced today with a tremendous opportunity.
If we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although
you've seen a plethora and a myriad of products
that have come to the market today, the key to me is
how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity, in a useful way,
accessibility, in an easy manner,
and also affordability, that
regardless of the economic status that a person could have,
that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology.
enable that a little bit. We would like to create an initiative.
And a couple of years ago at AMD,
we came up with this idea of saying,
what if we create this initiative we call 50x15,
where we are going to aim, that by the year 2015,
half of the world will be connected to the Internet
so that people and ideas can get connected.
We knew we couldn't do it by ourselves, and by no means
did we ever intend to imply that we at AMD could do it alone.
We always felt that this was something that could be done
through partnerships with governments, industry,
educational institutions, a myriad of other companies and, frankly, even competitors.
So, it is really a rather lofty initiative,
if you want to think that way,
but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead,
that was bold enough and courageous enough
that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently.
And I'll come back to that in a minute, because I think
the results so far have been remarkable,
and I can only anticipate and get real excited about
what I think is going to happen in the next eight years,
while we get to the 2015 initiative.
That's year by year. This comes from our friends at Gapminder.com.
Those of you who've never looked at their website,
you should look at it. It's really impressive. And you can see
how the Internet penetration has changed over the years.
And so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say
well, where are we related to our goal towards 2015,
the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces.
One is the Western world,
defined mostly by Western Europe and the United States,
has made an awful lot of progress.
The connectivity in these parts of the world
are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase.
even before the 2015 timeframe. In other parts of emerging countries,
such as India and China, the progress has been good --
has been solid, has been good. But in places that are not as developed,
places like Africa, Latin America and other places in the world,
the progress has been rather slow. As a matter of fact,
I was just recently visiting South Africa.
I had the opportunity to have a discussion with President Mbeki,
and one of the things that we talked about is, what is it
that's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster?
And one of the reasons is, in South Africa,
it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity.
It is impossible, even in the United States, for that cost,
to be able to enable the connectivity that we're all trying to reach.
So, we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner
to be able to bring the cost of this technology down.
So, when you look at this chart,
you look at the very last -- it's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale --
you look at the very end:
we've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent.
But we're excited in our company; we're motivated.
We really think it's a phenomenal driver of things,
to force us to do things differently, and we look forward to being able to actually,
working with so many partners around the world,
to be able to reach that goal.
which I think is really critical, is that it is not a charity.
It is actually a business venture.
Let's take a small segment of this, of this unconnected world,
and call it the education market.
When you look at elementary-school children,
we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world
that could benefit tremendously
from being able to be connected to the Internet.
Therefore, when we see that, we see an opportunity
to have a business that addresses the need of that segment.
And when we embarked in this initiative, from the very beginning
we said it very clearly: this is not a charity.
This is really a business venture,
one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market.
Because what we have learned in the last three years
is that this segment of the market, whether it's education
or under-developed nations, either way, it's a segment that demands
incredibly high quality, incredibly high reliability,
tremendous low cost and access, and a lot of challenges
that frankly, without actually doing it,
it would be very difficult to understand, and
I'll explain that in just a minute.
What we mean by that is,
you know, frankly, the PC was invented in 1980, roughly speaking
more or less, and for 20-odd years, it hasn't changed.
It is still, in most places, a gray or black box, and it looks the same.
And frankly -- and I know that sometimes I offend some of my customers
when I say this, but I truly mean it --
if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it,
it would be very difficult to judge who made it,
because they're all highly commoditized but they're all different.
So, there has not been a human-centric approach
to addressing this segment of the market,
so we really believe it is critical to think of it.
operating room machinery that was designed specifically for Africa.
We're talking about something very similar here.
And it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach.
What I mean by that is that in some parts of the world,
the government plays a key role in the development of technology.
In other parts, it doesn't.
In other parts of the world, you have an infrastructure
that allows for manufacturing to take place.
In other parts, it doesn't. And then we have to be sensitive
about how this technology can be developed
and put into action in those regions.
And the last piece, which is really important --
and this is an opinion that we have, not shared by many,
this is one where we seem to stand alone, on this one --
is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative
can come by fostering local, integrated, end-to-end ecosystems.
the country of South Africa, because I was just there,
therefore I'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have.
It's a country of 45 million people. It's an economy that's emerging.
It's beginning to grow tremendously.
They have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity.
They have a computer company that makes computers in South Africa.
They're developing a software-training environment in their universities.
What a place, what an ideal place
to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software
needed for their schools. And to my surprise, I learned in South Africa
they have 18 dialects, I always thought they only had two --
English and Afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects.
And to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system,
it could only be done from inside.
I don't think this segment of the market can be addressed
by companies parachuting from another place of the world,
and just dumping product and selling into the markets.
So, we believe that in those regions of the world
where the population is large,
and there's an infrastructure that can provide it,
that a local, integrated, end-to-end system
is really critical for its success.
in Mexico, in my home country.
This particular classroom happens to be in the state of Michoacan.
Those of you that might be familiar with Mexico --
Michoacan is a very colorful state.
Children dress with very colorful, colorful clothes,
and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids,
in a computer. And I have to tell you that it's
so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology
and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids.
We just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school
in the West Cape in South Africa,
in a school that's called Nelson Mandela School,
and when you see the faces and activities of these children
being able to access computers, it's just phenomenal.
And recently, they've written us letters,
telling us how excited they are about the impact
that this has had on their lives, on their educational dreams,
on their capabilities, and it's just phenomenal.
in 18 different countries, and we have been able
to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn
what this particular segment of the market needs and demands.
And I have to tell you that although
millions doesn't sound like a lot
in terms of the billions that need to be connected,
it's a start. And we are learning a lot.
And we're learning a tremendous amount about
what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective.
Some of you are familiar with this.
This is a partnership between MIT and a group of companies --
Google is involved, Red Hat -- and AMD is a key player.
The electronics behind the One Laptop per Child
are based on AMD technology; it's a microprocessor.
But to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be,
one of the objectives of the One Laptop per Child
is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life.
Because it was felt that a school day
would last at least eight hours, and
you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop
for at least one full day without having to recharge it.
The engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part,
and battery life on this product is now 15 hours --
just through a lot of innovative work people have done
because they're passionate and motivated to be able to do this.
We expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year,
and we're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer
in the field of education.
It's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market,
not only in the developing countries, but actually
in the developed regions as well, because
there are parts of the United States where this can have
also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient.
in this project, with Architecture for Humanity,
and along with the TED Prize winner Cameron Sinclair,
we're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community
to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region.
And we're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this,
and can't wait to see what comes out of this exciting, exciting activity.
to end this presentation.
I'll tell you that one of the things
that I feel is really critical for us in industry, in business,
is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems.
I don't think it's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet,
and look at numbers and say, yes, that's a good business.
I really believe that you have to have a passion for it.
and I'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father.
And it took me a while to understand it,
but he said to me, when I went to college, he said,
"You're the first person in the family to go to college.
And it's really important you understand
that for civilization to make progress,
each generation has to do better than the last one.
And therefore, this is your opportunity to do better than my generation."
Frankly, I don't know that I really understood what he told me at the time.
I was eager to go off to college, and go find girls, and study,
and girls, and study, but then I finished college and I fell in love.
I graduated. I decided to get married.
And on my wedding day, my father came to me again and said, "You know,
I'm going to remind you again, that each generation
has to do better than the last one.
You have to be a better husband than I was,
because that's how you make progress." And now he began to make sense.
Because I knew what a great husband he was,
and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me,
like he did when I was a little kid. And then a few years later, I had a child,
my first child, and again, my father comes
to the hospital, and we're looking at the glass,
and see all the children on the other side, and he said,
"I've got to remind you again, that for each generation to do better,
you're going to have to be a better father than I was."
That's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge
that he was placing on me, because he was a great father.
But the key is that he instilled in me a passion
to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better,
is not just to be the CEO of a Fortune 500 company.
It's got to be that someday I can look back,
and this place is truly better through some small contribution
that perhaps each of us could make.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Well, first of all, let me thank Emeka -- as a matter of fact,
This conference is going to rank as the most important
in the beginning of the 21st century.
Think African governments will put together a conference like this?
I would also like to pay homage and honor to the TED Fellows
The Cheetah Generation is a new breed of Africans
who brook no nonsense about corruption.
They understand what accountability and democracy is.
They're not going to wait for government to do things for them.
That's the Cheetah Generation,
and Africa's salvation rests on the backs of these Cheetahs.
In contrast, of course, we have the Hippo Generation.
They are stuck in their intellectual patch.
Complaining about colonialism and imperialism,
they wouldn't move one foot.
If you ask them to reform the economies,
they're not going to reform it
because they benefit from the rotten status quo.
Now, there are a lot of Africans who are very angry,
angry at the condition of Africa.
Now, we're talking about a continent that is not poor.
It is rich in mineral resources, natural mineral resources.
But the mineral wealth of Africa is not being utilized
to lift its people out of poverty.
That's what makes a lot of Africans very angry.
And in a way, Africa is more than a tragedy, in more ways than one.
There's another enduring tragedy, and that tragedy is that
there are so many people, so many governments,
so many organizations who want to help the people in Africa.
They don't understand.
Now, we're not saying don't help Africa.
Helping Africa is noble.
But helping Africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd.
It's like the blind leading the clueless.
Africa's begging-bowl leaks.
Did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in Africa
is not invested here in Africa?
It's taken out of Africa.
That's what the World Bank says.
Look at Africa's begging-bowl.
It leaks horribly.
There are people who think that we should pour more money,
more aid into this bowl which leaks.
What are the leakages?
Corruption alone costs Africa 148 billion dollars a year.
Yes, put that aside.
Capital flight out of Africa, 80 billion a year.
Put that aside.
Let's take food imports.
Every year Africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food.
Just add that up, all these leakages.
That's far more than the 50 billion Tony Blair wants to raise for Africa.
Now, back in the 1960s Africa not only fed itself,
it also exported food.
Not anymore.
You know it, I know it, but let's not waste our time
talking about these mistakes because we'll spend all day here.
Let's move on, and flip over to the next chapter,
and that's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter.
The next chapter begins with first of all, asking ourselves
this fundamental question,
"Whom do we want to help in Africa?"
There is the people, and then there is the government or leaders.
Now, the previous speaker before me,
Idris Mohammed, indicated that
we've had abysmal leadership in Africa.
That characterization, in my view, is even more charitable.
an African Internet discussion forum,
and I asked them, I said, "Since 1960, we've had exactly
204 African heads of state, since 1960."
And I asked them to name me just 20 good leaders,
just 20 good leaders --
you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself.
I asked them to name me just 20.
Everybody mentioned Nelson Mandela, of course.
Kwame Nkrumah, Nyerere, Kenyatta -- somebody mentioned Idi Amin.
Even if they had been able to name me 20,
what does that tell you?
20 out of 204 means that the vast majority
of the African leaders failed their people.
And if you look at them, the slate of the post-colonial leaders --
an assortment of military fufu heads,
Swiss-bank socialists, crocodile liberators, vampire elites,
quack revolutionaries.
that Africans have known for centuries.
The second false premise that we make
when we're trying to help Africa
is that sometimes we think that there is something called
a government in Africa that cares about its people,
serves the interests of the people, and represents the people.
There is one particular quote -- a Lesotho chief once said
that "Here in Lesotho, we've got two problems:
rats and the government."
doesn't exist in many African countries.
In fact, what we call our governments are vampire states.
Vampires because they suck
the economic vitality out of their people.
Government is the problem in Africa.
A vampire state is the government --
(Applause)
-- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks
who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves,
their cronies, and tribesmen and exclude everybody else.
The richest people in Africa are heads-of-state and ministers,
and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself.
Where do they get their money?
By creating wealth?
No.
By raking it off the backs of their suffering people.
That's not wealth creation. It's wealth redistribution.
is that if we want to help the African people,
we must know where the African people are.
Take any African economy.
An African economy can be broken up into three sectors.
There is the modern sector, there is the informal sector
and the traditional sector.
The modern sector is the abode of the elites.
It's the seat of government.
In many African countries the modern sector is lost.
It's dysfunctional.
It is a meretricious fandango of imported systems,
which the elites themselves don't understand.
That is the source of many of Africa's problems
where the struggles for political power emanate
and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector,
claiming innocent lives.
is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into.
More than 80 percent of Ivory Coast's development
went into the modern sector.
The other sectors, the informal and the traditional sectors,
are where you find the majority of the African people,
the real people in Africa. That's where you find them.
Now, obviously it makes common sense
that if you want to help the people, you go where the people are.
But that's not what we did.
As a matter of fact,
we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors.
Now, traditional sector is where Africa produces its agriculture,
which is one of the reasons why Africa can't feed itself,
and that's why it must import food.
the informal and the traditional sectors.
And you can't develop the informal and the traditional sectors
without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work.
These two sectors, let me describe to you,
have their own indigenous institutions.
First one is the political system.
Traditionally, Africans hate governments. They hate tyranny.
If you look into their traditional systems,
Africans organize their states in two types.
The first one belongs to those ethnic societies
who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous,
so they didn't want to have anything to do
with any centralized authority.
These societies are the Ibo, the Somali, the Kikuyus,
for example. They have no chiefs.
made sure that they surrounded the chiefs
with councils upon councils upon councils
to prevent them from abusing their power.
In Ashanti tradition, for example,
the chief cannot make any decision
without the concurrence of the council of elders.
Without the council the chief can't pass any law,
and if the chief doesn't govern according to the will of the people
he will be removed.
If not, the people will abandon the chief,
go somewhere else and set up a new settlement.
And even if you look in ancient African empires,
they were all organized around one particular principle --
the confederacy principle,
which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority,
decentralization of power.
This is part of Africa's indigenous political heritage.
Now, compare that to the modern systems
the ruling elites established on Africa.
It is a total far cry.
In the economic system in traditional Africa,
the means of production is privately owned.
It's owned by extended families.
You see, in the West, the basic economic and social unit
is the individual.
The American will say, "I am because I am,
and I can damn well do anything I want, anytime."
The accent is on the "I."
In Africa, the Africans say, "I am, because we are."
The "we" connotes community -- the extended family system.
The extended family system pools its resources together.
They don't take any orders from their chiefs.
They decide what to do.
And when they produce their crops, they sell the surplus
on marketplaces.
When they make a profit it is theirs to keep,
not for the chief to sequester it from them.
So, in a nutshell, what we had in traditional Africa
was a free-market system.
There were markets in Africa
before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent.
Timbuktu was one great big market town.
Kano, Salaga -- they were all there.
Even if you go to West Africa, you notice that market activity
in West Africa has always been dominated by women.
So, it's quite appropriate that this section is called
a marketplace.
The market is not alien to Africa.
but then after independence, all of a sudden,
markets, capitalism became a western institution,
and the leaders said Africans were ready for socialism.
Nonsense.
And even then, what kind of socialism did they practice?
The socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of
Swiss-bank socialism,
which allowed the heads of states and the ministers
to rape and plunder Africa's
treasuries for deposit in Switzerland.
That is not the kind of system Africans had known for centuries.
What do we do now?
Go back to Africa's indigenous institutions,
and this is where we charge the Cheetahs to go into the informal sectors,
the traditional sectors.
That's where you find the African people.
about the informal sector, about the boat-building
that I, myself, tried to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora
to invest in.
Could you please show that?
The men are going fishing in these small boats.
Yes, it's an enterprise.
This is by a local Ghanaian entrepreneur, using his own capital.
He's getting no assistance from the government,
and he's building a second, bigger boat.
A bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed.
It means that he will be able to employ more Ghanaians.
It also means that he will be able to generate wealth.
And then it will have what economists call
external effects on a local economy.
All that you need to do, all that the elites need to do,
is to move this operation into something that is enclosed
so that the operation can be made more efficient.
There is also traditional medicine.
80 percent of Africans still rely on traditional medicine.
The modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed.
Now, this is an area -- I mean, there is a treasure trove of wealth
in the traditional medicine area.
This is where we need to mobilize Africans,
in the Diaspora especially, to invest in this.
We also need to mobilize Africans in the Diaspora,
not only to go into the traditional sectors,
but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within.
We were able to mobilize Ghanaians in the Diaspora
to instigate change in Ghana and bring about democracy in Ghana.
And I know that with the Cheetahs, we can take Africa back
one village at a time.
Thank you very much.
I bet you're worried.
That's why I began this piece.
It needed a context, a culture, a community of other vaginas.
Women go days, weeks, months, without looking at it.
I interviewed a high-powered businesswoman;
You're twisting your head up, arching your back, it's exhausting."
So I decided to talk to women about their vaginas.
They began as casual vagina interviews,
and they turned into vagina monologues.
I talked with over 200 women.
I talked to older women, younger women,
married women, lesbians, single women.
I talked to corporate professionals, college professors, actors, sex workers.
It sounds like an infection, at best.
it never sounds like a word you want to say.
you kill the act right there.
You need to air out your Pussycat."
It began with a conversation with a woman.
and we got onto the subject of her vagina,
and then the next woman said something more amazing,
and the relationship to this whole vagina journey,
because it has been an extraordinary journey
I said, "How could you be happy and live in this world of suffering
and live in this world of pain?"
I mistook happiness for a lot of other things,
like numbness or decadence or selfishness.
One is seeing what's right in front of you,
and talking about it, and stating it.
I think what I learned from talking about the vagina
and speaking about the vagina, is it was the most obvious thing --
it was right in the center of my body and the center of the world --
or try to stop the wave or look back at the wave,
But if I go with the wave,
and I trust the wave and I move with the wave,
and I was talking to one woman and that led to another woman
and that led to another woman.
And then I wrote those stories down,
women would literally line up after the show,
What women lined up to tell me was how they were raped,
and how they were battered, and how they were beaten,
And I wanted to stop doing the "Vagina Monologues,"
because it felt too daunting.
but doesn't intervene on their behalf.
will be beaten or raped in her lifetime.
that's essentially the resource of the planet, which is women.
So in 1997 we got all these incredible women together and we said,
"How can we use the play, this energy, to stop violence against women?"
and all these great actors came -- from Susan Sarandon,
"Let's use the play and have performances once a year,
where we can raise money to stop violence against women
and it is so in every little pocket of every little crater,
because it's become ordinary.
I was dressed in a burqa and I went in with an extraordinary group,
of every single right that was possible to strip women of --
for being caught eating vanilla ice cream.
I was taken to the secret ice cream-eating place in a little town,
where we went to a back room, and women were seated
and a curtain was pulled around us, and they were served vanilla ice cream.
And women lifted their burqas and ate this ice cream.
And I don't think I ever understood pleasure until that moment,
where I have witnessed and met women with their faces melted off.
It has taken me to Juarez, Mexico, where I was a week ago,
where girls are date-raped and drugged.
I have seen terrible, terrible, terrible violence.
But I have also recognized, in the course of seeing that violence,
that being in the face of things and seeing actually what's in front of us
I will say that 80 percent of my consciousness was closed off
to what was really going on in this reality,
is that every single place that I have gone to in the world,
and the vagina kind of fits into all those categories.
and it doesn't get reported in the press or in the media
because I don't think good news ever is news,
and I don't think people who are transforming the planet
are what gets the ratings on TV shows.
But every single country I have been to --
and in the last six years, I've been to about 45 countries,
and many tiny little villages and cities and towns --
I have seen something what I've come to call "vagina warriors."
who has witnessed incredible violence or suffered it,
and rather than getting an AK-47 or a weapon of mass destruction
or a machete,
they hold the violence in their bodies;
they grieve it; they experience it; and then they go out
and devote their lives to making sure it doesn't happen to anybody else.
and I want to tell a few stories,
because I believe that stories are the way that we transmit information,
where it goes into our bodies.
And I think one of the things about being at TED that's been very interesting
is that I live in my body a lot,
and I don't live in my head very much anymore.
And this is a very heady place.
And it's been really interesting to be in my head
for the last two days; I've been very disoriented --
It's a body world, and the species really exists in the body.
And I think there's a real significance in us attaching our bodies to our heads,
that that separation has created a divide
that is often separating purpose from intent.
And the connection between body and head
often brings those things into union.
vagina warriors, who really transformed my understanding
Marsha Lopez was a woman I met in Guatemala.
She was 14 years old, and she was in a marriage
and her husband was beating her on a regular basis.
And she couldn't get out,
because she was addicted to the relationship,
and she had no money.
Her sister was younger than her, and she applied --
we had a "Stop Rape" contest a few years ago in New York --
and she applied, hoping that she would become a finalist
we did this extraordinary V-Day at Madison Square Garden,
where we sold out the entire testosterone-filled dome --
18,000 people standing up to say "Yes" to vaginas,
which was really a pretty incredible transformation.
And she came, and she witnessed this,
and she decided that she would go back and leave her husband,
and that she would bring V-Day to Guatemala.
She was 21 years old.
And I watched her walk up on stage in her red short dress and high heels,
and she stood there and said, "My name is Marsha.
I was beaten by my husband for five years. He almost murdered me.
I left and you can, too."
And Esther Chávez was a brilliant accountant in Mexico City.
She was 72 years old and she was planning to retire.
and in the course of it, she began to discover what was happening
She started to write the stories which documented the disappeared women.
300 women have disappeared in a border town because they're brown and poor.
There has been no response to the disappearance,
She opened a center called Casa Amiga, and in six years,
she has literally brought this to the consciousness of the world.
We were there a week ago,
the people of Juarez, who normally don't even come into the streets,
for that particular community.
I met her three years ago in Kenya.
And Agnes was mutilated as a little girl;
it's an anatomical sculpture of a woman's body, half a woman's body.
where she would teach girls and parents and boys and girls
what a healthy vagina looks like, and what a mutilated vagina looks like.
she walked literally for eight years through the Rift Valley,
through dust, through sleeping on the ground,
and she would find them again --
And in the year that she had the jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.
She said, "Well, Eve, if you gave me some money,
I could open a house and girls could run away,
and they could be saved."
because it's very interrelated to happiness and Agnes.
it was an upper-middle class white community,
and it had all the trappings and the looks
and say it was time to come and pick me up.
there would be someone coming to rescue me.
we go to Kenya, and we're walking,
we arrive at the opening of this house.
because they were preparing this whole ritual.
to stop female genital mutilation in her community,
she had become an outcast, and she was exiled and slandered,
and the whole community turned against her.
And in the Maasai community,
goats and cows are the most valued possession.
They're like the Mercedes-Benz of the Rift Valley.
"I knew then that female genital mutilation would end one day in Africa."
which is the color of the Maasai and the color of V-Day --
It was a gorgeous day in the African sun,
and the dust was flying and the girls were dancing,
but that Mr. Alligator had finally shown up.
And he had shown up, obviously,
we heal the broken part inside each of us.
that this journey -- this miraculous vagina journey --
which is that happiness exists in action;
it exists in telling the truth and saying what your truth is;
And I feel that knowledge and that journey
has been an extraordinary privilege,
and I feel really blessed
Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.
Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --
it all points to evidence that life
for the human species as we know it began right here.
We are on an amazing journey the next four days.
You're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."
and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.
What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?
Go for it! The worst.
Genocide.
But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.
The stories that we want to know,
and the stories that do exist about positive tales.
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities
that exist on this continent,
to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.
So let's get going because Africa,
to some degree, is on a turnaround.
A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,
and how it takes control of its own destiny.
And turnarounds are part and parcel
of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.
And it all started almost a decade ago,
as a young consultant at McKinsey & Company
on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,
But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds
when I was completing my MBA in the United States.
a case on a public-sector leader
that has lessons for the corporate world."
Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power
that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.
became part of the research base for a chapter
in Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."
And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller
and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.
And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed
on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,
"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" --
because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.
The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --
that was used to share news with the rest of the world
of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.
Africa was being used as a success story!
because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack
and headed off for a year of travel
in the middle of my university career.
You should have seen my parents' reaction!
And I sought out the most remote places.
I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.
Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,
and it foretold his destiny of greatness.
This was 300 BC.
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.
was the magical view of the sky at night.
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts
at the Healthcare Development Conference.
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me
because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.
And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.
The first thing that I saw was North America at night --
And while Africa may be dark,
it's aglow with the light in the hearts
of the millions of people that are there.
Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.
It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said
that, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent
that has so much to offer.
Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.
It also is the second most populated continent,
with 900 million people.
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big
that you could fit in the continental United States,
China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.
2,000 is another estimate that's out there --
with over 2,000 languages and dialects.
What does the data say?
As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information
and the changes that are taking place in capital markets.
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,
that's the first sign --
in many countries reaching double-digit figures.
So let's start looking at some of those.
I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.
Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation
to the nine percent.
Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.
More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,
Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.
But that's looking at the big picture.
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.
It's made up --
it's about discussing those very opportunities.
So let's start getting into the countries
and into the specific material and data.
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role
because it is a fascinating position to be in.
To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,
of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.
a bit about the other side of it.
for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.
Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa
were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.
Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.
Because it is actually a long-term play.
that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.
But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa
Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.
Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.
It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.
I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.
Bellwether signs again.
But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital
offshore, off its own balance sheet,
without any sovereign backing --
that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.
Without any sovereign backing,
of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.
It's an important strategic partner.
Let's put Nigeria in perspective.
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --
the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.
But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.
And Emeka and I have had these discussions.
We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."
Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.
For Africa to truly be sustainable,
because I can see that clock counting down.
What else is going on there? Egypt.
textiles, petrochemicals.
It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.
So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse
across the industries -- away from oil.
What's going on there?
In Tanzania last week, we had the launch
of the East African Organic Produce Standard.
It ties in with small-scale farmers
in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.
Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.
Uganda: the New Forest Company,
replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?
But here is the sweetener in the deal.
They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.
Let's go back to Nigeria.
The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,
from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.
But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.
Now let's look at the continent as a whole.
People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,
"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"
It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,
inflation is affected.
Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.
In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.
This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.
If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market
or stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?
In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.
What's going on in some of the other countries?
Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.
But in any investment decision, the key question is,
"What is my alternative investment?"
There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.
What Africa is providing is a diversification play,
10 years ago there, were very few countries
that received sovereign ratings from
the Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.
Today, 16 African countries and growing
have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?
Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --
in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.
The backbone of making investment decisions
for global holders of capital.
Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.
Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.
Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.
So one of the big bellwethers,
and one of my final points I want to mention, is
the interesting thing I read is that CNBC
has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?
It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.
They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.
Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,
So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.
that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.
This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,
and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,
think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.
Because there are amazing opportunities available.
because things can be turned around rather quickly.
a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River
is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river
generating light -- the old heart of darkness
now generating light with hydro-electric power.
That is a transformation in power of ideas.
So the next step, over the next four days,
is us exploring more of these ideas.
that picture will look very different.
Thank you.
It is interesting that in the United States,
the most significant health-care budget
goes to cardiovascular disease care, whether it's private or public.
There's no comparison at all.
A health status of a nation parallels development of that nation.
17 million people die every year from heart disease.
32 million heart attacks and strokes occur.
Most of this is in developing countries, and the majority is in Africa.
85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease
is in developing countries -- not in the West --
and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the West.
It's not just the Africans that should be concerned about that.
All friends of Africa, that will have reason to be in Africa at some point in time,
should be very concerned about this deplorable situation.
Has anyone here wondered what will happen
if you go back to your room at night,
and you start getting chest pains, shortness of breath, sweating?
You're having a heart attack. What are you going to do?
Will you fly back to the U.S., Germany, Europe?
No, you will die. 50 percent will die within 24 hours, if not treated.
In a look at the map of the U.S. -- the graph here,
10 million people here, 10 million here.
By the time you get to 50, it's almost no one left in Nigeria --
life expectancy is 47.
It's not because some people don't survive childhood illnesses --
they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach
about 45 years old and 50 years old.
And those are the times they're most productive.
Those are the times that they should be contributing
to Africa's development. But they're not there.
The best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents.
If you cannot secure the parents,
you cannot guarantee the security of the African child.
It's very well known. I'm not going to spend a lot of time on those.
These are just for information:
hypertension, diabetes, obesity, lack of exercise. The usual suspects.
Right here in Tanzania, 30 percent of individuals have hypertension.
20 percent are getting treated.
Only less than one percent are adequately treated.
If we can treat hypertension alone in Africa,
we'll save 250,000 lives a year. That's quite significant!
In eight short years -- we're here talking about HIV, malaria,
which is all good.
We cannot make the mistakes we've made with malaria and HIV.
In eight short years, non-communicable diseases
will become the leading causes of death in Africa.
This is a typical African hospital. We can't depend on the elites --
they go to USA, Germany, U.K. for treatment. Unbelievable.
You can't depend on foreign aid alone.
Here is the situation: countries are turning inwards.
Post-9/11, [the] United States has had a lot of trouble
to deal with, their own internal issues.
So, they spend their money trying to fix those problems.
You can't rightly -- it's not their responsibility,
it is my responsibility. I have to take care of my own problems.
If they help, that's good! But that is not my expectation.
These worsening indices of health care or health studies in Africa
demand a new look. We cannot keep on doing things
the way we've always done them.
If they have not worked, we have to look for alternative solutions.
This has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us.
Several years ago, we started thinking about it.
Everyone knows the problem. No one knows what the solutions are.
We decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is.
Everyone is ready to throw in money,
in terms of free money aid to developing countries.
Talk about sustainable investment, no one is interested.
You can't raise money.
I have done businesses in healthcare in the United States --
I live in Nashville, Tennessee, health care capital of America.
[It's] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures.
But start telling them, you know,
we're going to try to do it in Nigeria -- everyone runs away.
That is totally wrong. Those of you in the audience here,
if you want to help Africa, invest money in sustainable development.
so you get a glimpse of what we do,
and I'll talk a little bit more about it.
What we have done is to show that high-quality health care,
comparable to the best anywhere in the world,
can be done in a developing country environment.
We have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained,
board certified in the USA, Canada or Britain.
We have every modality that can be done in Vanderbilt,
Cleveland Clinic -- everywhere in the U.S. --
and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost
that you will need to do those things in the United States.
(Applause)
that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay.
We take care of everyone.
(Applause)
Whether you have one dollar, two dollars -- it doesn't matter.
And I will tell you how we're able to do it.
We go for modular units. Units that have multi-modality functions
have modular components. Easy to repair, and because of that,
we do not take things that are not durable and cannot last.
We emphasize training,
and we make sure that this process is regenerative.
Very soon we will all be dead and gone, but the problems will stay,
unless we have people taking over from where we stopped.
We do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals.
We get the generators from the companies.
We manufacture them in-house, ourselves. That keeps the costs down.
So, for a radiopharmaceutical in the U.S. --
that you'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars --
when we're finished manufacturing it in-house,
we come at a price of about two dollars.
(Applause)
between the rich and poor countries
is through education and technology.
All these problems we're talking about --
if we bring development, they will all disappear.
Technology is a great equalizer. How do we make it work?
It's been proved: self-care is cost-effective.
It extends opportunity to the rural centers,
and we can use expertise in a very smart way.
We currently have three locations in the Caribbean,
and we're planning a fourth one.
And we have now decided to go into Africa.
We will be doing the West African Heart Institute
in Port Harcourt, Nigeria. That project will be starting
within the next few months. We hope to open in 2008-09.
And we will do other centers.
This model can be adapted to every disease process.
All the units, all the centers, are linked
through a switched hub to a central server,
and all the images are populated to review stations.
And we designed this telemedicine solution. It's proprietary to us,
and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone
who is interested in doing it. You can still be profitable.
to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world,
just by a click of the button.
I'll lead you through, to see how this happens.
This is at the Heart Institute. The doctors from anywhere can log in.
I can call you in Switzerland and say, "Listen, go into our system.
Look at Mrs. Jones. Look at the study, tell me what you think."
They'll give me that information,
and we'll make the care of the patient better.
The patient doesn't have to travel.
He doesn't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing
because of limited expertise.
I'm happy to say that the things we have implemented --
80 percent of U.S. practices do not have them, and yet the technology is there.
But you know, they have that luxury.
Because if you can't get it in Nashville, you can travel to Birmingham,
two hours away, and you'll get it. If you can't get it in Cleveland,
you can go to Cincinnati. We don't have that luxury,
so we have to make it happen.
When we do it, we will put the cost of care down.
And we'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable.
And everyone will get the care they deserve.
Prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that.
But, you know, you have to tell people what can be done.
It's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive,
and they go home and can't do it.
They need to be alive, they need to feed.
We recommend exercise as the most effective, simple, easy thing to do.
We have had walks every year -- every March, April.
We form people into groups and make them go into challenges.
Which group loses the most weight, we give them prizes.
Which groups record more walking distance by pedometer,
we give them prizes. We do this constantly.
We encourage them to bring children.
That way we start exposing the children from very early on,
on what these issues are. Because once they learn it,
at least 100 skilled jobs in Jamaica alone,
and these are physicians with expertise and special training.
We have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died,
including four free pacemakers in patients
with complete heart block. For those that understand cardiology,
complete heart block means certain death.
If you don't get this pacemaker, you will be dead.
So we are pleased with that.
from people that would have gone to Miami or Atlanta for care.
And we've hopefully saved a lot of lives.
By the end of this year, we would have contributed over one million dollars
in indigent care. In the first four months, it's been 340,000 dollars,
averaging 85,000 dollars a month. The government will not do that,
because they have competing needs.
They need to put resources elsewhere. But we can still do it.
People say, "How can you do that?" This is how we can do that.
At least 4,000 rich Jamaicans that were heading to Miami for treatment
have self-confessed that they did not go to Miami
because of the Heart Institute of the Caribbean.
And, if they went to Miami, they will spend significantly more --
eight to 10 times more. And they feel happy spending it at home,
getting the same quality of care.
And for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay,
it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people
that do not have the resources to pay.
(Applause)
So, we emphasize training. Training is critical.
We have gone further: we have formed a relationship
with the University of Technology, Jamaica,
where I now have an appointment.
And we are starting a biomedical engineering program,
so that we will train people locally, who can repair that equipment.
That way we're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues.
We're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs --
training people in echocardiography, cardiac ultrasound,
those kinds of things. Now, with that kind of training,
it gives people motivation.
Because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging
and all that kind of stuff. In the process, I want you to just hear
from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them.
I'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care
at the University Hospital of the West Indies.
I came to the Heart Institute in 2006,
as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program.
I spent three months at the Heart Institute.
There's been no doubt around my colleagues
about the utility of the training I received here,
and I think there's been an increased interest now in --
particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting.
since the past two years. I received training at this institution.
I think this aspect of training in cardiology
that the Heart Institute of the Caribbean has introduced in Jamaica
is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases.
and you can make it possible for everyone.
Who are we to decide that poor people cannot get the best care?
When have you been appointed to play God?
It is not my decision. My job is to make sure that every person,
no matter what fate has assigned to you, will have the opportunity
to get the best quality health care in life.
Next stop is West African Heart Institute,
that we are going to be doing in Port Harcourt, Nigeria,
as I said before. We will do other centers across West Africa.
We will extend the same system into other areas,
like dialysis treatment.
And anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation,
we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we've done it,
we can change the face of health care in Africa.
Africa has been good to us; it is time for us to give back to Africa.
I am going. Those who want to come,
I welcome you to come along with me.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I don't speak English.
I start speaking English, learning English, about a year ago.
I speak French and I grew up with French, so my English is Franglais.
I'm born in the Western Congo, in an area around here,
and then went to university in Kisangani.
And after I finished, I went to this area, the Ituri Forest.
But what I've been doing --
when I was about 14, I grew in my uncle's house.
And my father was a soldier,
and my uncle was a fisherman and also a poacher.
What I've been doing from 14 to 17 was,
I was assisting them collecting ivory tusk, meat
and whatever they were killing, poaching, hunting in the forest,
bring it in the main city to get access to the market.
Around 17 to 20 years, I became, myself, a poacher.
And I wanted to do it, because -- I believed -- to continue my studies.
I wanted to go to university, but my father was poor, my uncle even.
So, I did it.
And for three to four years, I went to university.
For three times, I applied to biomedical science, to be a doctor.
I didn't succeed.
I was having my inscriptions, my admission to biology.
And I said, "No way, I'm not doing it.
My family's poor, my area don't have better health care.
I want to be a doctor to serve them."
Three times, that means three years, and I start getting old.
I say, "Oh, no, I continue."
So, I did tropical ecology and plant botany.
When I finished, I went to the Ituri Forest for my internship.
It's where I really getting passion with what I'm doing
right up to now -- I'm standing in front of you --
doing botany and wildlife conservation.
with some animals and also plants.
And the training center there was built
around the scientific Congolese staff
and some American scientists also.
So, the Okapi Faunal Reserve protects number --
I think that is the largest number of elephants
we have right now in protected areas in Congo.
It has also chimpanzees.
And it has been named Okapi Faunal Reserve
because of this beautiful creature.
That is a forest giraffe.
I think you guys know it quite well.
Here we have savanna giraffes,
but through evolution we have this forest giraffe
that lives only in Congo.
And it has the Ituri Forest itself --
about 1,300 species of plants, so far known.
but I started working with them as a student in 1991.
I was appointed as a teaching assistant at my university
because I accomplished with honor.
But I didn't like the way -- the instruction I got was very poor.
And I wanted to be formed to a training center and a research center.
With the end of the dictatorship regime of Mobutu Sese Seko,
that most of you know, life became very, very difficult.
And the work we have been doing
was completely difficult to do and to achieve it.
so Mobutu soldiers started moving and retreated.
So they started fleeing from the east to the west.
And the Okapi Faunal Reserve is there,
so there was a road from Goma, somewhere here,
and coming like this.
So they might go through, pass through the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
Congo has five of the world's richest sites of protected area,
and the Okapi Faunal Reserve is one of them.
So soldier was fleeing in the Okapi Faunal Reserve.
On their way, they looted everything.
Torture, wars -- oh, my God, you can't believe.
Every person was looking his way -- where to go, we don't know.
And it was for us, the young, the first time really
we hear the language of war, of guns.
And even people who faced the rebellion of 1963,
after our independence, they didn't believe what was happening.
They were killing people. They were doing whatever they want
because they have power.
Who have been doing that?
Young children. Child soldiers.
You can't ask him how old he is because he has guns.
I even [at] that time was not speaking Swahili.
And when they came, they looted everything.
You can't speak Lingala because Lingala was from Mobutu,
and everyone speaking Lingala is soldier.
And I was from the same area to him.
All my friends said, we are leaving because we are a target.
But I'm not going to the east, because I don't know Swahili.
I stay. If I go, I will be killed.
I can't go back to my area -- it's more than 1,000 kilometers [away].
We have been doing research on botany,
and we have a small herbarium of 4,500 sheets of plants.
We cut, we dry and we packed them,
we mounted them on a folder.
Purpose: so that we start them for agriculture,
for medicine, for whatever, and for science,
for the study of the flora and the change of the forest.
That is people moving around, that's even Pygmies.
And this is a bright guy, hard-working person, and Pygmy.
I've been working with him about 10 years.
And with soldiers, they went to the forest for poaching elephants.
Because he's Pygmy, he knows how to track elephants in the forest.
He has been attacked by a leopard and they abandon him in the forest.
They came to told me, I have to save him.
And what I did, I gave him just antibiotics
that we care for tuberculosis.
And fortunately, I saved his life.
Everywhere there has been constant extraction of mineral,
killing animals, the logging timbers and so on.
And what of important things --
I think all of you here have a cell phone.
That mineral has killed a lot:
five millions of Congolese have gone because of this
Colombo-Tantalite -- they call it Coltan --
that they use it to make cell phones
and it has been in that area, all over in Congo. Extraction,
and good, big business of the war.
I have to save something, even myself, my life and life of the staff.
I buried some of our new vehicle engines, I buried it to save it.
And some of equipment went with them,
on the top of the canopy, to save it.
He's not collecting plants, he's going to save our equipment
on the canopy.
And with the material that's left --
I packed it.
And that is me, going to, hurrying to Uganda,
to try to save that 4,000 material,
with people carrying them on the bikes, bicycles.
And after that, we succeeded.
I housed that 4,000 material at the herbarium of Makerere University.
And after the war, I have been able to bring it back home,
so that we continue our studies.
With friends, we had been sitting and watching match football,
and having some good music with WorldSpace radio,
when it started, I think.
So, it was so bad.
We heard that now from the east again the war started,
and it's going fast.
This time I think Kabila will go in place of, as he did with Mobutu.
And the reserve was a target to the rebels.
Three different movements and two militia acting in the same area
and competing for natural resources.
And there was no way to work.
They destroy everything.
Poaching -- oh, no way.
And that's the powerful men. We have to meet and to talk to them.
What's the regulation of the reserve
and what is the regulation of the parks?
And they can't do what they are doing.
So we went to meet them.
There are regulations
that it's prohibited to do logging, mining and poaching, specifically.
But they said, "You guys,
you think that soldiers who are dying are not important,
and your animals you are protecting are most important.
We don't think so.
We have to do it, because to let our movement advance."
I say, "No way, you are not going to do it here."
We started talking with them and I was negotiating.
Tried to protect our equipment, tried to protect our staff
and the villages of about 1,500 people.
And we continued.
Sometimes we are having meeting
and they are talking with Jean-Pierre Bemba,
with Mbusa Nyamwisi, with Kabila, and I'm there.
Sometimes, they talk to my own language, that is, Lingala.
I hear it and what strategy they are doing, what they are planning.
Sometimes, they are having a helicopter
to supply them with ammunition and so on.
They used me to carry that, and I was doing counting,
what comes from where, and where, and where.
I had only this equipment -- my satellite phone, my computer
and a plastic solar panel -- that I hide it in the forest.
And every time, daily, after we have meeting,
what compromise we have, whatever,
I go, I write a short email, send it.
I don't know how many people I had on my address.
I sent the message: what is going about the progress of the war
and what they are planning to do.
They started suspecting that what we do on the morning,
and the afternoon, it's on the news, BBC, RFI.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Sorry.
I said, "I have never seen it.
(Laughter)
I don't know."
And I had mine on my pocket.
So, it was a chance that they trusted me a lot.
They didn't -- they was not looking on me.
So I was scared.
And when we finished the meeting, I went to return it in the forest.
And I was sending news, doing whatever,
reporting daily to the U.N., to UNESCO, to our institution in New York,
what have been going.
And for that, they have been having big pressure to leave, to free the area.
Because there was no way --
whatever they do, it's known the same time.
We have a zoo of 14 Okapis, and one of them was pregnant.
This is the only trouser and shirt remind me of this.
This is not local population, this is rebels.
They are now happy sending the news
that they have protected the Okapi with the war,
because we sent the news that they are killing
and poaching everywhere.
After a week, we celebrated the birthday of that Okapi,
they killed an elephant, just 50 meters to the area
where the zoo, where Okapi was born.
And I was mad.
And I succeeded.
The elephant just decayed and they just got the tusks.
we have to rebuild.
I had some money. I was paid 150 dollars.
I devoted half of it to rebuild the herbarium,
because we didn't have good infrastructure to start plants.
Wildlife Conservation Society more dealing with plants.
I started this with 70 dollars,
and start fundraising money to where I've been going.
I had opportunity to go all over,
where herbarium for my African material is.
And they supported me a bit, and I built this.
Now, it's doing work to train young Congolese.
my design is tracking the global warming effect on biodiversity,
and what the impacts of the Ituri Forest is playing to uptake carbon.
where we have tagged trees and lianas from one centimeters,
and we are tracking them.
We have now data of about 15 years,
to see how that forest is contributing to the carbon reductions.
And that is -- I think it's difficult for me.
This is a very embarrassing talk, I know.
I don't know where to start, where to finish it.
what best title I wanted to say to my talk, I didn't find this.
But now I think that I would have titled it, "The Language of Guns."
Where are you people?
I think we see the war like a game --
like soccer, football.
Everybody is happy, but see what it's doing,
see what is going in Darfur.
Now we say, oh, my God.
See what the wars in Rwanda.
That's because of the language of guns.
I don't think that someone may blame Google,
because it's doing the right things,
even if people like Al-Qaeda are using Google
to connect between them.
But it's serving millions for the best.
But what is doing with gun industries?
Thank you.
(Applause)
Just wait over there.
It's an amazing story.
I suspect a lot of people here have the same question I have.
How can we help you?
I think that now I feel nervous.
And I think, helping us, people are acting sometimes by ignorance.
I did it myself.
If I know when I was young,
that [by] killing an elephant, I'm destroying biodiversity,
I would not have done it.
Many, many of you have seen the talents of Africans,
but there are few who are going to school.
Many are dying because of all those kind of pandemics,
HIV, malaria, poverty, not going to school.
What you can assist us, it's by building capacities.
How many have got opportunity like me
to go to U.S., do a master's?
And go -- now, I'm in the Netherlands to do a Ph.D.
But many of them are just here, because they don't have money.
And they can't go even to university.
They can't even attain the bachelor's degree.
Building capacities for the young generation
is going to make a better generation
and a better future tomorrow for Africa.
(Applause)
I'd like to speak about technology trends,
which is something that many of you follow --
but we also follow, for related reasons.
Obviously, being a technology magazine, technology trends
are something that we write about and need to know about.
you live in the future. And we have a long lead-time.
We have to plan issues many months in advance;
we have to guess at what public appetites are going to be six months,
nine months down the road. So we're in the forecasting business.
that's based on technology trends.
In this case, ours is about ideas and information, and, if we're lucky,
some entertainment. But the concept's quite the same.
And so we have to understand
not only why tech's important, where it's going,
but also, very importantly, when -- the timing is everything.
during the peak of the boom in the 1990s, about e-commerce,
or Internet traffic, or broadband adoption, or Internet advertising,
they were all right -- they were just wrong in time.
Almost every one of those has come true just a few years later.
But the difference of a few years on stock-market valuations
is obviously extreme. And that's why timing is everything.
This is the classic Gartner Hype Curve, which talks about
kind of the trajectory of a technology's lifespan.
And just for fun, we put a bunch of technologies on it,
to show whether they were kind of rising for the first high peak,
or whether they were about to crash
into the trough of disillusionment,
or rise back in the slope of enlightenment, etc.
And this is one way to do technology forecasting: get a sense
of where technology is and then anticipate the next upturn.
we'll typically do it twice. Once, we want to do it first.
We want to be the first to do it, for the geeks who appreciate that,
we'll catch it right there at the technology-trigger.
You can see in 1997, we put Linux on the cover.
But then it comes back. And sufficiently big technologies
are going to hit the mainstream, and they're going to burst out.
And then it's time to do it again. Last year.
And that's one way that we try to time technology trends.
that I call my "grand unified theory of predicting the future,"
but it's closer to a petite unified theory of predicting the future.
It's based on the presumption, the observation even,
that all important technologies go through four stages in their life --
at least one of the four stages, sometimes all four of the stages.
And at each one of these stages, can be seen as a collision --
a collision with something else --
for example, a critical price-line that changes both the technology
and also changes its effect on the world. It's an inflection point.
And these are the inflection points that tell you
what the next chapter in that technology's life is going to be,
and maybe how you can do something about it.
The first stage in a technology's advance
is that it'll fall below a critical price.
After it falls below a critical price, it will tend,
if it's successful, to rise above a critical mass, a penetration.
Many technologies, at that point, displace another technology,
and that's another important point.
And then finally, a lot of technologies commoditize.
Towards the end of their life, they become nearly free.
it's an opportunity for the technology to change.
And even if you missed, you know, the first boom of Wi-Fi --
you know, Wi-Fi did the critical price, it did the critical mass,
but hasn't done displacement yet, and hasn't done free yet --
there's still more opportunity in that.
by telling the story of the DVD,
which is a technology which has done all of these.
The DVD, as you know, was introduced in the mid-1990s
and it was quite expensive. But you can see that by 1998,
it had fallen below 400 dollars, and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold.
And it started to take off. And you can see that the units
started to trend up, the hidden inflection point -- it was taking off.
20 percent is often a good proxy for critical mass in a household.
And what's interesting here
is that something else took off along with it: home-theater units.
Suddenly you have a DVD in the house;
you've got high-quality digital video;
you have a reason to have a big-screen television;
you have a reason for Dolby 5.1 surround-sound.
And maybe you have reasons for starting to connect them,
and bring the rest of your entertainment in.
What's interesting also is -- note that Netflix was founded in 1999.
Reed Hastings is here. He clearly saw that that was a moment,
that was an inflection point that he could do something with.
You can see around 2001 it finally out-sold the VCR.
And here too, you can see the implications in the world at large.
Netflix was right -- the Netflix model could capitalize on the DVD
in a way that the video-rental stores couldn't.
Among the DVD's many assets is that it's very small;
you can stick it in the mailer and post it cheaply.
That gave an advantage; that was an implication
of the technology's rise that wasn't obvious to everybody.
There's a company called Apex, a no-name Chinese firm,
who has, several times in the past year, been the number-one
DVD seller in America. Their average price, for last year, was 48 dollars.
You're aware of the
perhaps apocryphal Wal-Mart stampede
over the 30-dollar DVD.
But they're getting very, very cheap,
and look at the interesting implication of it. As they get cheaper,
the premium brands, the Sonys and such, are losing market share,
and the no-names, the Apexes, are gaining them.
They're being commodified, and that's what happens
when things go to zero. It's a tough market out there.
(Laughter)
these four stages of technology's life.
I'd like to talk about some other technologies out there,
just technologies on our radar -- and I'll use this lens,
these four, as a way to kind of tell you
where each one of those technologies is in its development.
They're not necessarily the top-10 technologies out there --
they're just examples of technologies
that are in each one of these periods.
But I think that the implications of them approaching
these crossovers, these intersections, are interesting to think about.
As you probably know, gene sequencing -- in a large part,
because it's built on computers -- is falling in price
at a kind of a Moore's Law-like level.
It is now possible -- will be possible,
and if Craig Venter indeed comes today,
he may tell you something about this --
to sequence the human genome for 40 million dollars by the end of this year.
That's as opposed to billions just a few years ago.
You know, our ability to capture the tools of creation
is getting closer and closer.
that we're discovering is rising very quickly.
Each one of these genes has potential diagnostic test.
There will come a day
when you can have hundreds of thousands of tests done, very cheaply,
if you want to know. You can learn about your own mosaic.
This is a fascinating research from WHO that shows the effect
of generic drugs on anti-retroviral drug compounds and cocktails.
In January 2000, the price was 10,000 dollars, or 27 dollars a day.
The generics came in, first in Brazil and elsewhere,
and the effect was just dramatic on pricing.
Today it's less than 50 cents a day.
And what's interesting is if you look at the price elasticity,
if you look at the correlation between these two,
as the anti-retrovirals come down, the number of people you can treat
goes radically up. And the Clinton Foundation and WHO
believe that they can treat three million people worldwide by 2005 --
two million in sub-Saharan Africa.
And the falling price of drugs has a lot to do with that.
Now we've switched to critical mass.
These are now technologies that are hitting critical mass.
If you look here, here's Linux in red, and it's hit 20 percent.
Interestingly, it's done a crossover before,
but not the crossovers that matter.
The crossover that's going to matter is the one with the blue.
But you can look and see the direction those lines are going,
you can see that at the 20 percent, it's now taken seriously.
It's not just for the geeks any more.
That is, I imagine, what people in Redmond
wake up in the middle of the night thinking about.
(Laughter)
I don't know whether anybody has a Prius 2004, but they're fantastic.
And if you look at the trends here, by about 2008 --
and I don't think this is a crazy forecast --
they'll be two percent of auto sales.
Two percent isn't 20 percent, but in the car business,
which is slow moving, that's huge; that's arrival.
At two percent, you start seeing them on the roads everywhere.
is you've now introduced electric motors to the automobile industry.
It's the first radical change in automobile technology in 100 years.
And once you have electric motors, you can do anything:
you can change the structure of the car in any way you want.
You can have regenerative braking; you can have drive-by-wire;
you can have replaceable body shapes --
it's a little thing that starts with a hybrid,
but it can lead to a whole new era of the car.
Again, it's kind of coming out of nowhere;
it's a little hard to use right now.
There's a company created by the Kazaa founders called Skype.
Look at these numbers. They launched it in August of last year;
they already have nearly four million registered users --
that's critical mass.
And the same thing's happening on the carrier side.
You're looking at IP taking over from some of the traditional
telecom standards. This is a tipping point --
if Malcolm's here, forgive me -- and it's going to change the economics,
and the speed, and the players in the industry.
It's going to look a little bit like that.
Free is something that comes with digital, because
the reproduction costs are essentially free. It comes with IP,
because it's such an efficient protocol. It comes with fiber optics,
because there's so much bandwidth.
Free is really, you know, the gift of Silicon Valley to the world.
It's an economic force; it's a technical force.
It's a deflationary force, if not handled right.
It is abundance, as opposed to scarcity.
Free is probably the most interesting thing.
that can be stored on a hard drive.
You know, there could be a film's [unclear] there,
but it's basically, every song ever made could be stored
on 400 dollars worth of storage by 2008. It takes that entire element,
the physical element, of songs off the table.
And you've seen the numbers.
I mean, you know, the music industry is imploding
in front of our very eyes, and Hollywood's worried as well.
They're facing a force that they haven't faced before.
And their response is draconian, and not necessarily
the one that's going to get them out of this.
perhaps the most powerful of all. I mentioned fiber optics --
their abundance tends to make things free.
This is the price of a phone call to India per minute.
And what's interesting is that it was just 1990
when it was more than two dollars a minute.
India had, still has, a regulated phone system and so did we.
It was surprisingly non-innovative, moved very slowly,
but then there was just so much fiber out there,
you couldn't hold back, and look how quickly the price fell.
It's seven cents a minute, in many cases.
to India, is the pissed-off programmer, is the outsourcing.
It is probably one of the most dramatic shifts in globalization
and one of the most powerful economic tools
that we're seeing in our world today.
The force of India, and then China, and any other country
that can contact our markets
and will work with our companies -- because the communications are free --
is just beginning to be felt.
And I think that's probably one
of the most important technology trends that we're looking at today.
Thank you.
I just heard the best joke about Bond Emeruwa.
I was having lunch with him just a few minutes ago,
and a Nigerian journalist comes -- and this will only make sense
if you've ever watched a James Bond movie --
and a Nigerian journalist comes up to him and goes,
"Aha, we meet again, Mr. Bond!"
(Laughter)
It was great.
mostly because I'm Nigerian and if you leave me alone,
I'll talk for like two hours.
It's been an incredible few days.
It's downhill from now on. I wanted to thank Emeka and Chris.
But also, most importantly, all the invisible people behind TED
that you just see flitting around the whole place
that have made sort of this space for such a diverse and robust conversation.
It's really amazing.
I've been in the audience.
I'm a writer, and I've been watching people with the slide shows
and scientists and bankers, and I've been feeling a bit
like a gangsta rapper at a bar mitzvah.
(Laughter)
Like, what have I got to say about all this?
And I was watching Jane [Goodall] yesterday,
and I thought it was really great, and I was watching
those incredible slides of the chimpanzees, and I thought,
"Wow. What if a chimpanzee could talk, you know? What would it say?"
My first thought was, "Well, you know, there's George Bush."
But then I thought, "Why be rude to chimpanzees?"
I guess there goes my green card.
(Laughter)
And what's become increasingly clear to me is that
we're talking about news stories about Africa;
we're not really talking about African narratives.
And it's important to make a distinction, because if the news is anything to go by,
40 percent of Americans can't -- either can't afford health insurance
or have the most inadequate health insurance,
and have a president who, despite the protest
of millions of his citizens -- even his own Congress --
continues to prosecute a senseless war.
So if news is anything to go by,
the U.S. is right there with Zimbabwe, right?
Which it isn't really, is it?
And talking about war, my girlfriend has this great t-shirt
that says, "Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity."
It's amazing, isn't it?
everything Americans come to know about being American,
isn't from the news.
because the Wall Street Journal says that the Stock Exchange
closed at this many points."
What we know about how to be who we are comes from stories.
It comes from the novels, the movies, the fashion magazines.
It comes from popular culture.
who really shape who we are. And this is important to remember,
because in Africa
the complicated questions we want to ask about
what all of this means has been asked
from the rock paintings of the San people,
through the Sundiata epics of Mali, to modern contemporary literature.
If you want to know about Africa, read our literature --
and not just "Things Fall Apart," because that would be like saying,
"I've read 'Gone with the Wind' and so I know everything about America."
That's very important.
There's a poem by Jack Gilbert called "The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart."
He says, "When the Sumerian tablets were first translated,
they were thought to be business records.
But what if they were poems and psalms?
My love is like twelve Ethiopian goats
standing still in the morning light.
Shiploads of thuja are what my body wants to say to your body.
Giraffes are this desire in the dark."
This is important.
for complication and opportunity.
The first Igbo Bible was translated from English
in about the 1800s by Bishop Crowther,
who was a Yoruba.
And it's important to know Igbo is a tonal language,
and so they'll say the word "igwe" and "igwe":
same spelling, one means "sky" or "heaven,"
and one means "bicycle" or "iron."
So "God is in heaven surrounded by His angels"
was translated as --
[Igbo].
And for some reason, in Cameroon, when they tried
to translate the Bible into Cameroonian patois,
Basically, it ends up as "God is on a bicycle with his angels."
This is good, because language complicates things.
the world in which we live, and I find that's not true.
The language actually makes the world in which we live.
Language is not -- I mean, things don't have
any mutable value by themselves; we ascribe them a value.
And language can't be understood in its abstraction.
It can only be understood in the context of story,
and everything, all of this is story.
And it's important to remember that,
because if we don't, then we become ahistorical.
We've had a lot of -- a parade of amazing ideas here.
But these are not new to Africa.
Nigeria got its independence in 1960.
The first time the possibility for independence was discussed
was in 1922, following the Aba women's market riots.
In 1967, in the middle of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War,
Dr. Njoku-Obi invented the Cholera vaccine.
So, you know, the thing is to remember that
because otherwise, 10 years from now,
we'll be back here trying to tell this story again.
the problem isn't really the stories that are being told
or which stories are being told,
the problem really is the terms of humanity
that we're willing to bring to complicate every story,
and that's really what it's all about.
Let me tell you a Nigerian joke.
Well, it's just a joke, anyway.
So there's Tom, Dick and Harry and they're working construction.
And Tom opens up his lunch box and there's rice in it,
and he goes on this rant about, "Twenty years,
my wife has been packing rice for lunch.
If she does it again tomorrow, I'm going to throw myself
off this building and kill myself."
And Dick and Harry repeat this.
The next day, Tom opens his lunchbox, there's rice,
so he throws himself off and kills himself,
and Tom, Dick and Harry follow.
And now the inquest -- you know, Tom's wife
and Dick's wife are distraught.
They wished they'd not packed rice.
But Harry's wife is confused, because she said, "You know,
Harry had been packing his own lunch for 20 years."
(Laughter)
was told about Igbo, Yoruba and Hausa,
with the Hausa being Harry.
So what seems like an eccentric if tragic joke about Harry
becomes a way to spread ethnic hatred.
My father was educated in Cork, in the University of Cork, in the '50s.
In fact, every time I read in Ireland,
people get me all mistaken and they say,
"Oh, this is Chris O'Barney from Cork."
But he was also in Oxford in the '50s,
and yet growing up as a child in Nigeria,
my father used to say to me, "You must never eat or drink
in a Yoruba person's house because they will poison you."
It makes sense now when I think about it,
you would've wanted to poison him too.
(Laughter)
of the Biafran-Nigerian Civil War, and the war ended after three years.
And I was growing up in school and the federal government
didn't want us taught about the history of the war,
because they thought it probably would make us
generate a new generation of rebels.
So I had a very inventive teacher, a Pakistani Muslim,
who wanted to teach us about this.
So what he did was to teach us Jewish Holocaust history,
and so huddled around books with photographs of people in Auschwitz,
I learned the melancholic history of my people
to young Igbo children.
Story is fluid and it belongs to nobody.
And it should come as no surprise
that my first novel at 16 was about Neo-Nazis
taking over Nigeria to institute the Fourth Reich.
It makes perfect sense.
And they were to blow up strategic targets
and take over the country, and they were foiled
by a Nigerian James Bond called Coyote Williams,
and a Jewish Nazi hunter.
And it happened over four continents.
And when the book came out, I was heralded as Africa's answer
to Frederick Forsyth, which is a dubious honor at best.
But also, the book was launched in time for me to be accused
of constructing the blueprint for a foiled coup attempt.
A lot of us are very privileged.
I grew up -- servants, cars, televisions, all that stuff.
My story of Nigeria growing up was very different from the story
I encountered in prison, and I had no language for it.
I was completely terrified, completely broken,
and kept trying to find a new language,
a new way to make sense of all of this.
Six months after that, with no explanation,
they let me go.
Now for those of you who have seen me at the buffet tables know
that it was because it was costing them too much to feed me.
(Laughter)
But I mean, I grew up with this incredible privilege,
and not just me -- millions of Nigerians
grew up with books and libraries.
In fact, we were talking last night about how all
of the steamy novels of Harold Robbins
had done more for sex education of horny teenage boys in Africa
than any sex education programs ever had.
All of those are gone.
we have on this continent: the valuable resource
of the imagination.
In the film, "Sometimes in April" by Raoul Peck,
Idris Elba is poised in a scene with his machete raised,
and he's being forced by a crowd to chop up his best friend --
fellow Rwandan Army officer, albeit a Tutsi --
played by Fraser James.
And Fraser's on his knees, arms tied behind his back,
and he's crying.
He's sniveling.
Shut him up."
And I'm not saying this to save myself,
although this would be nice. I'm doing it to save you,
"I am lost already, but not you ... not you."
This is a redemption we can all aspire to.
I really don't care anymore.
I'm more interested in the stories we tell about ourselves --
how as a writer, I find that African writers
have always been the curators of our humanity on this continent.
The question is, how do I balance narratives that are wonderful
with narratives of wounds and self-loathing?
And this is the difficulty that I face.
I am trying to move beyond political rhetoric
to a place of ethical questioning.
I am asking us to balance the idea
of our complete vulnerability with the complete notion
of transformation of what is possible.
I launched myself along with a whole generation of us
into the campaign to stop the government.
And I asked millions of people,
without questioning my right to do so,
to go up against the government.
And I watched them being locked up in prison and tear gassed.
I justified it, and I said, "This is the cost of revolution.
Have I not myself been imprisoned?
Have I not myself been beaten?"
It wasn't until later, when I was imprisoned again,
that I understood the real meaning of torture,
and how easy your humanity can be taken from you,
for the time I was engaged in war,
righteous, righteous war.
Excuse me.
and when I say this, transformation
is a difficult and slow process --
sometimes I can stand before the world and say,
"My name is Chris Abani.
I have been human six days, but only sometimes."
But this is a good thing.
It's never going to be easy.
There are no answers.
As I was telling Rachel from Google Earth,
that I had challenged my students in America --
I said, "You don't know anything about Africa, you're all idiots."
And so they said, "Tell me about Africa, Professor Abani."
So I went to Google Earth and learned about Africa.
And the truth be told, this is it, isn't it?
There are no essential Africans,
and most of us are as completely ignorant as everyone else
about the continent we come from,
and yet we want to make profound statements about it.
And I think if we can just admit that we're all trying
to approximate the truth of our own communities,
it will make for a much more nuanced
and a much more interesting conversation.
I want to believe that we can be agnostic about this,
that we can rise above all of this.
and that book broke me.
Not because I was encountering homosexual sex and love
for the first time, but because the way James wrote about it
made it impossible for me to attach otherness to it.
"Here," Jimmy said.
"Here is love, all of it."
The fact that it happens in "Another Country"
takes you quite by surprise.
My friend Ronald Gottesman says there are three kinds of people in the world:
those who can count, and those who can't.
(Laughter)
He also says that the cause of all our trouble
is the belief in an essential, pure identity:
religious, ethnic, historical, ideological.
that speaks to transformation.
It's called "Ode to the Drum," and I'll try and read it
the way Yusef would be proud to hear it read.
"Gazelle, I killed you for your skin's exquisite touch,
for how easy it is to be nailed to a board
weathered raw as white butcher paper.
Last night I heard my daughter praying for the meat here at my feet.
You know it wasn't anger that made me stop my heart till the hammer fell.
Weeks ago, you broke me as a woman
once shattered me into a song beneath her weight,
before you slouched into that grassy hush.
And now I'm tightening lashes, shaped in hide as if around a ribcage,
shaped like five bowstrings.
Ghosts cannot slip back inside the body's drum.
You've been seasoned by wind, dusk and sunlight.
Pressure can make everything whole again.
Brass nails tacked into the ebony wood,
your face has been carved five times.
I have to drive trouble in the hills.
Trouble in the valley,
and trouble by the river too.
There is no palm wine, fish, salt, or calabash.
Kadoom. Kadoom. Kadoom.
Ka-doooom.
Now I have beaten a song back into you.
Thank you.
A few words about how I got started,
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.
When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted
and very much to myself.
And, kind of as a way of surviving,
I would go into my own very personal space,
and I would make things.
I would make things for people
as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.
I would go into these private places,
and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --
and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects
is very much connected with not only the idea realm,
but also with very much the feeling realm.
And the ideas are very disparate.
and there's no real connection between one or the other,
except that they sort of come out of my brain,
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered
by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,
and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.
I fell in love with the way things moved,
so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.
And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,
and I remember when I was doing this,
I was thinking about that little rock there,
and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,
and how the characters --
so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.
And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.
So, it has to end with this --
and expressed it.
I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.
And this really came about
from having many different kinds of interests.
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,
so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery
and becoming a surgeon,
because it meant working with my hands
in a very focused, intense way.
So, I started taking art courses,
and I found a way to make sculpture
that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did
was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision
at the same time.
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.
And it's full of many little trivial end points,
like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles
and it doesn't really mean anything.
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.
The connection I have with engineering
is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.
I love to figure things out,
but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.
is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.
I gave myself the problem.
Since I'm always liking to solve problems,
I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,
and solving all of the mechanical problems
for getting this little man to walk back and forth.
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,
but I did have a sense of the gesture,
and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.
And then it was a matter of starting from one point
and sort of building to that final point.
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.
And that's a little found object.
they involve found objects.
And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.
I imagine what can be said with them.
it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.
You know, they say, never play with your food --
but I always play with things.
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,
it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.
and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --
it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.
And that's the whole piece.
where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,
and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,
and it is able to achieve the action that I want.
and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,
and I saw it explode up and out.
And --
so the way I saw this in my mind at first,
was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,
and the pieces would move far out,
and then they would begin to be pulled back
with a kind of a gravitational feel,
to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.
And they would coalesce for just a moment,
so you could perceive that there was a chair there.
For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,
and I wanted to express that.
Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,
because obviously you can't move physical matter
infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.
This whole thing is about four feet wide,
and the chair itself is only about a few inches.
and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."
So, we have a motor here on the left,
and it goes through a gear train.
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end
is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.
I'm always imagining myself in different situations.
I'm imagining myself as a machine.
What would I love?
I would love to be bathed in oil.
for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.
who wanted to have a show of erotic art,
and I didn't have any pieces.
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.
And this one I call "Machine with Grease."
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --
this is just a little four-bar linkage.
And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,
and how simply could I state something.
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear
but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.
because I'm inventing machines,
but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,
and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.
So this is a little wire-bending tool.
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,
I made that tool, and then I made this other tool
for sort of centering gears very quickly --
sort of developing my own little world of technology.
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.
It completely changed what I could do.
Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.
I just like, throw it in.
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.
So, that's a finished gear.
I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.
pieces of sculpture on the street,
and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.
and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,
and I'm going to have it --
I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'
so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me
and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "
So, that's what it does.
was every time you finish writing the word,
I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.
But I had a lot of fun.
This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways
the most complete kind of piece.
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.
And when I had this thought,
I was imagining that I would make --
I would have a whole machine theater evening,
where I would -- you would have an audience,
the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance
that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...
When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point
where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,
but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.
And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity
which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.
start off in my own mind, in my heart,
and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,
and it always feels really crude.
It's always a struggle,
but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought
out into an object, and then it's there, OK.
It means nothing at all.
The object itself just means nothing.
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,
then there's a cycle that has been completed.
And to me, that's the most important thing
because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,
out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.
So I'll just let this chair come down.
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --
the lights are really disturbing my eyes
and they're reflecting on my glasses.
I am very happy and honored to be amidst
very, very innovative and intelligent people.
I have listened to the three previous speakers,
and guess what happened?
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,
that bud is a young one.
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,
I still will say something.
because another conference is taking place in Berlin.
It is the G8 Summit.
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems
should be a massive increase in aid,
something akin to the Marshall Plan.
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.
Its largest recipients were Germany and France,
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.
An average African country receives foreign aid
to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources
from rich countries to poor countries.
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,
the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,
although they're part and parcel of our African reality,
they are not the only reality.
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.
We have civil wars only in six countries,
which means that the media are covering only six countries.
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate
through the web of despair and helplessness
that the Western media largely presents to its audience.
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.
And, as a consequence, the Western view
of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.
The wrong framing is a product of thinking
that Africa is a place of despair.
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.
We should send peacekeeping troops
to serve those who are facing a civil war.
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.
that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,
from a challenge of despair,
which is called poverty reduction,
to a challenge of hope.
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa
is not the challenge of reducing poverty.
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,
you have the international cartel of good intentions
moving onto the continent, with what?
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.
And in the process, none of these things really are productive
because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes
of Africa's fundamental problems.
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,
ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding
a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.
our second challenge will be,
who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always
about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.
So, where should we be putting the money?
We need to put money where it can productively grow.
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.
Support research institutions,
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,
for primary education, for food relief.
The entire continent has been turned into
a place of despair, in need of charity.
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me
a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,
who became rich by receiving charity?
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of
the generosity and kindness of another?
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,
it appears that what I'm stating is true.
Which country is that?
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage
depends on your internal capacity.
Africa has received many opportunities.
Many of them we haven't benefited much.
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework
and policy framework that can make it possible for us
to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.
formerly known as the Lome Convention,
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe
to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons
of sugar to the European Union market.
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,
African countries that produce beef
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,
has ever met its quota.
inability to engage the rest of the world
in a more productive relationship
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.
And all forms of intervention need support,
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,
the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.
Why should people support their government?
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,
or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities
to profit from corruption.
with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,
primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.
If the government's fiscal survival
depends on it having to raise money from its own people,
such a government is driven by self-interest
to govern in a more enlightened fashion.
It will sit with those who create wealth.
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.
The problem with the African continent
and the problem with the aid industry
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives
facing the governments in Africa.
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue
does not lie in the domestic economy,
it lies with international donors.
Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,
our governments find it more productive
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand
the incentives necessary to expand a business --
it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.
by the international community, to avoid building
productive arrangements with your own citizens,
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF
and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank
that tell them what its citizens need.
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined
from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-
implementation process in our countries.
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world
has taken over our rights as citizens,
and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.
It may have built a road, and that road
may have served a very good role.
The mistake of the international aid industry
is to pick these isolated incidents of success,
generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,
and then spread them across the whole world,
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,
the skills, the practices, the norms and habits
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --
like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --
and therefore generalize this experience
as the experience of everybody.
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing
you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,
especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,
aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.
Governments are not changing it. Why?
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.
They talk to international donors.
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries
precisely because we depend on aid.
note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid
from the international community,
in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,
and all other forms of aid.
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.
Where has all the aid gone?
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent
of its own revenue?
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.
But this shows you that the government of Uganda
is not committed to spending its own revenue
to invest in productive investments,
but rather it devotes this revenue
to paying structure of public expenditure.
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.
The military, 380 billion.
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,
takes only 18 billion.
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.
And let me show you, what does public expenditure --
rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,
by the way, who never see the president, except on television.
and even there, it is him who advises them.
Each local government is organized like the central government --
a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,
and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.
There were 56, and when our president wanted to
amend the constitution and remove term limits,
he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.
One hundred thirty-four commissions
and semi-autonomous government bodies,
all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,
this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.
that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles
at the Minister of Health headquarters.
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,
none of which has an ambulance.
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters
drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,
while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.
I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.
It should be short enough to arouse interest,
but long enough to cover the subject.
I hope I have achieved that.
We're going to talk -- my -- a new lecture, just
for TED -- and I'm going show you some illusions
that we've created for TED, and I'm going to try
to relate this to happiness. What I was thinking
about with happiness is, what gives happiness --
or happiness, which I equate with joy in my
particular area, and I think there's something very
fundamental. And I was thinking about this. And
it's in terms of both illusions and movies that we
go see and jokes and magic shows is that there's
something about these things where our
expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing
way. You go see a movie. And it has an unexpected
twist -- something that you didn't expect -- and
you find a joyful experience. You look at those
sort of illusions in my book and it's not as what
you'd expect. And there's something joyful about
it. And it's the same thing with jokes and all
these sorts of things. So, what I'm going to try
and do in my lecture is go a little bit further
and see if I can violate your expectations in a
pleasing way. I mean, sometimes expectations that
are violated are not pleasant, but I'm going to try
to do it in a pleasant way, in a very primal way,
so I can make the audience here happy.
violate your expectations. First of all, I want to
show you the particular illusion here. I want you
first of all when it pops up on the screen to
notice that the two holes are perpendicular to
each other. These are all perceptual tricks. These
are real objects that I'm going to show you. Now
I'm going to show you how it is done. I've looped
the film here so you can get a very interesting
experience. I want you to see how this illusion is
constructed, and it's going to rotate so you see
that it's inside out. Now watch, as it rotates
back, how quickly your perception snaps. OK now.
Watch it as it rotates back again. And this is a very
bright audience, all right? See if you can stop it
from happening, even though you know 100 percent it's
true that -- bam! You can't undo it. What does
that tell you about yourselves? We're going to do
it again. No doubt about it. See if you can stop
it from happening. No. It's difficult.
variety of ways about representation, about shape,
about color and so forth and it's very primal. And
it's an interesting question to ponder, why these
things -- we find these things joyful. Why would
we find them joyful? So, here's something that
Lionel did a while ago. I like these sort of
little things like this.
you would see. In other words, it's not a camera
cut. It's a perceptual trick.
OK. We can violate your expectations about
shape.
We can violate your expectations on representation
-- what an image represents. What do you see here?
How many of you here see dolphins? Raise your hand
if you see dolphins. OK, those people who raised
their hands, afterwards, the rest of the audience,
go talk to them, all right? Actually, this is the
best example of priming by experience that I know.
If you are a child under the age of 10 who
haven't been ruined yet, you will look at this
image and see dolphins. Now, some of you adults
here are saying, "What dolphins? What dolphins?"
But in fact, if you reversed the figure ground --
in other words, the dark areas here -- I forgot to
ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it, you'll
see a whole series of little dolphins. By the way,
if you're also a student at CalTech -- they also
tend to just see the dolphins. It's based on
experience.
is after all talk about design, too. This was
done by Saatchi and Saatchi, and they actually got
away with this ad in Australia. So, if you look at
this ad for beer, all those people are in sort of
provocative positions. But they got it passed, and
actually won the Clio awards, so it's funny how you can do
these things.
Remember that sort of, um. This is the joke I did
when the Florida ballot was going around. You
know, count the dots for Gore; count the dots for
Bush; count 'em again ...
experience. Here is an outside water fountain that
I created with some friends of mine, but you can
stop the water in drops and -- actually make all
the drops levitate. This is something we're
building for, you know, amusement parks and that
kind of stuff.
Now let's take a static image. Can you see this?
Do you see the middle section moving down and the
outer sections moving up? It's completely static.
It's a static image. How many people see this
illusion? It's completely static.
Right. Now, when -- it's interesting that when we
look at an image we see, you know, color, depth,
texture. And you can look at this whole scene and
analyze it. You can see the woman is in closer than
the wall and so forth. But the whole thing is
actually flat. It's painted. It's trompe l'oeil.
And it was such a good trompe l'oeil that people
got irritated when they tried to talk to the
woman and she wouldn't respond.
building in New York. So that when you see it from
this side, it looks like the balconies tilt up,
and when you walk around to the other side it
looks like the balconies go down. So there are
cases where you have mistakes in design that
incorporate illusions.
Or, you take this particular un-retouched
photograph. Now, interestingly enough, I get a lot
of emails from people who say, "Is there any
perceptual difference between males and females?"
And I really say, "No." I mean, women can navigate
through the world just as well as males can -- and
why wouldn't they? However, this is the one
illusion that women can consistently do better
than males: in matching which head because they
rely on fashion cues. They can match the hat.
design in illusions. I believe that the first
example of illusions being used purposely was by
da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye. So
that when you saw from one little angle was like
this. And this little technique got popular in the
16th century and the 17th century to disguise
hidden meanings, where you could flip the image and
see it from one little point of view like this.
But these are early incorporations of illusions
brought to -- sort of high point with Hans
Holbein's "Ambassadors." And Hans Holbein worked
for Henry VIII. This was hung on a wall where you
could walk down from the stair and you can see
this hidden skull.
designers who work with illusions to give that
element of surprise. One of my favorites is Scott
Kim. I worked with Scott to create some illusions
for TED that I hope you will enjoy. We have one
here on TED and happiness.
OK now. Arthur [Ganson] hasn't talked yet, but his is
going to be a delightful talk and he has some of
his really fantastic machines outside. And so, we
-- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur
Ganson.
was appropriate here.
And figure goes to ground.
And for the musicians.
And of course, since happiness -- we want "joy to the
world."
Now, another great designer -- he's very well
known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda. And he just
builds some fantastic things. This is simply
amazing. This is a pile of junk that when you view
it from one particular angle, you see its
reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano.
Pianist transforms to violinist.
This is really wild. This assemblage of forks,
knives and spoons and various cutlery, welded
together. It gives a shadow of a motorcycle. You learn
something in the sort of thing that I do, which
is there are people out there with a lot of time
on their hands.
creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells --
un-retouched seashells, but just by rearranging
them. He did Einstein out of dice because, after
all, Einstein said, "God does not play dice with
the universe." Bert Herzog out of un-retouched
keyboards. Will Shortz, crossword puzzle. John
Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l'oeil
cabinets.
[behind]. I want to show you quickly what I've
created, some new type of illusions. I've done
something with taking the Pixar-type illusions. So
you see these kids the same size here, running
down the hall. The two table tops of the same size.
They're looking out two directions at once. You
have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller. And
that's something for you to think about, all
right? So you see larger pieces fitting in within
smaller pieces here. Does everyone see that? Which
is impossible. You can see the two kids are
looking out simultaneously out of two different
directions at once. Now can you believe these two
table tops are the same size and shape? They are.
So, if you measured them, they would be. And as I say,
those two figures are identical in size and shape.
And it's interesting, by doing this in this sort
of rendered fashion, how much stronger the
illusions are. Any case, I hope this has brought
you a little joy and happiness, and if you're
interested in seeing more cool effects, see me
outside. I'd be happy to show you lots of things.
I write about food. I write about cooking.
I take it quite seriously,
but I'm here to talk about something
that's become very important to me in the last year or two.
It is about food, but it's not about cooking, per se.
I'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow.
I'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line, right?
But I still think that this --
(Laughter)
-- may be this year's version of this.
And why do I say it?
Because only once before has the fate of individual people
and the fate of all of humanity
been so intertwined.
There was the bomb, and there's now.
And where we go from here is going to determine
not only the quality and the length of our individual lives,
but whether, if we could see the Earth a century from now,
we'd recognize it.
It's a holocaust of a different kind,
and hiding under our desks isn't going to help.
Start with the notion that global warming
is not only real, but dangerous.
Since every scientist in the world now believes this,
and even President Bush has seen the light, or pretends to,
we can take this is a given.
After energy production, livestock is the second-highest contributor
to atmosphere-altering gases.
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas
is generated by livestock production --
more than transportation.
Now, you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts,
but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2,
and it's not just methane.
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation,
air and water pollution, water shortages and loss of biodiversity.
There's more.
Like half the antibiotics in this country
are not administered to people, but to animals.
But lists like this become kind of numbing, so let me just say this:
if you're a progressive,
if you're driving a Prius, or you're shopping green,
or you're looking for organic,
you should probably be a semi-vegetarian.
Now, I'm no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom,
but it's all in the way we use these things.
There's another piece of the puzzle,
which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday,
and one you already know.
diabetes, heart disease, stroke, some cancers --
are diseases that are far more prevalent here
than anywhere in the rest of the world.
And that's the direct result of eating a Western diet.
Our demand for meat, dairy and refined carbohydrates --
the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day --
our demand for these things, not our need, our want,
drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us.
And those calories are in foods that cause, not prevent, disease.
Now global warming was unforeseen.
We didn't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility.
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there,
but, you know, that's not such a big deal.
The current health crisis, however,
is a little more the work of the evil empire.
We were told, we were assured,
that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate,
the healthier we'd be.
is the problem, along with our paltry consumption of plants.
Now, there's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here,
but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear --
it's not the ingredients in plants, it's the plants.
It's not the beta-carotene, it's the carrot.
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health.
This evidence is overwhelming at this point.
You eat more plants, you eat less other stuff, you live longer.
Not bad.
But back to animals and junk food.
What do they have in common?
One: we don't need either of them for health.
We don't need animal products,
and we certainly don't need white bread or Coke.
Two: both have been marketed heavily,
creating unnatural demand.
We're not born craving Whoppers or Skittles.
Three: their production has been supported by government agencies
at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet.
Let's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy,
while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy,
knowing all the while that the result would be
pollution, war and rising costs.
Incredible, isn't it?
Yet they do that.
And they do this here. It's the same deal.
The sad thing is, when it comes to diet,
is that even when well-intentioned Feds
try to do right by us, they fail.
Either they're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness,
or they are puppets of agribusiness.
So, when the USDA finally acknowledged
that it was plants, rather than animals, that made people healthy,
they encouraged us, via their overly simplistic food pyramid,
to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day,
along with more carbs.
What they didn't tell us is that some carbs are better than others,
and that plants and whole grains
should be supplanting eating junk food.
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen.
And guess what?
Half the people who developed the food pyramid
have ties to agribusiness.
So, instead of substituting plants for animals,
our swollen appetites simply became larger,
and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged.
So-called low-fat diets, so-called low-carb diets --
these are not solutions.
focusing on whether food is organic or local,
or whether we're being nice to animals,
the most important issues just aren't being addressed.
Now, don't get me wrong.
I like animals,
and I don't think it's just fine to industrialize their production
and to churn them out like they were wrenches.
But there's no way to treat animals well,
when you're killing 10 billion of them a year.
That's our number. 10 billion.
If you strung all of them --
chickens, cows, pigs and lambs -- to the moon,
they'd go there and back five times, there and back.
Now, my math's a little shaky, but this is pretty good,
and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long,
but you get the idea.
That's just the United States.
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals
producing greenhouse gases and heart disease,
kindness might just be a bit of a red herring.
Let's get the numbers of the animals we're killing for eating down,
and then we'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left.
which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary.
Seriously.
And locavore, for those of you who don't know,
is someone who eats only locally grown food --
which is fine if you live in California,
but for the rest of us it's a bit of a sad joke.
Between the official story -- the food pyramid --
and the hip locavore vision,
you have two versions of how to improve our eating.
(Laughter).
The first at least is populist, and the second is elitist.
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States.
And I'm going to go through that,
at least the last hundred years or so, very quickly right now.
A hundred years ago, guess what?
Everyone was a locavore: even New York had pig farms nearby,
and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion.
Every family had a cook, usually a mom.
And those moms bought and prepared food.
It was like your romantic vision of Europe.
Margarine didn't exist.
In fact, when margarine was invented,
several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink,
so we'd all know that it was a fake.
There was no snack food, and until the '20s,
until Clarence Birdseye came along, there was no frozen food.
There were no restaurant chains.
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people,
but none of them would think to open another one.
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic.
And fancy food was entirely French.
As an aside, those of you who remember
Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations
can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide.
(Laughter)
back in those days, there was no philosophy of food.
You just ate.
You didn't claim to be anything.
There was no marketing. There were no national brands.
Vitamins had not been invented.
There were no health claims, at least not federally sanctioned ones.
Fats, carbs, proteins -- they weren't bad or good, they were food.
You ate food.
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient,
because it was an ingredient.
The cornflake hadn't been invented.
(Laughter)
The Pop-Tart, the Pringle, Cheez Whiz, none of that stuff.
Goldfish swam.
(Laughter)
It's hard to imagine. People grew food, and they ate food.
And again, everyone ate local.
In New York, an orange was a common Christmas present,
because it came all the way from Florida.
From the '30s on, road systems expanded,
trucks took the place of railroads,
fresh food began to travel more.
Oranges became common in New York.
The South and West became agricultural hubs,
and in other parts of the country, suburbs took over farmland.
The effects of this are well known. They are everywhere.
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle,
as is almost everything
from the demise of the real community
to the challenge of finding a good tomato, even in summer.
Eventually, California produced too much food to ship fresh,
so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods.
Thus arrived convenience.
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives
as a way to cut down on housework.
their mouths are watering at this point.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak, even more so, right?
(Laughter)
But this may have cut down on housework,
but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well.
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable
except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad.
I, for one -- and I'm not kidding --
didn't eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19.
Who needed it though? Meat was everywhere.
What could be easier, more filling or healthier for your family
than broiling a steak?
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally.
Rather than spending their lives eating grass,
for which their stomachs were designed,
they were forced to eat soy and corn.
They have trouble digesting those grains, of course,
but that wasn't a problem for producers.
New drugs kept them healthy.
Well, they kept them alive.
Healthy was another story.
the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress,
soy, corn and cattle became king.
And chicken soon joined them on the throne.
It was during this period that the cycle of
dietary and planetary destruction began,
the thing we're only realizing just now.
Listen to this,
between 1950 and 2000, the world's population doubled.
Meat consumption increased five-fold.
Now, someone had to eat all that stuff, so we got fast food.
And this took care of the situation resoundingly.
Home cooking remained the norm, but its quality was down the tubes.
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads, desserts and soups,
because all of them could be bought at any store.
Not that they were any good, but they were there.
Most moms cooked like mine:
a piece of broiled meat, a quickly made salad with bottled dressing,
canned soup, canned fruit salad.
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes,
or perhaps the stupidest food ever, Minute Rice.
For dessert, store-bought ice cream or cookies.
My mom is not here, so I can say this now.
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself.
(Laughter)
By the '70s, forward-thinking people
began to recognize the value of local ingredients.
We tended gardens, we became interested in organic food,
we knew or we were vegetarians.
We weren't all hippies, either.
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well.
Meanwhile, food production had become industrial. Industrial.
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally,
as if it were plastic,
food gained magical or poisonous powers, or both.
Many people became fat-phobic.
Others worshiped broccoli, as if it were God-like.
But mostly they didn't eat broccoli.
Instead they were sold on yogurt,
yogurt being almost as good as broccoli.
Except, in reality, the way the industry sold yogurt
was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream.
Similarly, let's look at a granola bar.
You think that that might be healthy food,
but in fact, if you look at the ingredient list,
it's closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal.
Sadly, it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma,
if not actually killed --
the beginning of the heyday of value-added food,
which contained as many soy and corn products
as could be crammed into it.
The chicken is fed corn, and then its meat is ground up,
and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder,
and then it's fried in corn oil.
All you do is nuke it. What could be better?
And zapped horribly, pathetically.
By the '70s, home cooking was in such a sad state
that the high fat and spice contents of foods
like McNuggets and Hot Pockets --
and we all have our favorites, actually --
made this stuff more appealing than the bland things
that people were serving at home.
At the same time, masses of women were entering the workforce,
and cooking simply wasn't important enough
for men to share the burden.
So now, you've got your pizza nights, you've got your microwave nights,
you've got your grazing nights,
you've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on.
Meat, junk food, cheese:
the very stuff that will kill you.
So, now we clamor for organic food.
That's good.
And as evidence that things can actually change,
you can now find organic food in supermarkets,
and even in fast-food outlets.
But organic food isn't the answer either,
at least not the way it's currently defined.
Let me pose you a question.
Can farm-raised salmon be organic,
when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet,
even if the feed itself is supposedly organic, and the fish themselves
are packed tightly in pens, swimming in their own filth?
And if that salmon's from Chile, and it's killed down there
and then flown 5,000 miles, whatever,
dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere?
I don't know.
Packed in Styrofoam, of course,
before landing somewhere in the United States,
and then being trucked a few hundred more miles.
This may be organic in letter, but it's surely not organic in spirit.
Now here is where we all meet.
The locavores, the organivores, the vegetarians,
the vegans, the gourmets
and those of us who are just plain interested in good food.
Even though we've come to this from different points,
we all have to act on our knowledge
to change the way that everyone thinks about food.
And this is not only an issue of social justice, as Ann Cooper said --
and, of course, she's completely right --
but it's also one of global survival.
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue,
the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food.
As I said, 18 percent of greenhouse gases
are attributed to livestock production.
How much livestock do you need to produce this?
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth,
30 percent of the Earth's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted
to raising the animals we'll eat.
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so.
are anything like what they look like now,
it's not going to be 40 years.
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do.
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life.
The most common argument is that we need nutrients --
even though we eat, on average, twice as much protein
as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends.
But listen: experts who are serious about disease reduction
recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week.
But don't we need meat to be big and strong?
Isn't meat eating essential to health?
Won't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables
turn us into godless, sissy, liberals?
(Laughter)
Some of us might think that would be a good thing.
But, no, even if we were all steroid-filled football players,
the answer is no.
In fact, there's no diet on Earth that meets
basic nutritional needs that won't promote growth,
and many will make you much healthier than ours does.
We don't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition,
we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition, and it's killing us.
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health
Americans eat 50 percent less meat --
it's not enough of a cut, but it's a start.
and what progressive people, forward-thinking people
should be doing and advocating,
along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants.
I've been writing about food more or less omnivorously --
one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years.
During that time, I've eaten
and recommended eating just about everything.
I'll never stop eating animals, I'm sure,
but I do think that for the benefit of everyone,
the time has come to stop raising them industrially
and stop eating them thoughtlessly.
The USDA is not our ally here.
We have to take matters into our own hands,
not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone --
and that's the hard part -- but by improving our own.
And that happens to be quite easy.
Less meat, less junk, more plants.
It's a simple formula: eat food.
Eat real food.
We can continue to enjoy our food, and we continue to eat well,
and we can eat even better.
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love,
and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals.
We'll reduce not only calories, but our carbon footprint.
We can make food more important, not less,
and save ourselves by doing so.
We have to choose that path.
Thank you.
Aside from keeping the rain out and producing some usable space,
architecture is nothing but a special-effects machine
that delights and disturbs the senses.
It's small and large. This is an ashtray, a water glass.
From urban planning and master planning
to theater and all sorts of stuff.
The thing that all the work has in common
is that it challenges the assumptions about conventions of space.
And these are everyday conventions,
conventions that are so obvious that we are blinded by their familiarity.
that's used in the service of creating a particular special effect.
And that is something like nothing, or something next to nothing.
It's done through a form of subtraction or obstruction or interference
in a world that we naturally sleepwalk through.
for an exhibition pavilion for the Swiss Expo 2002
on Lake Neuchatel, near Geneva.
And we wanted to use the water not only as a context,
but as a primary building material.
We wanted to make an architecture of atmosphere.
So, no walls, no roof, no purpose --
just a mass of atomized water, a big cloud.
which feeds, or has been feeding, our insatiable appetite
for visual stimulation with an ever greater digital virtuosity.
High definition, in our opinion, has become the new orthodoxy.
And we ask the question, can we use technology, high technology,
to make an expo pavilion that's decidedly low definition,
that also challenges the conventions of space and skin,
and rethinks our dependence on vision?
Water's pumped from the lake and is filtered
and shot as a fine mist through an array of high-pressure fog nozzles,
35,000 of them. And a weather station is on the structure.
It reads the shifting conditions of temperature, humidity,
wind direction, wind speed, dew point,
and distribution of water throughout.
And it's a responsive system that's trained on actual weather.
So, this is just in construction, and there's a tensegrity structure.
It's about 300 feet wide, the size of a football field,
and it sits on just four very delicate columns.
and producing kind of semi-artificial and real weather.
So, we're very interested in creating weather. I don't know why.
and then from the inside of the space
entering Blur is like stepping into a habitable medium.
It's formless, featureless, depthless, scaleless, massless,
where there is absolutely nothing to see and nothing to do.
in which all the conventions of spectacle are turned on their head.
So, the audience is dispersed,
focused attention and dramatic build-up and climax
are all replaced by a kind of attenuated attention
So here the world is put out of focus,
while our visual dependence is put into focus.
The public, you know, once disoriented
can actually ascend to the angel deck above
and then just come down under those lips into the water bar.
So, all the waters of the world are served there,
so we thought that, you know, after being at the water
and moving through the water and breathing the water,
you could also drink this building.
We really wanted to bring out
our absolute dependence on this master sense,
and maybe share our kind of sensibility with our other senses.
You know, when we did this project it was a kind of tough sell,
because the Swiss said, "Well, why are we going to spend, you know,
10 million dollars producing an effect
that we already have in natural abundance that we hate?"
And, you know, we thought -- well, we tried to convince them.
And in the end, you know, they adapted this as a national icon
that came to represent Swiss doubt, which we -- you know,
it was kind of a meaning machine
that everybody kind of laid on their own meanings off of.
Anyway, it's a temporary structure that was ultimately destroyed,
and so it's now a memory of an apparition, actually,
but it continues to live in edible form.
And this is the highest honor
to be bestowed upon an architect in Switzerland -- to have a chocolate bar.
So in the '80s and '90s, we were mostly known for independent work,
such as installation artist, architect,
commissioned projects by museums and non-for-profit organizations.
And we did a lot of media work,
also a lot of experimental theater projects.
In 2003, the Whitney mounted a retrospective of our work
that featured a lot of this work from the '80s and '90s.
However, the work itself resisted the very nature of a retrospective,
and this is just some of the stuff that was in the show.
This was a piece on tourism in the United States.
This is "Soft Sell" for 42nd Street.
This was something done at the Cartier Foundation.
"Master/Slave" at the MOMA, the project series, a piece called "Parasite."
And so there were many, many of these kinds of projects.
the problem of the retrospective
was something we were very uncomfortable with.
It's a kind of invention of the museum
And our work doesn't really resolve itself into a body in any way at all.
And one of the recurring themes, by the way, that in the work
was a kind of hostility toward the museum itself,
and asking about the conventions of the museum, like the wall, the white wall.
So, what you see here
is basically a plan of many installations that were put there.
And we actually had to install white walls
to separate these pieces, which didn't belong together.
But these white walls became a kind of target and weapon at the same time.
We used the wall to partition the 13 installations of the project
and produce a kind of acoustic and visual separation.
the red dotted line shows the track of this performing element,
which was a new piece that created -- that we created for the --
which was a robotic drill, basically, that went all the way around,
cruised the museum, went all around the walls and did a lot of damage.
So, the drill was mounted on this robotic arm.
We worked with, by the way, Honeybee Robotics. This is the brain.
Honeybee Robotics designed the Mars Driller,
while they were helping us with this.
In any case, the way it works is that
an intelligent navigator basically maps the entire surface of these walls.
So, unfolded it's about 300 linear feet.
And it randomly generates points within a three-dimensional matrix.
It selects a point, it guides the drill to that point, it pierces the dry wall,
leaving a half-inch hole before traveling to the next location.
Initially these holes were lone blemishes,
and as the exhibition continued
the walls became increasingly perforated.
opening views from gallery to gallery.
Clusters of holes randomly opened up sections of wall.
And so this was a three-month performance piece
in which the wall was made into kind of an increasingly unstable element.
And also the acoustic separation was destroyed.
Also the visual separation.
And there was also this constant background groan, which was very annoying.
And this is one of the blackout spaces
where there's a video piece that became totally not useful.
So rather than securing a neutral background for the artworks on display,
the wall now actively competed for attention.
And this acoustical nuisance and visual nuisance
basically exposed the discomfort of the work
to this encompassing nature of the retrospective.
It was really great when it started to break up all of the curatorial text.
It's the ICA -- the Institute of Contemporary Art -- in Boston,
which is on the waterfront.
And there's not enough time to really introduce the building,
but I'll simply say that the building negotiates
between this outwardly focused nature of the site --
you know, it's a really great waterfront site in Boston --
and this contradictory other desire to have an inwardly focused museum.
So, the nature of the building is that it looks at looking --
I mean that's its primary objective,
both its program and its architectural conceit.
The building incorporates the site,
but it dispenses it in very small doses
in the way that the museum is choreographed.
So, you come in and you're basically squeezed by the theater,
Then you come up in this glass elevator right near the curtain wall.
This elevator's about the size of a New York City studio apartment.
and then you could come into the theater,
which can actually deny the view or open it up and become a backdrop.
And many musicians choose to use the theater glass walls totally open.
The view is denied in the galleries
where we receive just natural light,
and then exposed again in the north gallery with a panoramic view.
The original intention of this space,
which was unfortunately never realized,
was to use lenticular glass
which allowed only a kind of perpendicular view out.
In this very narrow space that connects east and west galleries
the intention was really to not get a climax,
but to have the view stalk you,
so the view would open up as you walked from one end to the other.
This was eliminated because the view was too good,
and the mayor said, "No, we just want this open."
The architect lost here.
which is suspended from the cantilevered portion of the building.
So this is an 80-foot cantilever -- it's quite substantial.
So, it's already sticking out into space enough,
and then from that is this, is this small area called the Mediatheque.
The Mediatheque has something like 16 stations
where the public can get onto the server
and look at digital artworks or also curated artworks off the web.
And this was really a kind of very important part of this building,
and here is a point where architecture --
this is like technology-free -- architecture is only a framing device,
it only edits the harbor view, the industrial harbor
just through its walls, its floors and its ceiling,
to only expose the water itself, the texture of water,
much like a hypnotic effect created by electronic snow
or a lava lamp or something like that.
But there is just no information, it's just -- it's just hypnosis.
These are the guys that did the project in the first place, 50 years ago.
We're taking over now, doing work that ranges in scale
from small-scale repairs to major renovations and major facility expansions.
But we're doing it with a lot less testosterone.
This is the extent of the work that's to be completed by 2010.
And for the purposes of this talk,
I wanted to isolate just a part of a project that's even a part of a project
that touches a little bit on this theme of architectural special effects,
and it happens to be our current obsession,
and it plays a little bit with the purging and adding of distraction.
It's Alice Tully Hall, and it's tucked under the Juilliard Building
and descends several levels under the street.
So, this is the entrance to Tully Hall as it used to be,
before the renovation, which we just started.
And we asked ourselves, why couldn't it be exhibitionistic,
like the Met, or like some of the other buildings at Lincoln Center?
And one of the things that we were asked to do
was give it a street identity, expand the lobbies and make it visually accessible.
And this building, which is just naturally hermetic, we stripped.
the underside of three levels of expansion of Juilliard,
about 45,000 square feet -- cutting it to the angle of Broadway,
and then exposing, using that canopy to frame Tully Hall.
Wait a minute, it's just in that state, we have a long way to go.
to just talk about the hall itself,
which is kind of where we're really doing a massive amount of work.
So, the hall is a multi-purpose hall.
The clients have asked us to produce a great chamber music hall.
Now, that's really tough to do with a hall that has 1,100 seats.
Chamber and the notion of chamber has to do with salons
and small-scale performances. They asked us to bring an intimacy.
Another thing that could be fixed is the shape of the hall.
It's like a coffin, it basically sends all the sound,
like a gutter-ball effect, down the aisles.
The walls are made of absorptive surface,
half absorptive, half reflective,
which is not very good for concert sound.
was very, very important to us, to get rid of visual noise.
Because we can't eliminate a single seat,
the architecture is restricted to 18 inches.
So it's a very, very thin architecture.
First we do a kind of partial box and box separation,
to take away the distraction of the subway noise.
Next we wrap the entire hall -- almost like this Olivetti keyboard --
with a material, with a wood material
that basically covers all the surfaces:
wall, ceiling, floor, stage, steps, everything, boxes.
But it's acoustically engineered to focus the sound into the house
and back to the stage. And here's an acoustic shelf.
Looking up the hall. Just a section of the stage.
Just everything is lined, it incorporates --
every single thing that you could possibly imagine
is tucked into this high-performance skin.
But one more added feature.
everything that prevents this intimacy
which is supposed to connect the house, the audience,
with the performers, we add one little detail,
one piece of architectural excess, a special effect: lighting.
We very strongly believe that the theatrics of a concert hall
is as much in the space of intermission and the space of arrival
as it is when the concert starts.
So what we wanted to do was produce this effect,
this lighting effect,
which made us have to bioengineer the wood walls.
And what it entails is the use of resin, of this very thick resin
with a veneer of the same kind of wood that's used throughout the hall,
in a kind of seamless continuity
that wraps the hall in light, like a belt of light: rather than separating,
like a proscenium would separate the audience from performers,
that gives you a sense of what this is going to look like in full-scale.
And for us, I mean it's really kind of a very strange thing,
but the moments in the hall that the buzz kind of dies down
when the audience is waiting for the performance to begin,
very similar to the parting of curtains or the raising of a chandelier,
the walls will just exude this glow, temporarily stealing attention from the stage.
And this is Tully in construction now.
(Applause)
The Internet, the Web as we know it,
the kind of Web -- the things we're all talking about --
is already less than 5,000 days old.
So all of the things that we've seen come about,
starting, say, with satellite images of the whole Earth,
which we couldn't even imagine happening before,
all these things rolling into our lives,
just this abundance of things that are right before us,
sitting in front of our laptop, or our desktop.
It's really amazing that all this stuff is here.
(Laughter)
It's in 5,000 days, all this stuff has come.
And I know that 10 years ago,
if I had told you that this was all coming,
you would have said that that's impossible.
There's simply no economic model that that would be possible.
And if I told you it was all coming for free,
you would say, this is simply -- you're dreaming.
You're a Californian utopian. You're a wild-eyed optimist.
And yet it's here.
as I looked at what even Wired was talking about,
we thought it was going to be TV, but better.
That was the model. That was what everybody was suggesting
was going to be coming.
And it turns out that that's not what it was.
First of all, it was impossible, and it's not what it was.
it's something that was simply impossible.
It's impossible in theory, but possible in practice.
And if you take all these things that are impossible,
I think one of the things that we're learning from this era,
from this last decade, is that we have to get good at believing in the impossible,
because we're unprepared for it.
But if that's happened in the last 5,000 days,
what's going to happen in the next 5,000 days?
So, I have a kind of a simple story,
and it suggests that what we want to think about is this thing that we're making,
this thing that has happened in 5,000 days --
that's all these computers, all these handhelds,
all these cell phones, all these laptops, all these servers --
basically what we're getting out of all these connections
is we're getting one machine.
If there is only one machine, and our little handhelds and devices
are actually just little windows into those machines,
but that we're basically constructing a single, global machine.
And it turned out that this machine happens to be
the most reliable machine that we've ever made.
It has not crashed; it's running uninterrupted.
And there's almost no other machine that we've ever made
that runs the number of hours, the number of days.
5,000 days without interruption -- that's just unbelievable.
And of course, the Internet is longer than just 5,000 days;
the Web is only 5,000 days.
So, I was trying to basically make measurements.
What are the dimensions of this machine?
And I started off by calculating how many billions of clicks there are
all around the globe on all the computers.
And there is a 100 billion clicks per day.
And there's 55 trillion links between all the Web pages of the world.
and I made a quick list. Was it Chris Jordan, the photographer,
talking about numbers being so large that they're meaningless?
Well, here's a list of them. They're hard to tell,
but there's one billion PC chips on the Internet,
if you count all the chips in all the computers on the Internet.
There's two million emails per second.
So it's a very big number.
It's just a huge machine,
and it uses five percent of the global electricity on the planet.
So here's the specifications,
just as if you were to make up a spec sheet for it:
170 quadrillion transistors, 55 trillion links,
emails running at two megahertz itself,
31 kilohertz text messaging,
246 exabyte storage. That's a big disk.
That's a lot of storage, memory. Nine exabyte RAM.
And the total traffic on this
is running at seven terabytes per second.
Brewster was saying the Library of Congress is about twenty terabytes.
So every second, half of the Library of Congress
is swooshing around in this machine. It's a big machine.
55 trillion links is almost the same
as the number of synapses in your brain.
A quadrillion transistors is almost the same
as the number of neurons in your brain.
So to a first approximation, we have these things --
twenty petahertz synapse firings.
Of course, the memory is really huge.
But to a first approximation, the size of this machine is the size --
and its complexity, kind of -- to your brain.
Because in fact, that's how your brain works -- in kind of the same way that the Web works.
However, your brain isn't doubling every two years.
So if we say this machine right now that we've made
is about one HB, one human brain,
if we look at the rate that this is increasing,
30 years from now, there'll be six billion HBs.
So by the year 2040, the total processing of this machine
will exceed a total processing power of humanity,
Ray Kurzweil and others get this little chart saying that we're going to cross.
So, what about that? Well, here's a couple of things.
I have three kind of general things
I would like to say, three consequences of this.
First, that basically what this machine is doing is embodying.
We're giving it a body. And that's what we're going to do
in the next 5,000 days -- we're going to give this machine a body.
And the second thing is, we're going to restructure its architecture.
And thirdly, we're going to become completely codependent upon it.
First of all, we have all these things in our hands.
We think they're all separate devices,
but in fact, every screen in the world
is looking into the one machine.
These are all basically portals into that one machine.
The second thing is that -- some people call this the cloud,
and you're kind of touching the cloud with this.
And so in some ways, all you really need is a cloudbook.
And the cloudbook doesn't have any storage.
It's wireless. It's always connected.
There's many things about it. It becomes very simple,
and basically what you're doing is you're just touching the machine,
you're touching the cloud and you're going to compute that way.
So the machine is computing.
to the kind of old idea of centralized computing.
But everything, all the cameras, and the microphones,
and the sensors in cars
and everything is connected to this machine.
And everything will go through the Web.
And we're seeing that already with, say, phones.
Right now, phones don't go through the Web,
but they are beginning to, and they will.
And if you imagine what, say, just as an example, what Google Labs has
in terms of experiments with Google Docs, Google Spreadsheets, blah, blah, blah --
all these things are going to become Web based.
They're going through the machine.
And I am suggesting that every bit will be owned by the Web.
Right now, it's not. If you do spreadsheets and things at work,
a Word document, they aren't on the Web,
but they are going to be. They're going to be part of this machine.
They're going to speak the Web language.
They're going to talk to the machine.
The Web, in some sense, is kind of like a black hole
that's sucking up everything into it.
And so every thing will be part of the Web.
So every item, every artifact that we make, will have embedded in it
some little sliver of Web-ness and connection,
and it will be part of this machine,
so that our environment -- kind of in that ubiquitous computing sense --
our environment becomes the Web. Everything is connected.
it doesn't really matter. The point is that everything
will have embedded in it some sensor connecting it to the machine,
and so we have, basically, an Internet of things.
So you begin to think of a shoe as a chip with heels,
and a car as a chip with wheels,
because basically most of the cost of manufacturing cars
is the embedded intelligence and electronics in it, and not the materials.
A lot of people think about the new economy
as something that was going to be a disembodied,
alternative, virtual existence,
and that we would have the old economy of atoms.
But in fact, what the new economy really is
That's what we're looking forward to. That is where we're going --
this union, this convergence of the atomic and the digital.
is that where we have this sort of spectrum of media right now --
TV, film, video -- that basically becomes one media platform.
And while there's many differences in some senses,
they will share more and more in common with each other.
So that the laws of media, such as the fact that copies have no value,
the value's in the uncopiable things,
the immediacy, the authentication, the personalization.
The media wants to be liquid.
The reason why things are free is so that you can manipulate them,
not so that they are "free" as in "beer," but "free" as in "freedom."
And the network effects rule,
meaning that the more you have, the more you get.
The first fax machine -- the person who bought the first fax machine
was an idiot, because there was nobody to fax to.
But here she became an evangelist, recruiting others
to get the fax machines because it made their purchase more valuable.
Those are the effects that we're going to see.
Attention is the currency.
And the other thing about this embodiment
is that there's kind of what I call the McLuhan reversal.
McLuhan was saying, "Machines are the extensions of the human senses."
And I'm saying, "Humans are now going to be
the extended senses of the machine," in a certain sense.
So we have a trillion eyes, and ears, and touches,
through all our digital photographs and cameras.
And we see that in things like Flickr,
or Photosynth, this program from Microsoft
that will allow you to assemble a view of a touristy place
from the thousands of tourist snapshots of it.
In a certain sense, the machine is seeing through the pixels of individual cameras.
that what the Web is doing is restructuring.
And I have to warn you, that what we'll talk about is --
I'm going to give my explanation of a term you're hearing, which is a "semantic Web."
of the Internet was that it was going to link computers.
And that's what we called the Net; that was the Internet of nets.
And we saw that, where you have all the computers of the world.
And if you remember, it was a kind of green screen with cursors,
and there was really not much to do, and if you wanted to connect it,
you connected it from one computer to another computer.
And what you had to do was -- if you wanted to participate in this,
you had to share packets of information.
So you were forwarding on. You didn't have control.
It wasn't like a telephone system where you had control of a line:
you had to share packets.
So in the old one, if I wanted to go on to an airline Web page,
I went from my computer, to an FTP site, to another airline computer.
Now we have pages -- the unit has been resolved into pages,
so one page links to another page.
And if I want to go in to book a flight,
I go into the airline's flight page, the website of the airline,
and I'm linking to that page.
And what we're sharing were links, so you had to be kind of open with links.
You couldn't deny -- if someone wanted to link to you,
you couldn't stop them. You had to participate in this idea
of opening up your pages to be linked by anybody.
So that's what we were doing.
and that is where we link the data.
So, I don't know what the name of this thing is.
I'm calling it the one machine. But we're linking data.
So we're going from machine to machine,
from page to page, and now data to data.
So the difference is, is that rather than linking from page to page,
we're actually going to link from one idea on a page
to another idea, rather than to the other page.
So every idea is basically being supported --
or every item, or every noun -- is being supported by the entire Web.
It's being resolved at the level of items, or ideas, or words, if you want.
So besides physically coming out again into this idea
that it's not just virtual, it's actually going out to things.
So something will resolve down to the information
about a particular person, so every person will have a unique ID.
Every person, every item will have a something
that will be very specific, and will link
to a specific representation of that idea or item.
So now, in this new one, when I link to it,
I would link to my particular flight, my particular seat.
And so, giving an example of this thing,
I live in Pacifica, rather than -- right now Pacifica
is just sort of a name on the Web somewhere.
The Web doesn't know that that is actually a town,
and that it's a specific town that I live in,
but that's what we're going to be talking about.
It's going to link directly to --
it will know, the Web will be able to read itself
and know that that actually is a place,
and that whenever it sees that word, "Pacifica,"
it knows that it actually has a place,
latitude, longitude, a certain population.
that you'll see a lot more of.
All these things are about enabling this idea of linking to the data.
So I'll give you one kind of an example.
There's like a billion social sites on the Web.
Each time you go into there, you have to tell it again who you are
and all your friends are.
Why should you be doing that? You should just do that once,
and it should know who all your friends are.
So that's what you want, is all your friends are identified,
and you should just carry these relationships around.
All this data about you should just be conveyed,
and you should do it once and that's all that should happen.
And you should have all the networks
of all the relationships between those pieces of data.
That's what we're moving into -- where it sort of knows these things down to that level.
A semantic Web, Web 3.0, giant global graph --
we're kind of trying out what we want to call this thing.
But what's it's doing is sharing data.
So you have to be open to having your data shared, which is a much bigger step
than just sharing your Web page, or your computer.
And all these things that are going to be on this
are not just pages, they are things.
Everything we've described, every artifact or place,
will be a specific representation,
will have a specific character that can be linked to directly.
So we have this database of things.
And so there's actually a fourth thing that we have not get to,
that we won't see in the next 10 years, or 5,000 days,
but I think that's where we're going to. And as the Internet of things --
where I'm linking directly to the particular things of my seat on the plane --
that that physical thing becomes part of the Web.
And so we are in the middle of this thing
that's completely linked, down to every object
in the little sliver of a connection that it has.
that we're going to be codependent.
It's always going to be there, and the closer it is, the better.
If you allow Google to, it will tell you your search history.
And I found out by looking at it
So I am open, and being transparent to that.
And I think total personalization in this new world will require total transparency.
That is going to be the price.
If you want to have total personalization,
you have to be totally transparent.
Google. I can't remember my phone number, I'll just ask Google.
We're so dependent on this that I have now gotten to the point
where I don't even try to remember things --
I'll just Google it. It's easier to do that.
And we kind of object at first, saying, "Oh, that's awful."
But if we think about the dependency that we have on this other technology,
called the alphabet, and writing,
we're totally dependent on it, and it's transformed culture.
We cannot imagine ourselves without the alphabet and writing.
And so in the same way, we're going to not imagine ourselves
without this other machine being there.
And what is happening with this is
some kind of AI, but it's not the AI in conscious AI,
as being an expert, Larry Page told me
But when six billion humans are Googling,
who's searching who? It goes both ways.
So we are the Web, that's what this thing is.
We are going to be the machine.
So the next 5,000 days, it's not going to be the Web and only better.
Just like it wasn't TV and only better.
The next 5,000 days, it's not just going to be the Web
but only better -- it's going to be something different.
And I think it's going to be smarter.
It'll have an intelligence in there, that's not, again, conscious.
But it'll anticipate what we're doing, in a good sense.
Secondly, it's become much more personalized.
It will know us, and that's good.
And again, the price of that will be transparency.
And thirdly, it's going to become more ubiquitous
in terms of filling your entire environment, and we will be in the middle of it.
And all these devices will be portals into that.
is that we have to begin to think about this as not just "the Web, only better,"
but a new kind of stage in this development.
It looks more global. If you take this whole thing,
it is a very big machine, very reliable machine,
more reliable than its parts.
But we can also think about it as kind of a large organism.
So we might respond to it more as if this was a whole system,
more as if this wasn't a large organism
that we are going to be interacting with. It's a "One."
And I don't know what else to call it, than the One.
We'll have a better word for it.
But there's a unity of some sort that's starting to emerge.
And again, I don't want to talk about consciousness,
I want to talk about it just as if it was a little bacteria,
or a volvox, which is what that organism is.
there's only one machine, and the Web is its OS.
All screens look into the One. No bits will live outside the Web.
To share is to gain. Let the One read it.
And the One is us. We are in the One.
I appreciate your time.
(Applause)
Ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners.
Not being the musicians -- the listeners, right?
And we crave one thing,
even though we kind of don't know it all the time.
We crave to be in the room with the musician
the day it was recorded, the day it was played.
And we go to live concerts, and we get that as much as we can.
But then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded.
And it turns out the further back you go in history,
the little rougher it sounds.
And so we said, there's a solution to this.
Let's separate the performance, as a thing,
out from the recording, which was how it was made.
You know, the thing with microphones in the room and all that day.
But the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers,
and what instruments they were using.
And it's the data hidden inside the recording.
In order to do this, it's a lot of hardware and software
that runs in a very high resolution.
that looks like a nice grand piano there.
And you probably didn't realize it's going to do all these things --
but full of solenoids, and fiber optics, and computers
and all this kind of stuff. The highest resolution out of Japan.
And this just didn't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition.
And we were able to cross this line, called the uncanny valley,
in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms.
We have a process where we, you know,
kind of put it into the computer and digitize it, and then a whole lot of analysis.
And we look at every single note,
and all the attributes of those notes:
how hard they were struck, and how they were held down,
and how you move the fingers.
So we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers.
And, you know, it's a thing your piano teacher teaches you,
but we never had a science behind these kinds of things.
He died 25 years ago this year, and was born 75 years ago this year.
Was a beloved pianist, maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century.
He just got tired of being in front of an audience,
and felt like -- a performing monkey was, in fact, his term.
So he stepped back, and did nothing but the crafting of his work.
And Gould's specialty was playing Bach.
His maybe most famous recording
was something called "The Goldberg Variations."
Bach only wrote themes and variations one time.
He wrote some early pieces,
but late in his life, in his mature period,
he said, "Here's a theme -- 30 variations."
In fact, the theme isn't even the melody, it's the bass line.
And Gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about,
one in mono, and one in stereo.
And the one in mono, by the way, he used the pedal,
and as he got older, he said, "No, no, wait a minute.
I'm going to get very scientific about this, and not use the pedal."
What I'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version,
and we'll play the first couple pieces of it.
Glenn Gould, 1955.
(Music)
How about that?
(Applause)
First of all, let me get you to the end step.
This is -- we have a fairly complex process
that, you know, software and musicians and so on,
but when we're all done, we know that the ear is the final arbiter.
We can play the original in one ear, and a new recording in the other.
So I'm going to do this for you right now, what you just heard.
And in the right speaker is going to be the original recording,
and the left speaker is going to be the new recording,
actually of an instrument just like that one,
and I'm going to play them together at the same time.
(Music)
That's the original. [Unclear] That's the two together.
(Music)
there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle, right?
So, in the video world,
we've been able to invent, in our lifetimes, natural behavior.
And this is kind of another example
of putting a science behind natural behavior.
And then you heard the original.
Ultimately, I started with the experience.
And the experience is: I want to be in the room and hear the musicians.
Lots of you can afford to buy one of these.
But, if not, there is now high-definition surround sound.
And I got to tell you, if you haven't heard high-definition surround,
go down to your audio dealer, your audiophile dealer.
It's so involving compared to regular stereo.
But if you don't have that, maybe you can listen on your headphones.
And so on the same disk we have five recordings --
Sony has five recordings.
And you could listen in headphones
with this thing called binaural recording.
And it's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument,
and it's got microphones where the ears are.
And when you put on headphones, and you listen to this,
you're inside of Glenn Gould's body.
And it is a chuckle until, you know, the musicians,
who are musicians who play the piano, listen to this, say,
"I can't believe it! It's just what it's like to play the piano."
Except now you're inside Glenn Gould's body playing the piano,
and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions
and moving through the whole process.
The whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.
What you heard today was not perfect.
It's an amalgam of wood, and cast iron, and felt,
and steel strings, and all these,
and they're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity.
So when you go into the recording session,
you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to.
There's the whole action there, sitting, kind of, on the side,
and the dummy head and our recording engineers
standing around while we rebuild the piano.
Without putting dates next to these things,
step-by-step music will be turned into data,
like every field that's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years.
Audio has come very late to this game --
I'm not talking about digitizing, and bits, and re-mastering.
I'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from,
which is how it was performed.
And audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool --
they're high-resolution, and they're wired straight to our emotions,
and you can't trick them very easily.
Your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement, you know.
(Laughter)
I get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there.
The episode of "Star Trek" for me was James Daly played Methuselah --
remember this one?
And at some point he's dancing with his --
and I won't ruin the episode for you, from 1967.
Right, do you know where I'm going?
And Nimoy, I'm sorry, Spock sits down at the piano,
and he starts playing this Brahms waltz, and they all dance to it.
And then Spock turns round, he goes,
"James, I know all of the Brahms waltzes,
that we can distill styles, and templates, and formulas, and all these kinds of things,
again, that you've seen happen in the computer graphics world.
It's now coming in this world.
The transition will be this one.
It says right now, we think music is notes and how they're played.
no Glenn Gould in the room.
But yet, it was human.
every time you take out your iPod and whatever,
every time you listen to it, it's the same thing -- it's frozen.
the same song, played sadder than you did yesterday.
You want to hear it played by different musicians.
You want to hear it in different rooms and whatever.
Every time I listen to that, I get goose bumps.
Every time I listen to that recording it's like, "Oh my God,
I can't believe I'm in the same room. I can't believe this is happening."
It's a way better experience
than whatever you're used to listening to, in whatever form.
And lastly, I will wrap up with one minute of Art Tatum.
So I've really overshot my budget here.
We made a new recording of him
playing in the Shrine Auditorium in September.
It was a concert he recorded in the Shrine Auditorium in 1949.
and we flew out to Los Angeles.
And as the president of the company,
I didn't feel real comfortable about where we were.
That's a real uncomfortable feeling,
when all the equipment's come out and a whole Sony team,
and people are going to be sitting there in the audience.
And we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the Shrine,
which has not changed since 1949, still seats 6,000 people.
was perfect, because he played it for that room on that day.
And we captured all that data all over again.
And I want you to hear that right now.
And fortunately, it's right in here.
This is an encore he used to do.
(Music)
(Applause)
And that's just what the live audience did.
(Applause)
So thank you very much, Michael, thank you for the opportunity.
Dogs have interests.
They have interest sniffing each other, chasing squirrels.
And if we don't make that a reward in training, that will be a distraction.
It's always sort of struck me as really a scary thought
You cannot compete with the environment,
the dog's point of view.
there's kind of a rift in dog training at the moment
that -- on one side, we have people who think that you train a dog,
We're going to force you to act against your will, to bend to our will."
for breaking rules he didn't even know existed.
So you get a little puppy, he comes. His only crime is he grew.
When he was a little puppy, he puts his paws on your leg --
you know, isn't that nice?
And you go, "Oh, there's a good boy."
You bend down, you pat him -- you reward him for jumping up.
And they take this stuff seriously.
have several bitch amendments to male hierarchical rule.
Dogs, horses and humans --
these are the three species which are so abused in life.
And the reason is built into their behavior --
is to always come back and apologize.
Like, "Oh, I'm sorry you had to beat me. I'm really sorry, yes, it's my fault."
They are just so beatable,
hit him on the head with a rolled-up newspaper,
I could speak to you and say, "Laytay-chai, paisey, paisey."
Why aren't you responding? Oh, you don't speak Swahili.
English as a second language.
And that's how we use the food lure in the hand,
and we use food because we're dealing with owners.
"Puppy, sit."
Or they go, "Sit, sit, sit."
They're making a hand signal in front of the dog's rectum for some reason,
like the dog has a third eye there -- it's insane.
You know, "Sit, sit."
No, we go, "Puppy, sit" -- boom, it's got it in six to 10 trials.
and now the dog knows that "sit" means sit,
and you can actually communicate to a dog
in a perfectly constructed English sentence.
"Phoenix, come here, take this, and go to Jamie, please."
and I've got my own little search-and-rescue dog.
He'll find Jamie wherever he is, you know,
wherever kids are, crushing rocks by a stream or something,
and take him a little message that says,
"Hey, dinner's ready. Come in for dinner."
The dog can sniff your butt, if you like, when he wants to.
look, I throw a tennis ball; "sit," say hello to that other dog.
All I have to do is sit, and they do everything.
They open doors, they drive my car, they massage me,
they will throw tennis balls,
they will cook for me and serve the food.
It's like, if I just sit, that's my command.
Then I have my own personal doorman,
chauffeur, masseuse, chef and waiter."
And now the dog's really happy.
"Because I'm the daddy, that's why."
Sorry, no more explanation. "I'm the daddy, you're not. Sit."
And there's times, for example,
This is a life-or-death thing.
You leave this, the sanctity of your house,
and you could be hit on the street.
People here get very confused about what a punishment is.
There's several definitions of what a punishment is,
such that it's less likely to occur in the future.
plus the brother-in-law, plus the child.
And I only agreed to work with it if they promised it would stay in their house,
and they never took it outside.
The dog is actually euthanized now,
but this was a dog I worked with for a while.
When the dog would try to leave the mat,
It's not a good dog you shout at.
And a lot of my friends train really neat animals,
grizzly bears -- if you've ever seen a grizzly bear
We want a better way.
Dogs deserve better.
But for me, the reason for this actually has to do with dogs.
It has to do with watching people train puppies,
I mean, my all-time classic is another "come here" one.
The dog says, "I don't think so."
(Laughter)
I mean, who in their right mind
would think that a dog would want to approach them
when they're screaming like that?
Instead, the dog says, "I know that tone. I know that tone.
Previously, when I've approached, I've gotten punished there."
I was walking onto a plane --
this, for me, was a pivotal moment in my career,
and it really cemented what I wanted to do
with this whole puppy-training thing,
the notion of how to teach puppies in a dog-friendly way
to want to do what we want to do, so we don't have to force them.
You know, I puppy-train my child.
And the seminal moment was, I was getting on a plane in Dallas,
and in row two was a father, I presume, and a young boy about five,
kicking the back of the chair.
"Johnny, don't do that."
Kick, kick, kick.
"Johnny, don't do that." Kick, kick, kick.
I'm standing right here with my bag.
The father leans over, grabs him like this and gives him ugly face.
And ugly face is this --
when you go face-to-face with a puppy or a child,
you say, "What are you doing! Now stop it, stop it, stop it!"
And I went, "Oh my God, do I do something?"
That child has lost everything --
that one of the two people he can trust in this world
has absolutely pulled the rug from under his feet.
And I thought, "Do I tell this jerk to quit it?"
I thought, "Ian, stay out of it, stay out of it, you know, walk on."
I walked to the back of the plane,
I sat down, and a thought came to me.
If that had been a dog, I would have laid him out.
(Laughter)
If he had kicked a dog, I would have punched him out.
He kicked a child, grabs the child like this and I let it go.
These relationship skills are so easy.
I mean, we as humans, our shallowness when we choose a life-mate
based on the three Cs -- coat color, conformation, cuteness.
You know, kind of like a little robot.
This is how we go into a relationship, and it's hunky-dory for a year.
And then, a little behavior problem comes up.
No different from the dog barking.
The husband won't clear up his clothes,
or the wife's always late for meetings, whatever it is, OK?
And it then starts, and we get into this thing,
and our personal feedback -- there's two things about it.
When you watch people interacting with animals or other people,
there is very little feedback, it's too infrequent.
And when it happens, it's bad, it's nasty.
You see it's especially in families, especially with spouses,
especially with children, especially with parents.
You see it especially in the workplace,
especially from boss to employee.
It's as if there's some schadenfreude there,
that we actually take delight in people getting things wrong,
so that we can then moan and groan and bitch at them.
It really is.
We take the good for granted, and we moan and groan at the bad.
And I think this whole notion of these skills should be taught.
You know, calculus is wonderful.
When I was a kid, I was a calculus whiz.
I don't understand a thing about it now, but I could do it as a kid.
Geometry, fantastic. You know, quantum mechanics --
these are cool things.
But they don't save marriages and they don't raise children.
and what I want to do with this doggy stuff, is to teach people
that you know, your husband's just as easy to train.
Probably easier -- if you got a Rottie -- much easier to train.
Your kids are easy to train.
All you've got to do is to watch them,
to time-sample the behavior, and say, every five minutes,
you ask the question, "Is it good, or is it bad?"
If it's good, say, "That was really neat, thank you."
That is such a powerful training technique.
This should be taught in schools.
Relationships -- how do you negotiate?
How you do negotiate with your friend who wants your toy?
You know, how to prepare you for your first relationship?
How on earth about raising children?
We think how we do it -- one night in bed, we're pregnant,
and then we're raising the most important thing in life, a child.
No, this is what should be taught -- the good living, the good habits,
which are just as hard to break as bad habits.
So, that would be my wish to the future.
Ah, damn, I wanted to end exactly on time,
but I got eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two --
so thank you very much. That's my talk, thank you.
(Applause)
I have all my life wondered what "mind-boggling" meant.
After two days here, I declare myself boggled, and enormously impressed,
and feel that you are one of the great hopes --
but for the whole world.
which are the 10-to-the-18th-power -- that's a million trillion --
insects and other small creatures, and to make a plea for them.
If we were to wipe out insects alone, just that group alone, on this planet --
which we are trying hard to do --
the rest of life and humanity with it would mostly disappear from the land.
And within a few months.
Now, how did I come to this particular position of advocacy?
I had a butterfly period, a snake period, a bird period, a fish period, a cave period
and finally and definitively, an ant period.
By my college years, I was a devoted myrmecologist,
a specialist on the biology of ants,
across the great variety of life on Earth in general --
including all that it means to us as a species, how little we understand it
and how pressing a danger that our activities have created for it.
My choice is the culmination of a lifetime commitment
that began with growing up on the Gulf Coast of Alabama, on the Florida peninsula.
As far back as I can remember, I was enchanted by the natural beauty of that region
and the almost tropical exuberance of the plants and animals that grow there.
One day when I was only seven years old and fishing,
I pulled a "pinfish," they're called, with sharp dorsal spines, up too hard and fast,
and I blinded myself in one eye.
I later discovered I was also hard of hearing,
possibly congenitally, in the upper registers.
So in planning to be a professional naturalist --
I never considered anything else in my entire life --
So I turned to the teeming small creatures
that can be held between the thumb and forefinger:
In so doing, I reached a frontier of biology so strange, so rich,
that it seemed as though it exists on another planet.
In fact, we live on a mostly unexplored planet.
The great majority of organisms on Earth remain unknown to science.
biologists have, for example, added a full one-third of the known frog and other amphibian species,
to bring the current total to 5,400,
and more continue to pour in.
Two new kinds of whales have been discovered, along with two new antelopes,
dozens of monkey species and a new kind of elephant --
and even a distinct kind of gorilla.
At the extreme opposite end of the size scale, the class of marine bacteria,
the Prochlorococci -- that will be on the final exam --
although discovered only in 1988, are now recognized as likely the most abundant organisms on Earth,
and moreover, responsible for a large part of the photosynthesis that occurs in the ocean.
These bacteria were not uncovered sooner
because they are also among the smallest of all Earth's organisms --
so minute that they cannot be seen with conventional optical microscopy.
Yet life in the sea may depend on these tiny creatures.
Consider the fungi -- including mushrooms, rusts, molds and many disease-causing organisms.
60,000 species are known to science,
but more than 1.5 million have been estimated to exist.
Consider the nematode roundworm, the most abundant of all animals.
Four out of five animals on Earth are nematode worms --
if all solid materials except nematode worms were to be eliminated,
you could still see the ghostly outline of most of it in nematode worms.
About 16,000 species of nematode worms
have been discovered and diagnosed by scientists;
there could be hundreds of thousands of them, even millions, still unknown.
This vast domain of hidden biodiversity is increased still further
by the dark matter of the biological world of bacteria,
which within just the last several years
still were known from only about 6,000 species of bacteria worldwide.
But that number of bacteria species can be found in one gram of soil,
just a little handful of soil, in the 10 billion bacteria that would be there.
It's been estimated that a single ton of soil -- fertile soil --
contains approximately four million species of bacteria, all unknown.
The fact is, we don't know.
We are living on a planet with a lot of activities, with reference to our living environment,
done by faith and guess alone.
Our lives depend upon these creatures.
To take an example close to home: there are over 500 species of bacteria now known --
friendly bacteria -- living symbiotically in your mouth and throat
probably necessary to your health for holding off pathogenic bacteria.
that was made especially for this occasion.

The viruses, those quasi-organisms among which are the prophages,
the gene weavers that promote the continued evolution in the lives of the bacteria,
are a virtually unknown frontier of modern biology, a world unto themselves.
What constitutes a viral species is still unresolved,
although they're obviously of enormous importance to us.
But this much we can say: the variety of genes on the planet in viruses
scientists are like explorers in a rowboat launched onto the Pacific Ocean.
Already it is possible to sequence the entire genetic code of a bacterium in under four hours.
Soon we will be in a position to go forth in the field with sequencers on our backs --
to hunt bacteria in tiny crevices of the habitat's surface
in the way you go watching for birds with binoculars.
What will we find as we map the living world, as, finally, we get this underway seriously?
As we move past the relatively gigantic mammals, birds, frogs and plants
to the more elusive insects and other small invertebrates and then beyond
to the countless millions of organisms in the invisible living world
enveloped and living within humanity?
Already what were thought to be bacteria for generations
have been found to compose, instead, two great domains of microorganisms:
true bacteria and one-celled organisms the archaea,
which are closer than other bacteria to the eukaryota, the group that we belong to.
have begun to wonder that among the enormous and still unknown diversity of microorganisms,
one might -- just might -- find aliens among them.
True aliens, stocks that arrived from outer space.
They've had billions of years to do it,
but especially during the earliest period of biological evolution on this planet.
We do know that some bacterial species that have earthly origin
are capable of almost unimaginable extremes of temperature
and other harsh changes in environment,
including hard radiation strong enough and maintained long enough to crack the Pyrex vessels
around the growing population of bacteria.
There may be a temptation to treat the biosphere holistically
and the species that compose it as a great flux of entities
hardly worth distinguishing one from the other.
But each of these species, even the tiniest Prochlorococci,
are masterpieces of evolution.
Each has persisted for thousands to millions of years.
Each is exquisitely adapted to the environment in which it lives,
interlocked with other species to form ecosystems upon which our own lives depend
in ways we have not begun even to imagine.
We will destroy these ecosystems and the species composing them
at the peril of our own existence --
and unfortunately we are destroying them with ingenuity and ceaseless energy.
searching for rare ants found in the mountain forests of Cuba,
ants that shine in the sunlight --
metallic green or metallic blue, according to species, and one species, I discovered, metallic gold.
I found my magical ants, but only after a tough climb into the mountains
where the last of the native Cuban forests hung on,
and were then -- and still are -- being cut back.
I realized then that these species
and a large part of the other unique, marvelous animals and plants on that island --
and this is true of practically every part of the world --
which took millions of years to evolve, are in the process of disappearing forever.
And so it is everywhere one looks.
that can be summarized by the acronym "HIPPO," the animal hippo.
H is for habitat destruction, including climate change forced by greenhouse gases.
I is for the invasive species like the fire ants, the zebra mussels, broom grasses
and pathogenic bacteria and viruses that are flooding every country, and at an exponential rate -- that's the I.
The P, the first one in "HIPPO," is for pollution.
The second is for continued population, human population expansion.
And the final letter is O, for over-harvesting --
driving species into extinction by excessive hunting and fishing.
The HIPPO juggernaut we have created, if unabated, is destined --
according to the best estimates of ongoing biodiversity research --
to reduce half of Earth's still surviving animal and plant species
to extinction or critical endangerment by the end of the century.
Human-forced climate change alone -- again, if unabated --
could eliminate a quarter of surviving species during the next five decades.
What will we and all future generations lose
if much of the living environment is thus degraded?
Huge potential sources of scientific information yet to be gathered,
much of our environmental stability
and new kinds of pharmaceuticals and new products of unimaginable strength and value --
all thrown away.
in wealth, security and yes, spirituality for all time to come,
because previous cataclysms of this kind --
the last one, that ended the age of dinosaurs --
took, normally, five to 10 million years to repair.
Sadly, our knowledge of biodiversity is so incomplete
that we are at risk of losing a great deal of it before it is even discovered.
For example, even in the United States, the 200,000 species known currently
actually has been found to be only partial in coverage;
it is mostly unknown to us in basic biology.
Only about 15 percent of the known species have been studied well enough to evaluate their status.
Of the 15 percent evaluated, 20 percent are classified as "in peril,"
that is, in danger of extinction.
That's in the United States.
We are, in short, flying blind into our environmental future.
We urgently need to change this.
We need to have the biosphere properly explored
so that we can understand and competently manage it.
We need to settle down before we wreck the planet.
And we need that knowledge.
It should be thought of as a biological moonshot with a timetable.
So this brings me to my wish for TEDsters,
and to anyone else around the world who hears this talk.
I wish we will work together to help create the key tools
that we need to inspire preservation of Earth's biodiversity.
And let us call it the "Encyclopedia of Life."
What is the "Encyclopedia of Life?" A concept that has already taken hold
and is beginning to spread and be looked at seriously?
It is an encyclopedia that lives on the Internet
and is contributed to by thousands of scientists around the world.
Amateurs can do it also.
It has an indefinitely expandable page for each species.
on demand, anywhere in the world.
I've written about this idea before,
and I know there are people in this room who have expended significant effort on it in the past.
But what excites me is that since I first put forward this particular idea in that form,
science has advanced.
Technology has moved forward.
Today, the practicalities of making such an encyclopedia,
regardless of the magnitude of the information put into it, are within reach.
Indeed, in the past year, a group of influential scientific institutions
have begun mobilizing to realize this dream.
I wish you would help them.
Working together, we can make this real.
It will address transcendent qualities in the human consciousness, and sense of human need.
It will transform the science of biology in ways of obvious benefit to humanity.
And most of all, it can inspire a new generation of biologists
to continue the quest that started, for me personally, 60 years ago:
to search for life, to understand it and finally, above all, to preserve it.
(Applause)
David Gallo: This is Bill Lange. I'm Dave Gallo.
And we're going to tell you some stories from the sea here in video.
We've got some of the most incredible video of Titanic that's ever been seen,
and we're not going to show you any of it.
(Laughter)
even though it's breaking all sorts of box office records --
it's not the most exciting story from the sea.
And the problem, I think, is that we take the ocean for granted.
When you think about it, the oceans are 75 percent of the planet.
Most of the planet is ocean water.
The average depth is about two miles.
Part of the problem, I think, is we stand at the beach,
or we see images like this of the ocean,
and you look out at this great big blue expanse, and it's shimmering
and it's moving and there's waves and there's surf and there's tides,
but you have no idea for what lies in there.
And in the oceans, there are the longest mountain ranges on the planet.
Most of the animals are in the oceans.
Most of the earthquakes and volcanoes are in the sea,
at the bottom of the sea.
The biodiversity and the biodensity in the ocean is higher, in places,
than it is in the rainforests.
It's mostly unexplored, and yet there are beautiful sights like this
that captivate us and make us become familiar with it.
that you're standing at the edge of a very unfamiliar world.
We have to have a very special technology
to get into that unfamiliar world.
We use the submarine Alvin and we use cameras,
and the cameras are something that Bill Lange has developed with the help of Sony.
Marcel Proust said, "The true voyage of discovery
is not so much in seeking new landscapes as in having new eyes."
People that have partnered with us have given us new eyes,
not only on what exists --
the new landscapes at the bottom of the sea --
but also how we think about life on the planet itself.
It's one of my favorites, because it's got all sorts of working parts.
This turns out to be the longest creature in the oceans.
It gets up to about 150 feet long.
But see all those different working things?
I love that kind of stuff.
It's got these fishing lures on the bottom. They're going up and down.
It's got tentacles dangling, swirling around like that.
It's a colonial animal.
These are all individual animals
banding together to make this one creature.
And it's got these jet thrusters up in front
that it'll use in a moment, and a little light.
If you take all the big fish and schooling fish and all that,
put them on one side of the scale, put all the jelly-type of animals
on the other side, those guys win hands down.
Here's the X-wing death jelly.
(Laughter)
The bioluminescence -- they use the lights for attracting mates
and attracting prey and communicating.
We couldn't begin to show you our archival stuff from the jellies.
They come in all different sizes and shapes.
on average, and that we're real familiar with the animals
that are in the first 200 or 300 feet, but we're not familiar
with what exists from there all the way down to the bottom.
And these are the types of animals
that live in that three-dimensional space,
that micro-gravity environment that we really haven't explored.
You hear about giant squid and things like that,
but some of these animals get up to be approximately 140, 160 feet long.
They're very little understood.
You can actually see through his head.
And here he is, flapping with his ears and very gracefully going up.
We see those at all depths and even at the greatest depths.
They go from a couple of inches to a couple of feet.
They come right up to the submarine --
they'll put their eyes right up to the window and peek inside the sub.
and we're going to show you two.
In this case, we're passing down through the mid-ocean and we see creatures like this.
This is kind of like an undersea rooster.
This guy, that looks incredibly formal, in a way.
And then one of my favorites. What a face!
This is basically scientific data that you're looking at.
It's footage that we've collected for scientific purposes.
And that's one of the things that Bill's been doing,
is providing scientists with this first view of animals like this,
in the world where they belong.
They don't catch them in a net.
They're actually looking at them down in that world.
We're going to take a joystick,
sit in front of our computer, on the Earth,
and press the joystick forward, and fly around the planet.
a 40,000-mile long mountain range.
The average depth at the top of it is about a mile and a half.
And we're over the Atlantic -- that's the ridge right there --
but we're going to go across the Caribbean, Central America,
and end up against the Pacific, nine degrees north.
We make maps of these mountain ranges with sound, with sonar,
and this is one of those mountain ranges.
We're coming around a cliff here on the right.
The height of these mountains on either side of this valley
is greater than the Alps in most cases.
And there's tens of thousands of those mountains out there that haven't been mapped yet.
We're getting down further and further in scale.
And eventually, we can come up with something like this.
And you can sit in a room like this,
with a joystick and a headset, and drive a robot like that
around the bottom of the ocean in real time.
One of the things we're trying to do at Woods Hole with our partners
is to bring this virtual world --
this world, this unexplored region -- back to the laboratory.
Because we see it in bits and pieces right now.
We see it either as sound, or we see it as video,
or we see it as photographs, or we see it as chemical sensors,
but we never have yet put it all together into one interesting picture.
This is what's called a hydrothermal vent.
And what you're seeing here is a cloud of densely packed,
hydrogen-sulfide-rich water
coming out of a volcanic axis on the sea floor.
Gets up to 600, 700 degrees F, somewhere in that range.
So that's all water under the sea --
a mile and a half, two miles, three miles down.
And we knew it was volcanic back in the '60s, '70s.
And then we had some hint that these things existed
all along the axis of it, because if you've got volcanism,
water's going to get down from the sea into cracks in the sea floor,
come in contact with magma, and come shooting out hot.
We weren't really aware that it would be so rich with sulfides, hydrogen sulfides.
We didn't have any idea about these things, which we call chimneys.
Six hundred degree F water coming out of the Earth.
On either side of us are mountain ranges that are higher than the Alps,
so the setting here is very dramatic.
that thrives at 180 degrees C.
that we're seeing from the bottom of the sea,
is that the first thing we see coming out of the sea floor
after a volcanic eruption is bacteria.
And we started to wonder for a long time,
how did it all get down there?
What we find out now is that it's probably coming from inside the Earth.
Not only is it coming out of the Earth --
so, biogenesis made from volcanic activity --
but that bacteria supports these colonies of life.
The pressure here is 4,000 pounds per square inch.
A mile and a half from the surface to two miles to three miles --
no sun has ever gotten down here.
All the energy to support these life forms
is coming from inside the Earth -- so, chemosynthesis.
And you can see how dense the population is.
These are called tube worms.
But they have two types of gill structures.
One for extracting oxygen out of the deep-sea water,
another one which houses this chemosynthetic bacteria,
which takes the hydrothermal fluid --
that hot water that you saw coming out of the bottom --
and converts that into simple sugars that the tube worm can digest.
He's managed to grab a tip of these worms.
Now, they normally retract as soon as a crab touches them.
Oh! Good going.
So, as soon as a crab touches them,
they retract down into their shells, just like your fingernails.
There's a whole story being played out here
that we're just now beginning to have some idea of
because of this new camera technology.
Their foot is at about 200 degrees C
and their head is out at three degrees C,
so it's like having your hand in boiling water and your foot in freezing water.
That's how they like to live.
(Laughter)
And here's a male.
You watch. It doesn't take long before two guys here --
this one and one that will show up over here -- start to fight.
Everything you see is played out in the pitch black of the deep sea.
There are never any lights there, except the lights that we bring.
Here they go.
On one of the last dive series,
we counted 200 species in these areas --
198 were new, new species.
working at these sites, it's rather difficult to collect these animals.
And they disintegrate on the way up,
so the imagery is critical for the science.
This pressure thing really amazes me --
that these animals can exist there at a depth
with pressure enough to crush the Titanic like an empty Pepsi can.
What we saw up till now was from the Pacific.
This is from the Atlantic. Even greater depth.
You can see this shrimp is harassing this poor little guy here,
and he'll bat it away with his claw. Whack!
(Laughter)
What they're getting at is that -- on the back of this crab --
the foodstuff here is this very strange bacteria
that lives on the backs of all these animals.
And what these shrimp are trying to do
is actually harvest the bacteria from the backs of these animals.
And the crabs don't like it at all.
These long filaments that you see on the back of the crab
are actually created by the product of that bacteria.
So, the bacteria grows hair on the crab.
On the back, you see this again.
The red dot is the laser light of the submarine Alvin
to give us an idea about how far away we are from the vents.
Those are all shrimp.
You see the hot water over here, here and here, coming out.
They're clinging to a rock face
and actually scraping bacteria off that rock face.
Here's a tiny, little vent that's come out of the side of that pillar.
Those pillars get up to several stories.
So here, you've got this valley with this incredible alien landscape
of pillars and hot springs and volcanic eruptions and earthquakes,
inhabited by these very strange animals
that live only on chemical energy coming out of the ground.
They don't need the sun at all.
It's actually a light-sensing organ.
It's how they find the hydrothermal vents.
The vents are emitting a black body radiation -- an IR signature --
and so they're able to find these vents at considerable distances.
that we're calling the ribbon of life, because just even today,
as we speak, there's life being generated there from volcanic activity.
This is the first time we've ever tried this any place.
We're going to try to show you high definition from the Pacific.
We're moving up one of these pillars.
This one's several stories tall.
In it, you'll see that it's a habitat for a lot of different animals.
There's a funny kind of hot plate here, with vent water coming out of it.
So all of these are individual homes for worms.
Here's crabs here, worms here.
There are smaller animals crawling around.
Here's pagoda structures.
I think this is the neatest-looking thing.
I just can't get over this --
that you've got these little chimneys sitting here smoking away.
This stuff is toxic as hell, by the way.
You could never get a permit to dump this in the ocean,
and it's coming out all from it.
(Laughter)
It's unbelievable. It's basically sulfuric acid,
and it's being just dumped out, at incredible rates.
And animals are thriving -- and we probably came from here.
That's probably where we evolved from.
turns out to be the most simplest form of life found.
There are a number of groups that are proposing
that life evolved at these vent sites.
Although the vent sites are short-lived --
an individual site may last only 10 years or so --
as an ecosystem they've been stable for millions -- well, billions -- of years.
There's a fish sitting here.
Here's a crab with his claw right at the end of that tube worm,
waiting for that worm to stick his head out.
(Laughter)
why these animals are so active.
The worms are growing inches per week!
from a human perspective, is toxic as hell.
Not only that, but on top -- the lifeblood --
that plumbing system turns off every year or so.
Their plumbing system turns off, so the sites have to move.
And then there's earthquakes,
and then volcanic eruptions, on the order of one every five years,
that completely wipes the area out.
Despite that, these animals grow back in about a year's time.
You're talking about biodensities and biodiversity, again,
higher than the rainforest that just springs back to life.
Is it sensitive? Yes.
Is it fragile? No, it's not really very fragile.
There's a story in the sea, in the waters of the sea,
in the sediments and the rocks of the sea floor.
It's an incredible story.
What we see when we look back in time,
in those sediments and rocks, is a record of Earth history.
Everything on this planet -- everything -- works by cycles and rhythms.
The continents move apart. They come back together.
Oceans come and go. Mountains come and go. Glaciers come and go.
El Nino comes and goes. It's not a disaster, it's rhythmic.
What we're learning now, it's almost like a symphony.
It's just like music -- it really is just like music.
And what we're learning now is that
you can't listen to a five-billion-year long symphony, get to today and say,
"Stop! We want tomorrow's note to be the same as it was today."
It's absurd. It's just absurd.
So, what we've got to learn now is to find out where this planet's going
at all these different scales and work with it.
Learn to manage it.
The concept of preservation is futile.
Conservation's tougher, but we can probably get there.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
(Applause)
We really need to put the best we have to offer within reach of our children.
If we don't do that, we're going to get the generation we deserve.
They're going to learn from whatever it is they have around them.
a bunch of our activities are, in fact, in trying to get the best we have to offer
within reach of those around us, or as broadly as we can.
One is what's on the Boston Public Library.
It's kind of an inspiring statement,
and I'll go back at the end of this.
to as many people as want to read it.
And the idea of using technology is perfect for us.
I think we have the opportunity to one-up the Greeks.
they were able to build the Library of Alexandria --
the idea of a copy of every book of all the peoples of the world.
The problem was you actually had to go to Alexandria to go to it.
On the other hand, if you did, then great things happened.
I think we can one-up the Greeks and achieve something.
And I'm going to try to argue only one point today:
that universal access to all knowledge is within our grasp.
So if I'm successful, then you'll actually come away thinking,
available to anybody in the world that's ever wanted to have access to it.
and that's still being refigured out.
But I'm going to go over the technological, social
And the way I'm going to try to do this is do it like the Amazon.com website,
the books, music, video and just go step -- media type by media type,
just go and say, all right, how're we doing on this?
If you wanted to put all of the published works online
so that anybody could have it available, well, how big a problem is it?
Well, we don't really know, but the largest print library in the world
is the Library of Congress. It's 26 million volumes, 26 million volumes.
It is, by far and away, the largest print library in the world.
And a book, if you had a book, is about a megabyte,
so -- you know, if you had it in Microsoft Word.
So a megabyte, 26 million megabytes is 26 terabytes --
it goes mega-, giga-, tera-. 26 terabytes.
26 terabytes fits in a computer system that's about this big,
on spinning Linux drives, and it costs about 60,000 dollars.
So for the cost of a house -- or around here, a garage --
you can put, you can have spinning all of the words in the Library of Congress.
That's pretty neat.
You know, is it worth trying to get there?
Some of the first things that people do is they make book readers
that allow you to search inside the books, and that's kind of fun.
And you can download these things, and look around them in new and different ways.
And you can get at them remotely, if you happen to have a laptop.
There's starting to be some of these sort of page turn-y interfaces
that look a whole lot like books in certain ways,
and you can search them, make little tabs, and it's kind of cute --
still very book-like -- on your laptop.
But I don't know, reading things on a laptop --
whenever I pull up my laptop, it always feels like work.
I think that's one of the reasons why the Kindle is so great.
I don't have to feel like I'm at work to read a Kindle.
It's starting to be a little bit more specified.
But I have to say that there's older technologies that I tend to like.
I like the physical book.
put them on the Net, and then download,
print them and bind them, and end up with books again.
And it turns out to not be very hard.
We actually went off to make a bookmobile.
And they actually come out kind of nice looking.
You can actually get really good-looking books
for on the order of one penny per page, sort of the parts cost for doing this.
putting books back in people's hands again.
There are some other bookmobiles running around.
This is just before he got kicked out by the Parks Services,
for competing with the bookstore there.
In India, they've got another couple bookmobiles running around.
And this is the opening day at the Library of Alexandria,
the new Library of Alexandria, in Egypt.
It was quite popularly attended.
And kids starting to make their own books,
and a happy kid with the first book that he's ever owned.
So the idea of being able to use this technology
to end up with paper where I can handle sort of sounds a little retro,
but I think it still has its place.
And being from the Silicon Valley, sort of utopian
sort of world,
we thought, if we can make this technology work in rural Uganda,
we might have something.
So we actually got some funding from the World Bank to try it out.
And we found in about 30 days we could go and take a couple folks from Silicon Valley,
fly them to Uganda, buy a car, set up the first Internet connection
at the National Library of Uganda, figure out what they wanted,
and get a program going making books in rural Uganda.
And it actually -- so technologically, it works.
but we didn't know how to quite get them digitized.
Everybody thought the answer is, send things to India and China.
And so we've tried that, and I'll go over that in a moment.
We have one of these things now. It's completely cool.
It's all conveyor belt, and it makes a book.
And it's called the "Espresso Book Machine,"
and in about 10 minutes, you can press a button and make a book.
beyond these sort of kiosk-y things where you can get books on demand,
is some of these new little screens that are coming out.
And one of my favorites in this is the $100 laptop.
And I don't mean to steal any thunder here,
So here's one of the beta units and you can --
At 200 dots per inch, it's kind of the equivalent of a 300 dot print laser printer.
We're in good enough shape.
You actually can go and read scanned books quite easily.
But how do you go about doing all this scanning?
So we thought, okay, well, let's try out this send books to India thing.
And there was a project with, funded by the National Science Foundation --
sent a bunch of scanners, and the American libraries were supposed to send books.
Well, they didn't. They didn't want to send their books.
So we bought 100,000 books and sent them to India.
And then we learned why you don't want to send books to India.
The lesson we learned out of this is, scan your own books.
If you really care about books, you're going to scan them better,
especially if they're valuable books.
If they're new books and you can just, you know, butcher them,
because you could just buy another one,
that's not such a big deal in terms of doing high-quality scanning.
But do things that you love.
But the Indians have been scanning a lot of their own books --
about 300,000 now -- doing very well.
The Chinese did over a million, and the Egyptians are about 30,000.
How do we go and do this, and how do we get it down
so that it's a cost point that we could afford?
So we started out trying to figure out. How do we get to 10 cents?
And we tried these robot things, and they worked pretty well --
sort of these auto-page-turning things.
So anyway -- so we ended up making our own book scanner,
and with two digital, high-grade, professional digital cameras,
controlled museum lighting, so even if it's a black and white book,
you can go and get the proper intonation.
So you basically do a beautiful, respectful job.
This is not a fax, this is -- the idea is to do a beautiful job
as you're going through these libraries.
This is what it looks like at the University of Toronto.
And actually, it turns out to, you know, pay a living wage.
People seem to love it.
Yes, it's a little boring, but some people kind of get into the Zen of it.
(Laughter)
And especially if it's kind of interesting books that you care about,
in languages that you can read.
We actually have been able to do a pretty good job of this, at getting 10 cents a page.
So 10 cents a page, 300 pages in your average book, 30 dollars a book.
The Library of Congress, if you did the whole darn thing --
26 million books -- is about 750 million dollars, right?
But a million books, I think, actually would be a pretty good start,
and that would cost 30 million dollars. That's not that big a bill.
We've now got eight of these scanning centers in three countries,
and libraries are up for having their books scanned.
The Getty here is moving their books to the UCLA,
which is where we have one these scanning centers,
and scanning their out-of-copyright books, which is fabulous.
So we're starting to get the institutional responsibility.
The thing we're missing is the 10 cents.
If we can get the 10 cents, all the rest of it flows.
We've scanned about 200,000 books.
Now we're scanning about 15,000 books a month,
and it's starting to gear up another factor of two from there.
And we're starting to move out of the just out-of-copyright
into the out-of-print world.
So I think of -- we're kind of going from the out-of-copyright, library stuff,
and Amazon.com is coming from the in-print world.
And I think we'll meet in the middle some place,
and have the classic thing that you have,
which is a publishing system and a library system working in parallel.
the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute and a few other libraries
that are starting to participate in this program,
to try out this model of where does a library stop
and where does the bookstore take over.
So all in all, it's possible to do this in large scale.
We're also going back over microfilm and getting that online.
So, we can do 10 cents a page, we're going 15,000 books a month
and we've got about 250,000 books online,
counting all the other projects that are starting to add in.
So what I wanted to argue is, books are within our grasp.
The idea of taking on the whole ball of wax is not that big a deal.
Yes, it costs tens of millions, low hundreds of millions,
but one time shot and we've got basically the history of printed literature online.
And then, there's business model issues
about how to try to effectively market it and get it to people.
But it is within our grasp, technologically and law-wise,
at least for the out of print and out of copyright,
we suggest, to be able to get the whole darn thing online.
So how much is there?
Well, as best we can tell, there are about two to three million disks
having been published -- so 78s, long-playing records and CDs --
we've been able to sort of point at.
It costs about 10 dollars a piece to go and take a disk
and put it online, if you're doing things in volume.
But we've found that the rights issues are really quite thorny.
This is a fairly heavily litigated area,
so we've found that there are niches in the music world
And we've been starting to make these available by going
and offering shelf space on the Net.
except on the Net, where you can go broke.
you can lose your guitars or your house.
to anybody that has something to share that belongs in a library.
And we've been getting a lot of takers. One is the rock 'n' rollers.
The rock 'n' rollers had a tradition of sharing,
as long as nobody made any money. You could --
concert recordings, it's not the commercial recordings,
We have about 40,000 concerts, everything the Grateful Dead ever did,
up on the Net, so that people can see it and listen to this material.
So audio is possible to put up, but the rights issues are really pretty thorny.
We've got a lot of collections now --
a couple hundred thousand items -- and it's growing over time.
there are not that many of them.
As best we can tell, there are about 150,000 to 200,000 movies ever
that are really meant for a large-scale theatrical distribution. It's just not that many.
But half of those were Indian.
But anyway, it's doable,
but we've only found about a thousand of these things that --
to be out of copyright.
So we've digitized those and made those available.
But we've found that there's lots of other types of movies
that haven't really seen the light of day -- archival films.
We've found, also, a lot of political films, a lot of amateur films,
all sorts of things that are basically needing a home, a permanent home.
So we've been starting to make these available and it's grown to be very popular.
We're not quite a YouTube.
We tended towards longer-term things
and also things that people can reuse and make into new movies,
which has just been great fun.
We started recording 20 channels of television 24 hours a day.
It's sort of the biggest TiVo box you've ever seen.
It's about a petabyte, so far, of worldwide television --
Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Iraqi, Al Jazeera, BBC, CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC --
24 hours a day.
We only put one week up,
CNN was saying that Palestinians were dancing in the streets.
How can we have critical thinking without being able to quote
and being able to compare what happened in the past?
And television is dreadfully unrecorded and unquotable,
except by Jon Stewart, who does a fabulous job.
So anyway, television is, I would suggest, within our grasp.
So 15 dollars per video hour, and also about 100 dollars to 150 dollars per celluloid hour,
we're able to go and get materials online very inexpensively
and have them up on the Net.
And we've got, now, a lot of these materials.
So we've got about 100,000 pieces up there.
So books, music, video, software. There's only 50,000 titles of it.
Mostly the issues there are legal issues and breaking copy protections.
But we've worked through some of those,
but we've still got real problems in Washington.
We've been archiving the World Wide Web since 1996.
We take a snapshot of every website and all of the pages on it, every two months.
And actually, it's really been pioneered by Alexa Internet,
which donates this collection to the Internet Archive.
And we've made a Wayback Machine
that you can then go and see old websites kind of the way they were.
If you go and search on something -- this is Google.com,
the different versions of it that we have,
this is what it looks like when it was an alpha release,
and this is what it looked like at Stanford.
So anyway, you've got basically an idea of where things came from.
If there's one thing that we want to learn from the Library of Alexandria version one,
which is probably best known for burning,
is, don't just have one copy.
So we've started to -- we've made another copy of all of this
and we actually put it back in the Library of Alexandria.
So this is a picture of the Internet Archive at the Library of Alexandria.
And we now have also another copy building up in Amsterdam.
So, we should put it in the San Andreas Fault Line in San Francisco,
flood zone in Amsterdam and in the Middle East. Right, so anyway ...
so we're hedging our bets here.
If we go and put it in a couple more places, I think we'll be in good shape.
Is all of this, as we go digital, is it going to be public or private?
There's some large companies that have seen this vision,
that are doing large-scale digitization,
but they're locking up the public domain.
The question is, is that the world that we really want to live in?
What's the role of the public versus the private as things go forward?
and publishing in the future, just as we basically benefited as we were growing up?
So universal access to all knowledge --
I think it can be one of the greatest achievements of humankind,
It could be something that we're remembered for,
for millennia, for having achieved.
And as I said before, I'll end with something
that's carved above the door of the Carnegie Library.
Thank you very much.
As a clergyman,
you can imagine how
out of place I feel.
I feel like a fish out of water,
or maybe an owl out of the air.
and my friend Mark Kvamme,
who helped introduce me
to this conference,
brought several CEOs
and leaders
of some of the companies here in the Silicon Valley
to have breakfast with me, or I with them.
And I was so stimulated.
And had such -- it was an
eye-opening experience
to hear them talk about
the world that is yet to come
through technology
and science.
I know that we're near the end of this conference,
and some of you may be wondering
why they have a speaker
from the field of religion.
Richard can answer that,
because he made that decision.
coming down.
I was to address a conference
at a hotel.
And on that elevator a man said,
"I hear Billy Graham is staying in this hotel."
And another man looked in my direction and said,
"Yes, there he is. He's on this elevator with us."
And this man looked me up and down
for about 10 seconds,
and he said, "My, what an anticlimax!"
that you won't feel that these few moments with me
is not a -- is an anticlimax,
after all these tremendous
talks that you've heard,
and addresses, which I intend to listen to every one of them.
But I was
on an airplane in the east some years ago,
and the man sitting across the aisle from me
was the mayor of Charlotte, North Carolina.
His name was John Belk. Some of you will probably know him.
And there was a drunk man on there,
and he got up out of his seat two or three times,
and he was making everybody upset
by what he was trying to do.
And he was slapping the stewardess
and pinching her as she went by,
and everybody was upset with him.
And finally, John Belk said,
"Do you know who's sitting here?"
And the man said, "No, who?"
He said, "It's Billy Graham,
the preacher."
He said, "You don't say!"
And he turned to me, and he said, "Put her there!"
He said, "Your sermons have certainly helped me."
with thousands of people.
and as we've heard some of it here tonight,
I would like to live in that age
and see what is going to be.
But I won't,
because I'm 80 years old. This is my eightieth year,
and I know that my time is brief.
I have phlebitis at the moment, in both legs,
and that's the reason that I had to have a little help in getting up here,
because I have Parkinson's disease
in addition to that,
and some other problems that I won't talk about.
that we've had a technological revolution.
We've had others.
And there's one that I want to talk about.
In one generation,
the nation of the people of Israel
had a tremendous and dramatic change
that made them a great power in the Near East.
A man by the name of David
came to the throne,
and King David became one of the great leaders
of his generation.
He was a man of tremendous leadership.
He had the favor of God with him.
He was a brilliant poet,
philosopher, writer, soldier --
with strategies in battle and conflict
that people study even today.
the Hittites
had discovered the secret
of smelting and processing of iron,
and, slowly, that skill spread.
But they wouldn't allow the Israelis
to look into it, or to have any.
But David changed all of that,
and he introduced the Iron Age
to Israel.
And the Bible says that David laid up great stores of iron,
and which archaeologists have found,
that in present-day Palestine,
there are evidences of that generation.
Now, instead of crude tools
made of sticks and stones,
Israel now had iron plows,
and sickles, and hoes
and military weapons.
And in the course of one generation,
Israel was completely changed.
The introduction of iron, in some ways,
had an impact
a little bit like the microchip
has had on our generation.
And
David found
that there were many problems that technology could not solve.
And they're still with us, and you haven't solved them,
and I haven't heard anybody here speak to that.
How do we solve these three problems
that I'd like to mention?
The first one that David saw
was human evil.
Where does it come from?
How do we solve it?
Over again and again
in the Psalms,
which Gladstone said was the greatest book in the world,
David describes the evils of the human race.
And yet he says,
"He restores my soul."
Have you ever thought about what a contradiction we are?
On one hand, we can probe the deepest secrets of the universe
and dramatically push back the frontiers of technology,
as this conference vividly demonstrates.
We've seen under the sea,
three miles down,
or galaxies hundreds of billions of years
out in the future.
something is wrong.
Our battleships,
our soldiers,
are on a frontier now,
almost ready to go to war
with Iraq.
Now, what causes this?
Why do we have these wars in every generation,
and in every part of the world?
And revolutions?
We can't get along with other people,
even in our own families.
We find ourselves in the paralyzing grip
of self-destructive habits we can't break.
Racism and injustice and violence sweep our world,
bringing a tragic harvest of heartache and death.
Even the most sophisticated among us
seem powerless to break this cycle.
I would like to see Oracle
take up that,
or
some other
technological geniuses work on this.
How do we change man,
so that he doesn't lie and cheat,
and our newspapers are not filled with stories
of fraud in business or labor
or athletics or wherever?
within our hearts and our souls.
Our problem is that we are separated
from our Creator,
which we call God,
and we need to have our souls restored,
something only God can do.
Jesus said, "For out of the heart
come evil thoughts:
murders, sexual immorality,
theft, false testimonies,
slander."
The British philosopher Bertrand Russell
was not a religious man,
but he said, "It's in our hearts that the evil lies,
and it's from our hearts
that it must be plucked out."
Albert Einstein --
I was just talking to someone, when I was speaking at Princeton,
and I met
Mr. Einstein.
He didn't have a doctor's degree, because he said
nobody was qualified to give him one.
He said, "It's easier to denature plutonium
than to denature the evil spirit of man."
And many of you, I'm sure,
have thought about that
and puzzled over it.
You've seen people
take beneficial technological advances,
such as the Internet we've heard about tonight,
and twist them into something corrupting.
You've seen brilliant people devise computer viruses
that bring down whole systems.
The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology,
horribly used.
The problem is not technology.
The problem is the person or persons using it.
King David said
that he knew the depths of his own soul.
He couldn't free himself from personal problems
and personal evils
that included murder and adultery.
Yet King David sought God's forgiveness,
and said, "You can restore my soul."
that we're more than a body and a mind.
We are a soul.
And there's something inside of us
that is beyond our understanding.
That's the part of us that yearns
for God, or something more
than we find in technology.
Your soul is that part of you that
yearns for meaning in life,
and which seeks for something beyond this life.
It's the part of you that yearns, really, for God.
I find [that] young people all over the world
are searching for something.
They don't know what it is. I speak at many universities,
and I have many questions and answer periods, and
whether it's Cambridge, or Harvard,
or Oxford --
I've spoken at all of those universities.
I'm going to Harvard in about three or four --
no, it's about two months from now --
to give a lecture.
And I'll be asked the same questions that I was asked
the last few times I've been there.
And it'll be on
these questions:
where did I come from? Why am I here? Where am I going?
What's life all about? Why am I here?
there are times when you wonder that there's something else.
Thomas Edison also said,
"When you see everything that happens in the world of science,
and in the working of the universe,
you cannot deny that there's a captain on the bridge."
I remember once,
I sat beside Mrs. Gorbachev
at a White House dinner.
I went to Ambassador Dobrynin, whom I knew very well.
And I'd been to Russia several times under the Communists,
and they'd given me marvelous freedom that I didn't expect.
And I knew Mr. Dobrynin very well,
and I said,
"I'm going to sit beside Mrs. Gorbachev tonight.
What shall I talk to her about?"
And he surprised me with the answer.
He said, "Talk to her about religion and philosophy.
That's what she's really interested in."
I was a little bit surprised, but that evening
that's what we talked about,
and it was a stimulating conversation.
And afterward, she said,
"You know, I'm an atheist,
but I know that there's something up there
higher than we are."
that King David realized he could not solve
was the problem of human suffering.
Writing the oldest book in the world was Job,
and he said,
"Man is born unto trouble as the sparks fly upward."
Yes, to be sure, science has done much to push back
certain types of human suffering.
But I'm --
in a few months, I'll be 80 years of age.
I admit that I'm very grateful
for all the medical advances
that have kept me in relatively good health
all these years.
My doctors at the Mayo Clinic urged me
not to take this trip out here to this -- to be here.
I haven't given a talk in nearly four months.
And when you speak as much as I do,
three or four times a day,
you get rusty.
That's the reason I'm using this podium
and using these notes.
Every time you ever hear me on the television or somewhere,
I'm ad-libbing.
I'm not reading. I never read an address.
I never read a speech or a talk or a lecture.
I talk ad lib.
But tonight, I've
got some notes here so that if
I begin to forget,
which I do sometimes,
I've got something I can turn to.
most --
in the most advanced society in the world,
we have poverty.
We have families that self-destruct,
friends that betray us.
Unbearable psychological pressures bear down on us.
I've never met a person in the world
that didn't have a problem
or a worry.
Why do we suffer? It's an age-old question
that we haven't answered.
Yet David again and again said
that he would turn to God.
He said, "The Lord is my shepherd."
The final problem that David knew he could not solve
was death.
Many commentators have said that death
is the forbidden subject of our generation.
Most people live as if
they're never going to die.
Technology projects the myth
of control over our mortality.
We see people on our screens.
Marilyn Monroe is just as beautiful on the screen
as she was in person,
and our -- many young people think she's still alive.
They don't know that she's dead.
Or Clark Gable, or whoever it is.
The old stars, they come to life.
And they're --
they're just as great on that screen as they were in person.
But death is inevitable.
a joint session of Congress, last year.
And we were meeting in that room,
the statue room.
About 300 of them were there.
And I said, "There's one thing that we have in common in this room,
all of us together, whether Republican or Democrat,
or whoever."
I said, "We're all going to die.
And we have that in common with all these great men of the past
that are staring down at us."
And it's often difficult for young people
to understand that.
It's difficult for them to understand that they're going to die.
As the ancient writer of Ecclesiastes wrote,
he said, there's every activity under heaven.
There's a time to be born,
and there's a time to die.
I've stood at the deathbed
of several famous people,
whom you would know.
I've talked to them.
I've seen them in those agonizing moments
when they were scared to death.
death never crossed their mind.
I talked to a woman this past week
whose father
was a famous doctor.
She said he never thought of God, never talked about God,
didn't believe in God. He was an atheist.
But she said,
as he came to die,
he sat up on the side of the bed one day,
and he asked the nurse if he could see the chaplain.
And he said, for the first time in his life
he'd thought about the inevitable,
and about God.
Was there a God?
A few years ago, a university student asked me,
"What is the greatest surprise in your life?"
And I said, "The greatest surprise in my life
is the brevity of life.
It passes so fast."
But it does not need to have to be that way.
Wernher von Braun,
in the aftermath of World War II concluded, quote:
"science and religion are not antagonists.
On the contrary, they're sisters."
He put it on a personal basis.
I knew Dr. von Braun very well.
And he said, "Speaking for myself,
I can only say that the grandeur of the cosmos
serves only to confirm
a belief in the certainty of a creator."
He also said,
"In our search to know God,
I've come to believe that the life of Jesus Christ
should be the focus of our efforts and inspiration.
The reality of this life and His resurrection
is the hope of mankind."
and in France, and in different parts of the world --
105 countries it's been my privilege to speak in.
And I was invited one day to visit
Chancellor Adenauer,
who was looked upon as sort of the founder of modern Germany,
since the war.
And he once -- and he said to me,
he said, "Young man." He said,
"Do you believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ?"
And I said, "Sir, I do."
He said, "So do I."
He said, "When I leave office,
I'm going to spend my time writing a book
on why Jesus Christ rose again,
and why it's so important to believe that."
In one of his plays,
Alexander Solzhenitsyn
depicts a man dying,
who says to those gathered around his bed,
"The moment when it's terrible to feel regret
is when one is dying."
How should one live in order not to feel regret when one is dying?
asked exactly that question
in seventeenth-century France.
Pascal has been called the architect
of modern civilization.
He was a brilliant scientist
at the frontiers of mathematics,
even as a teenager.
He is viewed by many as the founder of the probability theory,
and a creator of the first model of a computer.
And of course, you are all familiar with
the computer language named for him.
Pascal explored in depth our human dilemmas
of evil, suffering and death.
He was astounded
at the phenomenon we've been considering:
that people can achieve extraordinary heights
in science, the arts and human enterprise,
yet they also are full of anger, hypocrisy
and have -- and self-hatreds.
Pascal saw us as a remarkable mixture
of genius and self-delusion.
On November 23,
1654,
Pascal had a profound religious experience.
He wrote in his journal these words:
"I submit myself,
absolutely,
to Jesus Christ, my redeemer."
two centuries later,
"Seldom has so mighty an intellect
submitted with such humility
to the authority of Jesus Christ."
Pascal came to believe not only the love and the grace of God
could bring us back into harmony,
but he believed
that his own sins and failures could be forgiven,
and that when he died he would go to a place called heaven.
He experienced it in a way that went beyond
scientific observation and reason.
It was he who penned the well-known words,
"The heart has its reasons,
which reason knows not of."
Essentially, he said this: "if you bet on God,
and open yourself to his love,
you lose nothing, even if you're wrong.
But if instead you bet that there is no God,
then you can lose it all, in this life and the life to come."
For Pascal, scientific knowledge
paled beside the knowledge of God.
The knowledge of God was far beyond
anything that ever crossed his mind.
He was ready to face him
when he died at the age of 39.
King David lived to be 70,
a long time in his era.
Yet he too had to face death,
and he wrote these words:
"even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil,
for you are with me."
of evil, suffering and death.
It can be yours, as well,
as you seek the living God
and allow him to fill your life
and give you hope for the future.
When I was 17 years of age,
I was born and reared on a farm in North Carolina.
I milked cows every morning, and I had to milk the same cows every evening
when I came home from school.
And there were 20 of them that I had --
that I was responsible for,
and I worked on the farm
and tried to keep up with my studies.
I didn't make good grades in high school.
I didn't make them in college, until
something happened in my heart.
with Christ.
He said, "I am the way, the truth and the life."
Can you imagine that? "I am the truth.
I'm the embodiment of all truth."
He was a liar.
Or he was insane.
Or he was what he claimed to be.
Which was he?
I had to make that decision.
I couldn't prove it.
I couldn't take it to a laboratory
and experiment with it.
But by faith I said, I believe him,
and he came into my heart
and changed my life.
And now I'm ready,
when I hear that call,
to go into the presence of God.
Thank you, and God bless all of you.
Thanks.
My thing with school lunch is, it's a social justice issue.
I'm the Director of Nutrition Services
for the Berkeley Unified School District. I have 90 employees
and 17 locations, 9,600 kids.
I'm doing 7,100 meals a day
and I've been doing it for two years,
trying to change how we feed kids in America.
And that's what I want to talk to you a little bit about today.
These are some of my kids with a salad bar.
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there.
Everyone says it couldn't be done.
Little kids couldn't eat off the salad bar,
big kids would spit in it -- neither happened.
like, what my vision would be.
How do we really change children's relationship to food?
And I'll tell you why we need to change it,
but we absolutely have to change it.
And what I came to understand is,
we needed to teach children
the symbiotic relationship
between a healthy planet, healthy food and healthy kids.
And that if we don't do that, the antithesis,
although we've heard otherwise,
is we're really going to become extinct,
because we're feeding our children to death.
That's my premise.
And the reason this is happening, by and large,
is because of our food system
and the way the government commodifies food,
the way the government oversees our food,
the way the USDA puts food on kids' plates
that's unhealthy, and allows unhealthy food into schools.
And by -- tacitly, all of us send our kids,
or grandchildren, or nieces, or nephews, to school
and tell them to learn, you know,
learn what's in those schools.
And when you feed these kids bad food,
that's what they're learning. So that's really what this is all about.
We now live in a country where most of us don't decide,
by and large, what we eat. We see big businesses, Monsanto and DuPont,
who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet.
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country.
These are -- 10 companies
control much of what's in our grocery stores,
much of what people eat. And that's really, really a problem.
and how I was going to change what kids ate,
I really started focusing on what we would teach them.
And the very first thing
was about regional food -- trying to eat food
from within our region.
And clearly, with what's going on with fossil fuel usage,
or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away,
as oil hits its peak oil,
you know, we really have to start thinking about whether or not
we should, or could, be moving food
1,500 miles before we eat it.
So we talked to kids about that,
and we really start to feed kids regional food.
Now, most school districts can't really afford organic food,
but we, as a nation,
have to start thinking about
consuming, growing and feeding our children
food that's not chock-full of chemicals.
We can't keep feeding our kids pesticides
and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones.
We can't keep doing that.
You know, it doesn't work.
And the results of that are kids getting sick.
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America
is consumed in animal husbandry.
We are feeding our kids antibiotics
in beef and other animal protein every day.
Seventy percent -- it's unbelievable.
And the result of it is, we have diseases.
We have things like E. coli that we can't fix,
that we can't make kids better when they get sick.
And, you know, certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed,
but it's an issue in the food supply.
One of my favorite facts is that
U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year.
That means every one of us, and our children,
consumes what would equal a five-pound bag --
those bags you have at home. If I had one here
and ripped it open,
and that pile I would have on the floor
is what we consume and feed our children every year
because of what goes into our food supply,
because of the way we consume
produce in America.
these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply,
and the USDA paid for this ad
in Time magazine.
Okay, we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT,
but we know it wasn't good for you and me.
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply.
And that has to change, you know.
The USDA cannot be seen as
the be-all and end-all of what we feed
our kids and what's allowed.
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart.
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food.
That's what I really try and get people to understand.
I really try and teach it to kids. I think it's the most important.
It's consuming food in a way
in which we'll still have a planet,
in which kids will grow up to be healthy,
and which really tries to mitigate
all the negative impacts we're seeing.
It really is just a new idea.
I mean, people toss around sustainability,
but we have to figure out what sustainability is.
we've gone from being 200 --
being 100 percent, 95 percent farmers
to less than 2 percent of farmers.
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers --
2.1 million prisoners, 1.9 million farmers.
And we spend 35,000 dollars
on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison,
and school districts spend 500 dollars a year
feeding a child.
It's no wonder, you know, we have criminals.
We're getting sick and our kids are getting sick.
It is about what we feed them.
What goes in is what we are.
We really are what we eat.
And if we continue down this path,
if we continue to feed kids bad food,
if we continue not to teach them what good food is,
what's going to happen? You know, what is going to happen?
What's going to happen to our whole medical system?
What's going to happen is,
we're going to have kids
that have a life less long than our own.
The CDC, the Center for Disease Control,
has said, of the children born in the year 2000 --
those seven- and eight-year-olds today --
one out of every three Caucasians,
one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics
are going to have diabetes in their lifetime.
And if that's not enough, they've gone on to say,
most before they graduate high school.
This means that 40 or 45 percent
of all school-aged children
could be insulin-dependent
within a decade. Within a decade.
Well, the CDC has gone further to say
that those children born in the year 2000
could be the first generation
in our country's history to die at a younger age than their parents.
And it's because of what we feed them.
Because eight-year-olds don't get to decide --
and if they do, you should be in therapy.
You know, we are responsible
for what kids eat.
But oops, maybe they're responsible for what kids eat.
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year
marketing non-nutrient foods to kids.
20 billion dollars a year. 10,000 ads most kids see.
They spend 500 dollars
for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods
that kids shouldn't eat for every one dollar
marketing healthy, nutritious food.
The result of which is kids think they're going to die
if they don't have chicken nuggets.
This is the USDA portion size, that little, tiny thing.
And the one over there, that's bigger than my head,
is what McDonald's and Burger King
and those big companies think we should eat.
And why can they serve that much?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps
and 99-cent double burgers?
It's because of the way the government commodifies food,
and the cheap corn and cheap soy
that are pushed into our food supply
that makes these non-nutrient foods
really, really cheap.
Which is why I say it's a social justice issue.
"Oh, Berkeley. Of course you can do it in Berkeley."
Well, this is the food I found 24 months ago.
This is not even food.
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids: Extremo Burritos,
corn dogs,
pizza pockets, grilled cheese sandwiches.
Everything came in plastic, in cardboard.
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter.
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen
was a can crusher, because if it didn't come in a can,
it came frozen in a box.
The USDA allows this.
The USDA allows all of this stuff.
In case you can't tell, that's, like,
pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes.
Chicken nuggets, Tater Tots, chocolate milk with high fructose,
canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal.
It ain't okay. You know what? It is not okay.
And we, all of us,
have to understand
that this is about us,
that we can make a difference here.
Now I don't know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets,
but I'm sure you're rich if you did.
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like
a heart, a giraffe, a star?
Well, Tyson did, because there's no chicken in the chicken.
And that they could figure it out,
that we could sell this stuff to kids.
You know, what's wrong with teaching kids
that chicken looks like chicken?
But this is what most schools serve.
In fact, this may be what a lot of parents serve,
as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve.
this whole paradigm with kids and food.
We really have to teach children
that chicken is not a giraffe.
You know, that vegetables
are actually colorful, that they have flavor,
that carrots grow in the ground,
that strawberries grow in the ground.
There's not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush.
You know, we have to change
the way we teach kids about these things.
There's a lot of stuff we can do. There's a lot of schools
doing farm-to-school programs. There's a lot of schools
actually getting fresh food into schools.
We have no high-fructose corn syrup,
no trans fats, no processed foods.
We're cooking from scratch every day.
We have 25 percent of our --
(Applause)
thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff
is organic and local. We cook.
Those are my hands. I get up at 4 a.m.
every day and go cook the food for the kids,
because this is what we need to do.
We can't keep serving kids
processed crap,
full of chemicals,
and expect these are going to be healthy citizens.
You're not going to get the next generation,
or the generation after, to be able to think like this
if they're not nourished.
If they're eating
chemicals all the time,
they're not going to be able to think.
They're not going to be smart.
You know what? They're just going to be sick.
is I realized that, you know, this was all pretty amazing to people,
very, very different, and I needed to market it.
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent.
And these calendars really started to lay out my program.
Now I'm in charge of all the cooking classes
and all the gardening classes in our school district.
So this is a typical menu.
This is what we're serving this week at the schools.
And you see these recipes on the side?
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes.
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes.
They also may be growing them. And we serve them in the cafeterias.
If we're going to change children's relationship to food,
it's delicious, nutritious food in the cafeterias,
hands-on experience -- you're looking in cooking and gardening classes --
and academic curriculum to tie it all together.
and I don't have any idea what to do with their pyramid,
this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top, I don't know.
You know, run up into the end of the rainbow,
I don't know what you do with it. So, I came up with my own.
This is available on my website in English and Spanish,
and it's a visual way to talk to kids about food.
The really tiny hamburger, the really big vegetables.
We have to start changing this.
We have to make kids understand
that their food choices make a big difference.
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools.
And why this is so important is
that we now have grown a generation,
maybe two, of kids where one out of every four meals
is eaten in fast food, one of every four meals is eaten in a car
and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer.
What are kids learning? Where is the family time?
Where is socialization? Where is discussion?
Where is learning to talk?
You know, we have to change it.
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating.
We have to teach kids
that Coke and Pop Tarts
aren't breakfast.
We have to teach kids that if they're on a diet
of refined sugar,
they go up and down, just like if they're on a diet of crack.
And we have to pull it all together. We have composting in all of our schools.
We have recycling in all of our schools.
You know, the things that we maybe do at home
and think are so important,
we have to teach kids about in school.
It has to be so much a part of them
that they really get it.
Because, you know what, many of us
are sort of at the end of our careers,
and we need to be giving these kids --
these young kids, the next generation --
the tools to save themselves
and save the planet.
I work with private companies
who are willing to do R & D with me,
who are willing to do distribution for me,
who are really willing to work to go into schools.
Schools are underfunded.
Most schools in America spend less
than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child.
That comes down to under five dollars an hour.
Most of you spend 10, 15 dollars an hour
for babysitters when you have them.
So we're spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system.
And if we're going to change it,
and change how we feed kids,
we really have to rethink that.
So, public and private partnerships,
advocacy groups, working with foundations.
In our school district, the way we afford this
is our school district allocates .03 percent
of the general fund
towards nutrition services. And I think if every school district
allocated a half to one percent,
we could start to really fix this program.
It's going to take more money.
Of course, it's not all about food; it's also about
kids getting exercise.
And one of the simple things we can do
is put recess before lunch.
It's sort of this "duh" thing.
You know, if you have kids coming into lunch
and all they're going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess,
you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside.
And then, at one in the afternoon, they're totally crashing.
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down
when you pick them up, because they haven't had lunch.
So if the only thing they'd have to do after lunch is go to class,
believe me, they're going to sit there and eat their lunch.
we need to educate.
We need to educate the kids.
We need to educate the staff.
I had 90 employees.
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could.
And, you know, I'm not that better off now.
But we really have to educate.
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking
about ways to teach people how to cook again,
because, of course, they don't --
because we've had this processed food in schools
and institutions for so long.
We need 40-minute lunches --
most schools have 20-minute lunches --
and lunches that are time-appropriate.
There was just a big study done, and so many schools
are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning.
That is not lunchtime.
And just remember,
at very least tacitly,
this is what we're teaching children
as what they should be doing.
I think if we're going to fix this,
one of the things we have to do
is really change how we have oversight
over the National School Lunch Program.
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA,
I think it should be under CDC.
If we started to think about food
and how we feed our kids
as a health initiative,
and we started thinking about food as health,
then I think we wouldn't have corn dogs
as lunch.
and this -- I'm sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece,
because I think this is something we all have to understand.
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars
feeding 30 million children a year.
That number probably needs to double.
People say, "Oh my God, where are we going to get 8 billion?"
In this country, we're spending 110 billion dollars a year
on fast food.
We spend 100 billion dollars a year
on diet aids.
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables,
which is why we need all the diet aids.
We spend 200 billion dollars a year
on diet-related illness today,
with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes.
200 billion.
about needing 8 billion more, it's not a lot.
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents --
that's what the government allocates for lunch.
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead.
That means we spend less than a dollar a day
on food for kids in schools --
most schools, 80 to 90 cents. In L.A., it's 56 cents.
So we're spending less than a dollar, OK, on lunch.
Now I don't know about you,
but I go to Starbucks and Pete's and places like that,
and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars.
One gourmet coffee,
one, is more --
we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids
for an entire week
in our schools.
We, as a country, should be ashamed
at that.
The richest country.
In our country,
it's the kids that need it the most,
who get this really, really lousy food.
It's the kids who have parents and grandparents
and uncles and aunts that can't even afford
to pay for school lunch that gets this food.
And those are the same kids
who are going to be getting sick.
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of.
That every single one of us,
whether we have children,
whether we care about children, whether we have nieces or nephews,
or anything --
that we can make a difference.
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids,
whether you take your kids, or grandchildren,
or nieces and nephews shopping
to a farmers' market. Just do tastings with them.
Sit down and care.
And on the macro level,
we're in what seems to be
a 19-month presidential campaign,
and of all the things we're asking
all of these potential leaders,
what about asking for the health of our children?
Thank you.
I thought I'd tell you a little about what I like to write.
And I like to immerse myself in my topics.
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig.
And I see my life as a series of experiments.
I wrote an article called "My Outsourced Life,"
where I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India,
to live my life for me.
So, they answered my emails.
They answered my phone.
They argued with my wife for me, and they read my son bedtime stories.
It was the best month of my life,
because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies.
It was a wonderful experience.
about radical honesty.
And this is a movement where --
this is started by a psychologist in Virginia,
who says that you should never, ever lie,
except maybe during poker and golf, his only exceptions.
And, more than that, whatever is on your brain
should come out of your mouth.
So, I decided I would try this for a month.
This was the worst month of my life.
(Laughter)
I do not recommend this at all.
To give you a sense of the experience,
the article was called, "I Think You're Fat."
(Laughter)
So, that was hard.
and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica
from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world,
or more precisely from Aak, which is a type of East Asian music,
all the way to Zwyiec, which is -- well, I don't want to ruin the ending.
(Laughter)
It's a very exciting twist ending, like an O. Henry novel, so I won't ruin it.
But I love that one,
because that was an experiment about how much information
one human brain could absorb.
Although, listening to Kevin Kelly, you don't have to remember anything.
You can just Google it.
So, I wasted some time there.
but I think that the most profound
and life-changing experiment that I've done
is my most recent experiment, where I spent a year
trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible,
"The Year of Living Biblically."
And I undertook this for two reasons.
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all.
As I say in my book, I'm Jewish in the same way
the Olive Garden is Italian.
(Laughter)
So, not very.
But I've become increasingly interested in religion.
I do think it's the defining issue of our time,
or one of the main ones.
And I have a son. I want to know what to teach him.
So, I decided to dive in head first, and try to live the Bible.
I'm concerned about the rise of fundamentalism,
religious fundamentalism, and people who say
they take the Bible literally, which is, according to some polls,
as high as 45 or 50 percent of America.
So I decided, what if you really did take the Bible literally?
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion
and take everything in the Bible literally,
without picking and choosing.
I had Christian bibles.
I had Jewish bibles.
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible,
where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as, "The Lord is all that,"
as opposed to what I knew it as, "The Lord is my shepherd."
and I wrote down every single law that I could find.
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules.
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of --
The Ten Commandments, love your neighbor, be fruitful and multiply.
So I wanted to follow those.
And actually, I take my projects very seriously,
because I had twins during my year,
so I definitely take my projects seriously.
of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible.
There is the law in Leviticus,
"You cannot shave the corners of your beard."
I didn't know where my corners were,
so I decided to let the whole thing grow,
and this is what I looked like by the end.
As you can imagine, I spent a lot of time at airport security.
(Laughter)
My wife wouldn't kiss me for the last two months.
So, certainly the challenge was there.
so I thought, "Sounds strange, but I'll try it."
You only know if you try it.
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts.
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight,
and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man,
then her hand shall be cut off.
So, I wanted to follow that rule.
(Laughter)
That one I followed by default,
by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby,
looking like she had a strong grip.
(Laughter)
So -- oh, there's another shot of my beard.
because it really was life changing, and incredibly challenging.
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging.
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day.
You know, I could spend a year not killing,
but spending a year not gossiping, not coveting, not lying --
you know, I live in New York, and I work as a journalist,
so this was 75, 80 percent of my day I had to do it.
because I couldn't believe how much
my behavior changed my thoughts.
This was one of the huge lessons of the year,
is that I almost pretended to be a better person,
and I became a little bit of a better person.
So I had always thought, you know, "You change your mind,
and you change your behavior," but it's often the other way around.
You change your behavior, and you change your mind.
So, you know, if you want to become more compassionate,
you visit sick people in the hospital,
and you will become more compassionate.
You donate money to a cause,
and you become emotionally involved in that cause.
So, it really was cognitive psychology --
you know, cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing.
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology,
very primitive cognitive psychology.
In the Proverbs, it says that if you smile, you will become happier,
which, as we know, is actually true.
was the rules that will get you into a little trouble
in twenty-first-century America.
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers.
(Laughter)
But it's a big part of the Bible,
so I figured I had to address it.
So, I was able to stone one adulterer.
It happened -- I was in the park, and I was dressed in my biblical clothing,
so sandals and sort of a white robe,
you know, because again, the outer affects the inner.
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind.
And this man came up to me and he said,
"Why are you dressed like that?"
And I explained my project,
and he said, "Well, I am an adulterer, are you going to stone me?"
And I said, "Well, that would be great!"
(Laughter)
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket
that I had been carrying around for weeks,
hoping for just this interaction -- and, you know, they were pebbles --
but he grabbed them out of my hand.
He was actually an elderly man, mid-70s, just so you know.
But he's still an adulterer, and still quite angry.
He grabbed them out of my hand
and threw them at my face, and I felt that I could --
eye for an eye -- I could retaliate, and throw one back at him.
to talk about, in a more serious way, these big issues.
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places,
and yet so incredibly wise in others?
How should we view the Bible?
Should we view it, you know, as original intent,
like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible?
How was the Bible written?
And actually, since this is a tech crowd,
I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me
of the Wikipedia, because it has all of these authors and editors
over hundreds of years.
And it's sort of evolved.
It's not a book that was written and came down from on high.
just a couple of the take-aways, the bigger lessons
that I learned from my year.
The first is, thou shalt not take the Bible literally.
This became very, very clear, early on.
Because if you do, then you end up acting like a crazy person,
and stoning adulterers, or -- here's another example.
Well, that's another. I did spend some time shepherding.
(Laughter)
It's a very relaxing vocation. I recommend it.
during certain times of the month, and more than that,
you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat.
And my wife thought this was very offensive,
so she sat in every seat in our apartment,
and I had to spend much of the year standing
until I bought my own seat and carried it around.
I went to the creationists' museum.
And these are the ultimate literalists.
And it was fascinating, because they were not stupid people at all.
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist.
It's just that their faith is so strong
in this literal interpretation of the Bible
that they distort all the data to fit their model.
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this.
They really did a fantastic job.
If you're ever in Kentucky,
there's, you can see a movie of the flood,
and they have sprinklers in the ceiling
that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes.
So, whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it's crazy --
they did a great job.
(Laughter)
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying,
giving these prayers of thanksgiving, which was odd for an agnostic.
But I was saying thanks all the time, every day,
and I started to change my perspective.
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things
that go right every day, that I didn't even notice,
that I took for granted, as opposed to focusing
on the three or four that went wrong.
So, this is actually a key to happiness for me,
is to just remember when I came over here,
the car didn't flip over, and I didn't trip coming up the stairs.
It's a remarkable thing.
This one was unexpected because I started the year
as an agnostic, and by the end of the year,
I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic, which I love.
And I'm trying to start it as a movement.
So, if anyone wants to join,
the basic idea is, whether or not there is a God,
there's something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness,
and that our rituals can be sacred.
The Sabbath can be sacred.
This was one of the great things about my year, doing the Sabbath,
because I am a workaholic, so having this one day
where you cannot work, it really, that changed my life.
So, this idea of sacredness, whether or not there is a God.
This one happened because
I spent a lot of time with various religious communities
throughout America because I wanted it to be more
than about my journey.
I wanted it to be about religion in America.
So, I spent time with evangelical Christians, and Hasidic Jews, and the Amish.
I'm very proud because
I think I'm the only person in America
to out Bible-talk a Jehovah's Witness.
(Laughter)
After three and a half hours, he looked at his watch,
he's like, "I gotta go."
(Laughter)
Oh, thank you very much.
Thank you. Bless you, bless you.
because I had some very preconceived notions about, for instance,
evangelical Christianity, and I found that
it's such a wide and varied movement
that it is difficult to make generalizations about it.
There's a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians,
and they focus on the red words in the Bible,
which are the ones that Jesus spoke.
That's how they printed them in the old Bibles.
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality.
They have a pamphlet that says,
"Here's what Jesus said about homosexuality,"
and you open it up, and there's nothing in it.
So, they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts,
helping poor people.
So, this was very inspiring to me.
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo.
They're very inspiring leaders, even though I disagree
with much of what they say.
This one was very unexpected because, you know,
I grew up with the scientific worldview,
and I was shocked learning how much of my life
is governed by irrational forces.
And the thing is, if they're not harmful,
they're not to be completely dismissed.
Because I learned that -- I was thinking, I was
doing all these rituals, these biblical rituals,
separating my wool and linen, and I would ask these religious people
"Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this? Why would God care?"
And they said, "We don't know,
but it's just rituals that give us meaning."
And I would say, "But that's crazy."
And they would say, "Well, what about you?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake.
If a guy from Mars came down and saw, here's one guy
blowing out the fire on top of a cake
versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics,
would the Martians say, 'Well, that guy, he makes sense,
but that guy's crazy?'"
So no, I think that rituals are, by nature, irrational.
So the key is to choose the right rituals,
the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves
are not to be dismissed.
And this one I learned because
I tried to follow everything in the Bible.
And I failed miserably.
Because you can't.
You have to pick and choose. And anyone who follows the Bible
is going to be picking and choosing.
The key is to pick and choose the right parts.
There's the phrase called cafeteria religion,
and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way,
and they'll say, "Oh, it's just cafeteria religion.
You're just picking and choosing."
But my argument is, "What's wrong with cafeterias?"
I've had some great meals at cafeterias.
I've also had some meals that make me want to dry heave.
So, it's about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion,
about tolerance, about loving your neighbor,
as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin,
or intolerance, or violence,
which are very much in the Bible as well.
So if we are to find any meaning in this book,
then we have to really engage it, and wrestle with it.
There's me reading the Bible.
That's how I hailed taxicabs.
(Laughter)
Seriously, and it worked. And yes,
that was actually a rented sheep,
so I had to return that in the morning, but it served well for a day.
So, anyway, thank you so much for letting me speak.
I have, like, a thing about sleeping.
as being a terrible detriment or something.
And now I really like sort of sitting up.
I lie awake. I think thoughts. I walk aimlessly sometimes.
I used to walk more at night.
I walk during the day, and I follow people who I think look interesting.
that I was cruising this guy, like, sort of, whatever,
come from mistakes and tricks of the eye.
Because I feel like, you know, there are so many images out there,
so many clothes out there.
And the only ones that look interesting to me
are the ones that look slightly mistaken, of course,
or very, very surprising.
And often, I'm driving in a taxi,
in some way that I'd never seen happen before.
And so I'd make the car stop, and I'd get out of the car and walk
Or if there was a hole, I'd think like, "Oh, damn.
It does not come, for me, from research.
I don't get necessarily inspired by research.
As a matter of fact,
And she came backstage and said,
And I thought, "How do I know about Stalinism?"
I know about a wolf and a bird,
actually, I do my own kind of research, you know?
I'm very, very, very inspired by movies.
The color of movies and the way light makes the colors.
Anyway, roll this little clip. I'll just show you.
I sit up at night, and I watch movies,
and I watch women in movies a lot.
And I think about, you know, their roles
and about how you have to, like, watch what your daughters look at.
Because I look at the way women are portrayed all the time,
whether they're kind of glorified in this way,
or whether they're kind of, you know, ironically glorified,
or whether they're sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated.
But for the most part, I think, like, how can I ever make anything
that is as beautiful as that image of Natalie Wood?
How can I ever make anything as beautiful as Greta Garbo?
I mean, that's just not possible. You know?
so I do it.
that I was going to meet the man of my dreams,
and that his name was going to be Eric, right?
So, you know, for years I would go to bars
and, sort of, anyone I met whose name was Eric,
was this guy in, like, a straw boater with a cane
So actually, check this out.
Very embarrassing.
about my mother.
It's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers.
I was dating this guy, right?
I was dating this guy, and it was going on for about a year,
and we were getting serious,
you know, homosexuality.
So you'll have to go check it out and come see me or something,
I feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing. You know?
I don't know, I get very, very bored. I bore very easily.
And you know, I don't say that I do everything well.
I just say that I do a lot of things, that's all.
And I kind of try not to look back, you know?
Except, I guess that's what staying up every night is about --
like, looking back and thinking, "What a fool you made of yourself."
You don't master feeling lousy about one thing.
speaking of costumes for operas.
I do work with different choreographers.
I work with Twyla Tharp a lot
and I work with Mark Morris a lot,
who is one of my best friends.
And I designed three operas with him --
the most recent one, "King Arthur."
I've been very ingrained in the dance world
Again, I don't know where inspiration comes from.
I don't know where it comes from.
I started making puppets when I was a kid.
Maybe that's where the whole inspiration thing started from: puppets.
I went to Parsons School of Design,
I don't really think of myself as a designer,
and I don't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer.
You always have to be, like, slightly bored with everything.
because it's all of these things that I love
kind of in one place.
And that was a very, very, very big part of my process.
Actually, could you roll the clip, please?
This is one of my favorite clips of Rosie O'Donnell.
And there's got to be some way to do that, Rosie.
Just because you're fabulously rich and fabulously famous,
does that mean you shouldn't have kids,
But you have to make the decision for yourself.
My kids are seven, who the hell knows?
They're going to be like 14 and in rehab.
My God, this is the shortest I've ever had!
and it said, you know, the quote was attributed to me.
And I often look at things as though they're food.
Like, I say, "Would you serve a rotten chicken?
Then how could you serve a beat-up old dress or something?
And here's the last bit.
Sorry. What?
You know how you make butter?
and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water.
And that's what people used for baking and all sorts of things.
Now the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk.
Happy TED. It's so wonderful here. I love it. I love it. I love it.
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.
And so, I have my first slide to talk about
the dawning of the universe and what I call
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,
and then following it up and trying to understand it.
when you look around, what do you see?
Well, you see this space that's created by designers
and by the work of people, but what you actually see
is a lot of material that was already here,
being reshaped in a certain form.
And so the question is: how did that material get here?
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?
It's a question of what's the continuity?
So one of the things I look at is,
how did the universe begin and shape?
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,
and you can see them there -- little pluses.
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies
you can see easily with your eye in here.
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's
an art design college conference going on,
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours
trying to figure out what's going on over here.
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --
how come there are so many galaxies?
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.
This is only 1,000 galaxies.
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,
if you had the time to scan it around --
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?
It's a very large number of galaxies.
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,
what kind of creative process and what kind of design
produced the world like that?
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.
We're going to try and follow it up.
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,
just because that's where we're making observations.
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.
Two seconds is like the present.
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.
You'd like to have a little advance warning.
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars
because it takes light long enough to go there.
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,
it's thousands of years ago.
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,
and it's two million years ago.
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,
because we don't think there were humans yet.
I mean, it just gives you the scale.
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.
there's some things even further,
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.
And so that's the sort of sequence,
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.
But you can see the edge of the Sun,
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,
which is actually incredibly uniform.
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,
but there are these very tiny variations
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.
So the way these measurements were done,
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,
and we discovered these variations.
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,
and it will make very high-resolution maps.
And that will be the sequence of understanding
the very beginning of the universe.
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,
and about the contents of the universe,
and about how the universe started in its original motions.
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.
And it's maturing up to the present time.
And there's some spectacular things.
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?
What kind of evidence do we have for that?
that are the result of this.
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.
And just put radially they're going out that way.
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.
What happens is, you take pictures
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.
So there's an interesting pattern,
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.
We only have a million galaxies, right?
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air
but, what's going on?
There's another survey which is very similar to this,
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,
so this is the real representation.
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,
it's hard to see the pattern of this.
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,
and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies
that we see out there.
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.
you can see the complicated structure, and you say,
well, how did this happen?
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?
It's not just throwing them out at random.
There's a more complicated process going on here.
How are you going to end up doing that?
And so now we're in for some serious play.
That is, we have to seriously play God,
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?
What's the kind of technique?
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients
and some simple rules,
some fluctuations and some randomness,
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.
It's called dark matter.
That is matter that doesn't interact with light
the typical way that ordinary matter does,
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,
we're going to make it white. OK?
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.
It should be called invisible matter,
but the dark matter we've made visible.
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.
This one we're zooming in on
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.
we don't live in the center of the galaxy
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.
A parsec is 3.26 light years.
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?
when we get very far out, looks very regular,
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.
So they're simple building blocks.
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.
develops into this complicated structure.
And so you know when you first saw this picture,
it didn't mean quite so much to you.
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,
but you realize they're not even the main structure.
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.
you see the light is the invisible matter,
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,
and you can see what it looks like.
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,
complicated kind of a design, right?
And it's grown up in some kind of way.
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?
How big a contractor team would you need
to put this universe together, right?
That's the issue, right?
And so here we are.
You see how the filament --
you see how several filaments are coming together,
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,
everything would be distorted,
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,
it might look to you, right?
And if you could see invisible matter, too.
in a very simple way?
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope
plus our other instruments,
were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations
eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies
and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month
in order to make just this simple visible one.
So I'm going to show you one
that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.
So you start out with teeny fluctuations
when the universe was at this point,
now four times smaller, and so forth.
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter
and it just has the dark matter in it.
And you see how the dark matter lumps up,
and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.
So there it is.
At the beginning it's very uniform.
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.
But the distances on the universe are so large
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,
in terms of its expansion.
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,
and then only things that have started forming already
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,
and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,
from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,
extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,
except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,
which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.
And that design is sort of way beyond
what our original imagination ever was.
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.
Since then we've had WMAP,
which just gives us higher angular resolution.
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down
and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out
all the major continents, but that's about it.
about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,
where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.
which is moving the plates around and so forth.
You can see that just from the map alone.
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe
we can see whether there are any non-linear effects
that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how
space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.
So that's where we are today,
and that's what I wanted to give you a flavor of.
Give you a different view about what the design
Thank you.
(Applause)
I have a story, a story that I would like to share with you.
And it's an African story.
It is a story of hope, resilience and glamour.
Then came Bollywood.
Today we have Nollywood, the third-largest film industry in the world.
In 2006 alone, almost 2,000 films were made in Nigeria.
Now, try to imagine 40, 50 films wrapped, distributed, every week
in the streets of Lagos, Nigeria and West Africa.
Some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars.
It has created thousands, if not tens of thousands of jobs.
And it's expanding.
But keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement.
This is something that happened without foreign investment,
without government aid, and actually, it happened against all odds,
in one of the most difficult moments in Nigerian economy.
The industry is 15 years old.
why, how, an Italian filmmaker based in Boston
is so interested in this story?
And so I think I have to tell you just a few words,
a few things about my personal life,
because I think there is a connection.
My grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in Zambia.
My father also lived most of his adult life in East Africa.
And I was born in Zambia.
Even though I left when I was only three years old,
I really felt that Africa was this big part of my life.
And it really was a place where I learned to walk.
I think I uttered the first words,
and my family bought their first home.
So when we came back to Italy,
and one of the things that I remember the most
is my family having this hard time to share stories.
It seemed that for our neighbors and friends,
Africa was either this exotic place, this imaginary land
that probably exists only in their imagination,
or the place of horror, famine.
And so we were always caught in this stereotype.
And I remember really this desire to talk about Africa
as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives,
and have dreams like we all have.
So when I read in a newspaper in the business page
the story of Nollywood,
I really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story
that goes against all these preconceived notions.
and actually I felt this was an inspiration for me.
I have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence
at the Center of Digital Imaging Arts at Boston University.
And we really look how digital technology is changing,
who is a veteran of National Geographic,
and told me, "You know, Franco, in 25 years of covering Africa,
I don't know if I have come across a story
that is so full of hope and so fun."
And we went to Lagos to meet Bond Emeruwa,
a wonderful, talented film director who is with us tonight.
The plan was to give you a portrait of Nollywood,
of this incredible film industry,
following Bond in his quest to make an action movie
that deals with the issue of corruption,
called "Checkpoint."
Police corruption.
And he had nine days to make it.
We thought this was a good story.
But I don't want to create too many expectations.
I would like to show you six minutes.
And these are six minutes they really prepared for the TED audience.
There are several themes from the documentary,
but they are re-edited and made for you, OK?
So I guess it's a world premier.
Man: Action.
Milverton Nwokedi: You cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in Nigeria here.
And you shoot in seven days.
We're not doing films for the elite
and the people in their glass houses.
They can afford to watch their "Robocop" and whatever.
is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living.
It's not the fancy filmmaking where you say,
oh, you want to put all the razzmatazz of Hollywood,
and where you have big budgets.
it sells, you jump onto the location again to make another film,
because if you don't make the next film, you're not going to feed.
Bond Emeruwa: So while we're entertaining, we should be able to educate.
I mean, 90 percent of the population will watch Nollywood.
I think it's the most viable vehicle right now
to pass information across a dedicated cable.
So if you're making a movie, no matter what your topic is,
put in a message in there.
Woman: You still have to report the incident.
it's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming.
I mean, there are those films that people are making for quality,
but the first thing you have to remember about this society
is that Africa still has people that live on one dollar a day,
and these are the people that really watch these films.
that has just been born in this part of the world.
Because nobody believed that Nollywood can come out of Africa.
they are stories that our people can relate to themselves.
They are stories about our people, for our people.
And consistently, they are glued to their screen
whenever they see the story.
Narrator: Suspense, fun and intrigue.
It's the blockbuster comedy.
You'll crack your ribs.
It's all about the foreign movies.
But we can do something too.
We can do something, something that when the world sees it,
they say, wow, this is Nigeria.
Man: Just arrest yourself, sergeant.
Don't embarrass yourself.
Come on. Don't run away. Come back. Come back.
It’s not just what you see in picture.
You see the person live.
You see how he talks. You see how he lives.
He influences you really good, you know.
It’s not just what you see in the picture.
It is not what you hear, you know, from the Western press.
Man: See you. Bye.
Action.
But then when I discovered the situation in my country,
at that time there was so much corruption.
For a young man to really make it out here,
you got to think of some negative things and all that,
or some kind of vices.
And I didn't want that, you know.
And I discovered that I could be successful in life as an actor,
without doing crime, without cheating nobody, without telling no lies.
Just me and God-given talent.
Man: Let's go.
OK, it's time to kick some ass.
Cover this. It's your own.
Move it.
Kevin Books Ikeduba: What I'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face.
Woman: That's why I use enough masking tape.
The masking tape will hold it.
Wat, wait. Just hold this for me.
so that it won't affect my face -- the explosion, you know.
But she's a professional. She knows what she’s doing.
I'm trying to protect my face too.
This ain't going to be my last movie.
with or without any assistance from anybody.
Man: Action.
Cut.
(Applause)
So many themes in this story.
I just can't tell you -- there’s one thing I want to tell you.
I spent, you know, several weeks with all these actors, producers,
and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable
for, you know, a Westerner, a filmmaker who works in America or in Europe.
But always with a smile, always with an enthusiasm,
that is incredible.
"I need to make movies like you need oxygen."
And I think they’re breathing.
The Nigerian filmmakers really, really, are doing what they like.
And so it's a very, very important thing for them,
and for their audiences.
A woman told me, "When I see a Nollywood film,
I can relax, I really -- I can breathe better."
that I hope will resonate with this audience.
It’s technology. I’m very interested in it
and I really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed, you know,
the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be.
Incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars.
And this has unleashed tremendous energy.
They understood it, they embraced the technology
and they run with it, and they’re successful.
I hope that the Nollywood phenomenon will go both ways.
I hope it will inspire other African nations to embrace the technology,
look at the Nigerian model, make their films, create jobs,
create a narrative for the population, something to identify,
something positive, something that really is psychological relief
and it's part of the culture.
But I really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us.
I really think it goes both ways.
"Wow, they are doing what we really want to do,
that we're actually learning from them.
No legends, no fairytales.
Nothing.
No novels.
Difficult, eh? It's meaningless.
I think that the key to a healthy society
is a thriving community of storytellers,
and I think that the Nigerian filmmakers really have proved this.
I would like you to hear their voices.
Just a few moments.
If you have an industry that puts a smile on people's face,
that’s Nollywood.
SO: I believe very soon, we’re not only going to have better movies,
we'll have that original Nigerian movie.
BE: It’s still the same basic themes.
that in the natal lifetimes,
And I really hope that there will be many, many collaborations,
where we teach each other things.
And I really hope that this will happen.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Franco, you described this as the world's third largest film industry.
What does that translate to in terms of numbers of films, really?
There is scientific data on this.
FS: 2,000 films a year. 2005 or 6,
the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone.
And we know that there are more.
So it’s safe to say that there are 2,000 films.
So imagine 45 films per week.
There are challenges. There are challenges.
There is a glut of film,
the quality has to be raised, they need to go to the next level,
these are films that are distributed directly in markets.
They are bought in video shops.
They can be rented for pennies.
It's a CD, it's a little bit more compressed image.
They started with VHS.
They actually didn't wait for, you know, the latest technology.
They started in '92, '94.
So there are 57 million VCRs in Nigeria
that play, you know, VHS and these VCDs.
It's a CD basically. It's a compact disc.
and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water. Yes.
(Laughter)
And I have to say, this really proves that storytelling,
it's a commodity, it's a staple.
There is no life without stories.
I thought I'd start with telling you or showing you the people who started [Jet Propulsion Lab].
When they were a bunch of kids,
they were kind of very imaginative, very adventurous,
as they were trying at Caltech to mix chemicals
and see which one blows up more.
Well, I don't recommend that you try to do that now.
Naturally, they blew up a shack, and Caltech, well, then,
hey, you go to the Arroyo and really do all your tests in there.
during the tea break, you know, in here.
As I said, they were adventurous people.
As a matter of fact, one of them, who was, kind of, part of a cult
which was not too far from here on Orange Grove,
and unfortunately he blew up himself because he kept mixing chemicals
and trying to figure out which ones were the best chemicals.
So, that gives you a kind of flavor
of the kind of people we have there.
We try to avoid blowing ourselves up.
Guess which one is a JPL employee in the heart of this crowd.
I tried to come like him this morning,
but as I walked out, then it was too cold,
and I said, I'd better put my shirt back on.
But more importantly, the reason I wanted to show this picture:
look where the other people are looking,
and look where he is looking.
Wherever anybody else looks, look somewhere else,
and go do something different, you know, and doing that.
And that's kind of what has been the spirit of what we are doing.
that one of my colleagues, you know, put on my wall in my office,
and it says, "Do not go where the path may lead.
Go instead where there is no path, and leave a trail."
And that's my recommendation to all of you:
look what everybody is doing, what they are doing;
go do something completely different.
Don't try to improve a little bit on what somebody else is doing,
because that doesn't get you very far.
but we also used to have a lot of parties, you know.
As you can see, one of our parties, you know, a few years ago.
But then a big difference happened about 50 years ago,
after Sputnik was launched. We launched the first American satellite,
and that's the one you see on the left in there.
And here we made 180 degrees change:
we changed from a rocket house to be an exploration house.
And that was done over a period of a couple of years,
and now we are the leading organization, you know,
exploring space on all of your behalf.
sometimes there are setbacks.
So you see, on the bottom, that rocket was supposed to go upward;
somehow it ended going sideways.
So that's what we call the misguided missile.
But then also, just to celebrate that,
we started an event at JPL for "Miss Guided Missile."
there used to be competition and parades and so on.
It's not very appropriate to do it now. Some people tell me to do it;
I think, well, that's not really proper, you know, these days.
So, we do something a little bit more serious.
And that's what you see in the last Rose Bowl, you know,
when we entered one of the floats.
That's more on the play side. And on the right side,
that's the Rover just before we finished its testing
to take it to the Cape to launch it.
These are the Rovers up here that you have on Mars now.
So that kind of tells you about, kind of, the fun things,
you know, and the serious things that we try to do.
But I said I'm going to show you a short clip
of one of our employees to kind of give you an idea
about some of the talent that we have.
an instrumental rock band.
It branches on more the experimental side.
There's the improvisational side of jazz.
There's the heavy-hitting sound of rock.
Being able to treat sound as an instrument, and be able to dig
for more abstract sounds and things to play live,
mixing electronics and acoustics.
The music's half of me, but the other half --
I landed probably the best gig of all.
I work for the Jet Propulsion Lab. I'm building the next Mars Rover.
Some of the most brilliant engineers I know
are the ones who have that sort of artistic quality about them.
You've got to do what you want to do.
And anyone who tells you you can't, you don't listen to them.
Maybe they're right - I doubt it.
Tell them where to put it, and then just do what you want to do.
I'm Morgan Hendry. I am NASA.
always people ask, why do we explore?
Why are we doing all of these missions and why are we exploring them?
Well, the way I think about it is fairly simple.
Somehow, 13 billion years ago there was a Big Bang, and you've heard
a little bit about, you know, the origin of the universe.
But somehow what strikes everybody's imagination --
or lots of people's imagination -- somehow from that original Big Bang
we have this beautiful world that we live in today.
all that life that you see around you,
and here we have intelligent people like you and I
who are having a conversation here.
All that started from that Big Bang. So, the question is:
How did that happen? How did that evolve? How did the universe form?
How did the galaxies form? How did the planets form?
Why is there a planet on which there is life which have evolved?
Is that very common?
Is there life on every planet that you can see around the stars?
So we literally are all made out of stardust.
We started from those stars; we are made of stardust.
So, next time you are really depressed, look in the mirror
and you can look and say, hi, I'm looking at a star here.
You can skip the dust part.
But literally, we are all made of stardust.
write the book of how things have came about as they are today.
And one of the first, or the easiest, places we can go
and explore that is to go towards Mars.
And the reason Mars takes particular attention:
it's not very far from us.
You know, it'll take us only six months to get there.
Six to nine months at the right time of the year.
It's a planet somewhat similar to Earth. It's a little bit smaller,
but the land mass on Mars is about the same
as the land mass on Earth, you know,
if you don't take the oceans into account.
It has polar caps. It has an atmosphere somewhat thinner than ours,
so it has weather. So, it's very similar to some extent,
and you can see some of the features on it,
like the Grand Canyon on Mars,
or what we call the Grand Canyon on Mars.
It is like the Grand Canyon on Earth, except a hell of a lot larger.
It has volcanoes on it. And that's Mount Olympus on Mars,
which is a kind of huge volcanic shield on that planet.
And if you look at the height of it
and you compare it to Mount Everest, you see, it'll give you
an idea of how large that Mount Olympus, you know, is,
relative to Mount Everest.
So, it basically dwarfs, you know, Mount Everest here on Earth.
So, that gives you an idea of the tectonic events or volcanic events
which have happened on that planet.
Recently from one of our satellites, this shows that it's Earth-like --
we caught a landslide occurring as it was happening.
So it is a dynamic planet,
and activity is going on as we speak today.
so I thought I would show you a little bit what they are doing.
This is one very large crater. Geologists love craters,
because craters are like digging a big hole in the ground
without really working at it,
and you can see what's below the surface.
So, this is called Victoria Crater,
which is about a few football fields in size.
And if you look at the top left, you see a little teeny dark dot.
This picture was taken from an orbiting satellite.
If I zoom on it, you can see: that's the Rover on the surface.
So, that was taken from orbit; we had the camera zoom on the surface,
and we actually saw the Rover on the surface.
And we actually used the combination of the satellite images
and the Rover to actually conduct science,
because we can observe large areas
and then you can get those Rovers to move around
and basically go to a certain location.
that Rover is going down in that crater.
As I told you, geologists love craters.
And the reason is, many of you went to the Grand Canyon,
and you see in the wall of the Grand Canyon, you see these layers.
And what these layers -- that's what the surface used to be
a million years ago, 10 million years ago,
100 million years ago, and you get deposits on top of them.
So if you can read the layers it's like reading your book,
and you can learn the history of what happened in the past
in that location.
of that crater, and the Rover is going down now, measuring, you know,
the properties and analyzing the rocks
as it's going down, you know, that canyon.
Now, it's kind of a little bit of a challenge driving
down a slope like this.
If you were there you wouldn't do it yourself.
But we really made sure we tested those Rovers
before we got them down -- or that Rover --
and made sure that it's all working well.
I think it was, like, a hundred days after the landing --
I told you I was surprised that those Rovers
are lasting even a hundred days.
Well, here we are four years later, and they're still working.
Now you say, Charles, you are really lying to us, and so on,
but that's not true. We really believed they were going to last
90 days or 100 days, because they are solar powered,
and Mars is a dusty planet, so we expected the dust
would start accumulating on the surface, and after a while
we wouldn't have enough power, you know, to keep them warm.
but every once in a while it's good to be lucky.
And that's what we found out. It turned out that every once in a while
there are dust devils which come by on Mars, as you are seeing here,
and when the dust devil comes over the Rover, it just cleans it up.
It is like a brand new car that you have,
and that's literally why they have lasted so long.
And now we designed them reasonably well,
but that's exactly why they are lasting that long
and still providing all the science data.
Now, the two Rovers, each one of them is, kind of, getting old.
You know, one of them, one of the wheels is stuck, is not working,
one of the front wheels, so what we are doing,
we are driving it backwards.
And the other one has arthritis of the shoulder joint, you know,
it's not working very well, so it's walking like this,
and we can move the arm, you know, that way.
But still they are producing a lot of scientific data.
Now, during that whole period, a number of people got excited,
you know, outside the science community about these Rovers,
so I thought I'd show you a video just to give you a reflection
about how these Rovers are being viewed by people
other than the science community.
By the way, this video is pretty accurate of how the landing took place, you know,
about four years ago.
Video: Okay, we have parachute aligned.
Okay, deploy the airbags. Open.
Camera. We have a picture right now.
Yeah!
CE: That's about what happened in the Houston operation room. It's exactly like this.
Video: Now, if there is life, the Dutch will find it.
What is he doing?
What is that?
CE: Not too bad.
about the beauty of that planet.
As I said earlier, it looked very much like Earth,
so you see sand dunes.
It looks like I could have told you these are pictures taken
from the Sahara Desert or somewhere, and you'd have believed me,
but these are pictures taken from Mars.
But one area which is particularly intriguing for us
is the northern region, you know, of Mars, close to the North Pole,
because we see ice caps, and we see the ice caps shrinking
and expanding, so it's very much like you have in northern Canada.
And we wanted to find out -- and we see all kinds of glacial features on it.
So, we wanted to find out, actually,
what is that ice made of, and could that have embedded in it
some organic, you know, material.
called Phoenix, and that spacecraft will land
17 days, seven hours and 20 seconds from now,
so you can adjust your watch.
So it's on May 25 around just before five o'clock our time here
on the West Coast, actually we will be landing on another planet.
And as you can see, this is a picture of the spacecraft put on Mars,
but I thought that just in case you're going to miss that show, you know,
in 17 days, I'll show you, kind of,
a little bit of what's going to happen.
So the plan is to dig in the soil and take samples
that we put them in an oven and actually heat them
and look what gases will come from it.
So this was launched about nine months ago.
We'll be coming in at 12,000 miles per hour, and in seven minutes
we have to stop and touch the surface very softly
so we don't break that lander.
It's the first mission that's going to try to land
near the North Pole of Mars, and it's the first mission
that's actually going to try and reach out and touch water
on the surface of another planet.
there tends to be life, and so it's potentially a place
where life could have existed on the planet in the past.
at 12,500 miles an hour and bring it to a screeching halt
in a soft way in a very short amount of time.
BC: We enter the Martian atmosphere.
We're 70 miles above the surface of Mars.
And our lander is safely tucked inside what we call an aeroshell.
this saucer-looking thing that has about a half-inch
of essentially what's cork on the front of it,
which is our heat shield.
Now, this is really special cork,
and this cork is what's going to protect us
from the violent atmospheric entry that we're about to experience.
and we use the friction when it's flying through the atmosphere
to our advantage to slow us down.
BC: From this point, we're going to decelerate from 12,500 miles an hour
down to 900 miles an hour.
It probably gets about room temperature.
Richard Kornfeld: There is this window of opportunity
within which we can deploy the parachute.
The fabric and the stitching could just pull apart.
And that would be bad.
we'll decelerate from 900 miles an hour
to a relatively slow 250 miles an hour.
We no longer need the heat shield to protect us
from the force of atmospheric entry, so we jettison the heat shield,
exposing for the first time our lander to the atmosphere of Mars.
the next step is to have the radar system begin to detect
how far Phoenix really is from the ground.
So, we're 99 percent of the way to where we want to be.
But that last one percent, as it always seems to be, is the tricky part.
when it's going to get rid of its parachute.
at roughly a kilometer above the surface of Mars: 3,200 feet.
That's like taking two Empire State Buildings
and stacking them on top of one another.
and we're now in free-fall.
It's a very scary moment; a lot has to happen
in a very short amount of time.
LC: So it's in a free-fall,
but it's also trying to use all of its actuators
to make sure that it's in the right position to land.
and then slowly slow itself down and touch down on the ground safely.
for a signal from Mars to get to Earth.
And EDL itself is all over in a matter of seven minutes.
So by the time you even hear from the lander that EDL has started
it'll already be over.
so that it can land itself safely.
It's about getting a spacecraft that's hurtling through deep space
and using all this bag of tricks to somehow figure out
how to get it down to the surface of Mars at zero miles an hour.
It's this immensely exciting and challenging problem.
So it will be a very tense moment, you know,
as we are watching that spacecraft landing on another planet.
So we are in the process, as we speak, of actually designing
the next Rover that we are going to be sending to Mars.
So I thought I would go a little bit and tell you, kind of,
the steps we go through.
It's very similar to what you do when you design your product.
As you saw a little bit earlier,
when we were doing the Phoenix one,
we have to take into account the heat that we are going to be facing.
So we have to study all kinds of different materials,
the shape that we want to do.
In general we don't try to please the customer here.
What we want to do is to make sure we have an effective, you know,
an efficient kind of machine.
to be as imaginative as they can.
And we really love being close to the art center, because we have,
as a matter of fact, one of the alumni from the art center,
Eric Nyquist, had put a series of displays,
far-out displays, you know,
in our what we call mission design or spacecraft design room,
just to get people to think wildly about things.
We have a bunch of Legos. So, as I said,
this is a playground for adults, where they sit down and try to play
with different shapes and different designs.
what we call our CAD/CAMs and all the engineers who are involved,
or scientists who are involved, who know about thermal properties,
know about design, know about atmospheric interaction, parachutes,
all of these things, which they work in a team effort
and actually design a spacecraft in a computer to some extent,
so to see, does that meet the requirement that we need.
On the right, also, we have to take into account
the environment of the planet where we are going.
If you are going to Jupiter, you have a very high-radiation,
you know, environment. It's about the same radiation environment
close by Jupiter as inside a nuclear reactor.
and it still has to work.
So these are kind of some of the little challenges, you know,
that we have to face.
If we are doing entry, we have to do tests of parachutes.
You saw in the video a parachute breaking. That would be a bad day,
you know, if that happened, so we have to test,
because we are deploying this parachute at supersonic speeds.
We are coming at extremely high speeds, and we are deploying them
to slow us down. So we have to do all kinds of tests.
To give you an idea of the size, you know, of that parachute
relative to the people standing there.
and actually test them, you know, in the lab at JPL,
in what we call our Mars Yard.
We kick them, we hit them, we drop them,
just to make sure we understand how, where would they break.
And then we back off, you know, from that point.
And then we actually do the actual building and the flight.
And this next Rover that we're flying is about the size of a car.
That big shield that you see outside,
that's a heat shield which is going to protect it.
And that will be basically built over the next year,
and it will be launched June a year from now.
Now, in that case, because it was a very big Rover,
we couldn't use airbags.
And I know many of you, kind of, last time afterwards said
well, that was a cool thing to have -- those airbags.
Unfortunately this Rover is, like, ten times the size of the, you know,
mass-wise, of the other Rover, or three times the mass.
So we can't use airbags. So we have to come up with
another ingenious idea of how do we land it.
And we didn't want to take it propulsively all the way to the surface
because we didn't want to contaminate the surface;
we wanted the Rover to immediately land on its legs.
which is used here on Earth for helicopters.
Actually, the lander will come down to about 100 feet and hover
above that surface for 100 feet, and then we have a sky crane
which will take that Rover and land it down on the surface.
Hopefully it all will work, you know, it will work that way.
And that Rover will be more kind of like a chemist.
What we are going to be doing with that Rover as it drives around,
it's going to go and analyze the chemical composition of rocks.
So it will have an arm which will take samples,
put them in an oven, crush and analyze them.
But also, if there is something that we cannot reach
because it is too high on a cliff, we have a little laser system
which will actually zap the rock, evaporate some of it,
and actually analyze what's coming from that rock.
So it's a little bit like "Star Wars," you know, but it's real.
It's real stuff.
And also to help you, to help the community
so you can do ads on that Rover, we are going to train that Rover
to actually in addition to do this, to actually serve cocktails,
you know, also on Mars.
fun things we are doing on Mars.
I thought I'd go to "The Lord of the Rings" now
and show you some of the things we have there.
Now, "The Lord of the Rings" has two things played through it.
One, it's a very attractive planet --
it just has the beauty of the rings and so on.
But for scientists, also the rings have a special meaning,
because we believe they represent, on a small scale,
how the Solar System actually formed.
Some of the scientists believe that the way the Solar System formed,
that the Sun when it collapsed and actually created the Sun,
a lot of the dust around it created rings
and then the particles in those rings accumulated together,
and they formed bigger rocks, and then that's how the planets,
you know, were formed.
our solar system in real time being formed on a smaller scale,
so it's like a test bed for it.
So, let me show you a little bit
on what that Saturnian system looks like.
First, I'm going to fly you over the rings.
By the way, all of this is real stuff.
This is not animation or anything like this.
This is actually taken from the satellite
that we have in orbit around Saturn, the Cassini.
And you see the amount of detail that is in those rings,
which are the particles.
Some of them are agglomerating together to form larger particles.
So that's why you have these gaps, is because a small satellite, you know,
is being formed in that location.
Now, you think that those rings are very large objects.
Yes, they are very large in one dimension;
in the other dimension they are paper thin. Very, very thin.
What you are seeing here is the shadow of the ring on Saturn itself.
And that's one of the satellites
which was actually formed on that one.
So, think about it as a paper-thin,
huge area of many hundreds of thousands of miles, which is rotating.
each one looking very different and very odd, and that keeps
scientists busy for tens of years trying to explain this,
and telling NASA we need more money so we can explain
what these things look like, or why they formed that way.
Well, there were two satellites which were particularly interesting.
One of them is called Enceladus.
It's a satellite which was all made of ice,
and we measured it from orbit. Made of ice.
But there was something bizarre about it.
If you look at these stripes in here, what we call tiger stripes,
when we flew over them, all of a sudden we saw
an increase in the temperature, which said that those stripes
are warmer than the rest of the planet.
We saw geysers coming out.
So this is a Yellowstone, you know, of Saturn.
We are seeing geysers of ice which are coming out of that planet,
which indicate that most likely there is an ocean, you know,
below the surface.
And somehow, through some dynamic effect, we're having these geysers
which are being, you know, emitted from it.
And the reason I showed the little arrow there,
I think that should say 30 miles,
we decided a few months ago to actually fly the spacecraft
through the plume of that geyser
so we can actually measure the material that it is made of.
That was [unclear] also -- you know, because we were worried
about the risk of it, but it worked pretty well.
We flew at the top of it, and we found that there is a fair amount of
organic material which is being emitted in combination with the ice.
And over the next few years, as we keep orbiting, you know, Saturn,
we are planning to get closer and closer down to the surface
and make more accurate measurements.
and that's Titan. And the reason Titan is particularly interesting,
it's a satellite bigger than our moon, and it has an atmosphere.
And that atmosphere is very -- as dense as our own atmosphere.
So if you were on Titan, you would feel the same pressure
that you feel in here. Except it's a lot colder,
and that atmosphere is heavily made of methane.
Now, methane gets people all excited, because it's organic material,
so immediately people start thinking,
could life have evolved in that location,
when you have a lot of organic material.
So people believe now that Titan is most likely what we call
a pre-biotic planet, because it's so cold organic material did not get
to the stage of becoming biological material,
and therefore life could have evolved on it.
before life actually started on it.
So that's getting a lot of interest, and to show you some example
of what we did in there, we actually dropped a probe,
which was developed by our colleagues in Europe, we dropped a probe
as we were orbiting Saturn.
We dropped a probe in the atmosphere of Titan.
And this is a picture of an area as we were coming down.
Just looked like the coast of California for me.
You see the rivers which are coming along the coast,
and you see that white area which looks like Catalina Island,
and that looks like an ocean.
And then with an instrument we have on board, a radar instrument,
we found there are lakes like the Great Lakes in here,
so it looks very much like Earth.
It looks like there are rivers on it, there are oceans or lakes,
we know there are clouds. We think it's raining also on it.
So it's very much like the cycle on Earth except
because it's so cold, it could not be water, you know,
because water would have frozen.
What it turned out, that all that we are seeing, all this liquid,
[is made of] hydrocarbon and ethane and methane,
similar to what you put in your car.
but is all made of ethane and methane and organic material.
So if you were on Mars -- sorry, on Titan,
you don't have to worry about four-dollar gasoline.
You just drive to the nearest lake, stick your hose in it,
and you've got your car filled up.
On the other hand, if you light a match
the whole planet will blow up.
So in closing, I said I want to close by a couple of pictures.
And just to kind of put us in perspective,
this is a picture of Saturn taken with a spacecraft
from behind Saturn, looking towards the Sun.
The Sun is behind Saturn, so we see what we call "forward scattering,"
so it highlights all the rings. And I'm going to zoom.
There is a -- I'm not sure you can see it very well,
but on the top left, around 10 o'clock,
there is a little teeny dot, and that's Earth.
You barely can see ourselves. So what I did, I thought I'd zoom on it.
So as you zoom in, you know, you can see Earth, you know,
just in the middle here. So we zoomed all the way on the art center.
What technology can we really apply to reducing global poverty?
And what I found was quite surprising.
We started looking at things like death rates in the 20th century,
and how they'd been improved, and very simple things turned out.
You'd think maybe antibiotics made more difference than clean water,
but it's actually the opposite.
And so very simple things -- off-the-shelf technologies
that we could easily find on the then-early Web --
would clearly make a huge difference to that problem.
and nanotechnology and genetic engineering and other new emerging
kind of digital technologies, became very concerned
about the potential for abuse.
If you think about it, in history, a long, long time ago
we dealt with the problem of an individual abusing another individual.
We came up with something -- the Ten Commandments: Thou shalt not kill.
That's a, kind of a one-on-one thing.
We organized into cities. We had many people.
And to keep the many from tyrannizing the one,
we came up with concepts like individual liberty.
And then, to have to deal with large groups,
say, at the nation-state level,
and we had to have mutual non-aggression,
or through a series of conflicts, we eventually came to
a rough international bargain to largely keep the peace.
an asymmetric situation, where technology is so powerful
that it extends beyond a nation-state.
It's not the nation-states that have potential access
to mass destruction, but individuals.
And this is a consequence of the fact that these new technologies tend to be digital.
We saw genome sequences.
You can download the gene sequences
of pathogens off the Internet if you want to,
and clearly someone recently -- I saw in a science magazine --
they said, well, the 1918 flu is too dangerous to FedEx around.
If people want to use it in their labs for working on research,
just reconstruct it yourself,
because, you know, it might break in FedEx.
So that this is possible to do this is not deniable.
kinds of self-replicating technologies, whether it be biological
or other, are clearly a danger in our world.
And the danger is that they can cause roughly what's a pandemic.
And we really don't have experience with pandemics,
and we're also not very good as a society at acting
to things we don't have direct and sort of gut-level experience with.
So it's not in our nature to pre-act.
And in this case, piling on more technology doesn't solve the problem,
because it only super-empowers people more.
and others imagine in a conversation that existed
in a much stronger form, I think, early in the 20th century,
that the solution had to be not just the head but the heart.
You know, public policy and moral progress.
The bargain that gives us civilization is a bargain to not use power.
We get our individual rights by society protecting us from others
not doing everything they can do but largely doing only what is legal.
And so to limit the danger of these new things, we have to limit,
ultimately, the ability of individuals
to have access, essentially, to pandemic power.
We also have to have sensible defense, because no limitation
is going to prevent a crazy person from doing something.
And you know, and the troubling thing is that
it's much easier to do something bad than to defend
against all possible bad things,
so the offensive uses really have an asymmetric advantage.
and my friends told me I was getting really depressed,
and they were really worried about me.
And then I signed a book contract to write more gloomy thoughts about this
and moved into a hotel room in New York
with one room full of books on the Plague,
and you know, nuclear bombs exploding in New York
where I would be within the circle, and so on.
And then I was there on September 11th,
and I stood in the streets with everyone.
And it was quite an experience to be there.
I got up the next morning and walked out of the city,
and all the sanitation trucks were parked on Houston Street
and ready to go down and start taking the rubble away.
And I walked down the middle, up to the train station,
and everything below 14th Street was closed.
It was quite a compelling experience, but not really, I suppose,
a surprise to someone who'd had his room full of the books.
It was always a surprise that it happened then and there,
but it wasn't a surprise that it happened at all.
Thousands of people started writing about this.
And I eventually abandoned the book, and then Chris called me
to talk at the conference. I really don't talk about this anymore
because, you know, there's enough frustrating and depressing things going on.
But I agreed to come and say a few things about this.
And I would say that we can't give up the rule of law
to fight an asymmetric threat, which is what we seem to be doing
because of the present, the people that are in power,
because that's to give up the thing that makes civilization.
And we can't fight the threat in the kind of stupid way we're doing,
because a million-dollar act
causes a billion dollars of damage, causes a trillion dollar response
which is largely ineffective and arguably, probably almost certainly,
has made the problem worse.
So we can't fight the thing with a million-to-one cost,
one-to-a-million cost-benefit ratio.
to be able to join Kleiner Perkins about a year ago,
and to work through venture capital on the innovative side,
and to try to find some innovations that could address what I saw as
some of these big problems.
Things where, you know, a factor of 10 difference
can make a factor of 1,000 difference in the outcome.
I've been amazed in the last year at the incredible quality
and excitement of the innovations that have come across my desk.
It's overwhelming at times. I'm very thankful for Google and Wikipedia
so I can understand at least a little of what people are talking about
who come through the doors.
that I'm particularly excited about and that relate to the problems
that I was talking about in the Wired article.
The first is this whole area of education,
and it really relates to what Nicholas was talking about with a $100 computer.
And that is to say that there's a lot of legs left in Moore's Law.
The most advanced transistors today are at 65 nanometers,
and we've seen, and I've had the pleasure to invest
in, companies that give me great confidence that we'll extend Moore's Law
all the way down to roughly the 10 nanometer scale.
Another factor of, say, six in dimensional reduction,
which should give us about another factor of 100 in raw improvement
in what the chips can do. And so, to put that in practical terms,
if something costs about 1,000 dollars today,
say, the best personal computer you can buy, that might be its cost,
I think we can have that in 2020 for 10 dollars. Okay?
Now, just imagine what that $100 computer will be in 2020
as a tool for education.
I'm very certain that that will happen, the challenge is,
will we develop the kind of educational tools and things with the net
to let us take advantage of that device?
I'd argue today that we have incredibly powerful computers,
but we don't have very good software for them.
And it's only in retrospect, after the better software comes along,
and you take it and you run it on a ten-year-old machine, you say,
God, the machine was that fast?
I remember when they took the Apple Mac interface
and they put it back on the Apple II.
The Apple II was perfectly capable of running that kind of interface,
we just didn't know how to do it at the time.
So given that we know and should believe --
because Moore's Law's been, like, a constant,
I mean, it's just been very predictable progress
over the last 40 years or whatever.
We can know what the computers are going to be like in 2020.
It's great that we have initiatives to say,
let's go create the education and educate people in the world,
because that's a great force for peace.
And we can give everyone in the world a $100 computer
or a $10 computer in the next 15 years.
because that's clearly going to put a lot of pressure on this world.
We'll hear a lot more about that from Al Gore very shortly.
The thing that we see as the kind of Moore's Law trend
that's driving improvement in our ability to address
the environmental problem is new materials.
We have a challenge, because the urban population is growing
in this century from two billion to six billion
in a very short amount of time. People are moving to the cities.
They all need clean water, they need energy, they need transportation,
and we want them to develop in a green way.
We're reasonably efficient in the industrial sectors.
We've made improvements in energy and resource efficiency,
but the consumer sector, especially in America, is very inefficient.
But these new materials bring such incredible innovations
that there's a strong basis for hope that these things
will be so profitable that they can be brought to the market.
that was discovered 15 years ago.
If we take carbon nanotubes, you know, Iijima discovered them in 1991,
they just have incredible properties.
And these are the kinds of things we're going to discover
as we start to engineer at the nano scale.
Their strength: they're almost the strongest material,
they have all sorts of incredible properties.
If you shoot a particle at them and knock a hole in them,
they repair themselves; they go zip and they repair the hole
in femtoseconds, which is not -- is really quick.
(Laughter)
If you shine a light on them, they produce electricity.
In fact, if you flash them with a camera they catch on fire.
If you put electricity on them, they emit light.
If you run current through them, you can run 1,000 times more current
through one of these than through a piece of metal.
You can make both p- and n-type semiconductors,
which means you can make transistors out of them.
They conduct heat along their length but not across --
well, there is no width, but not in the other direction
if you stack them up; that's a property of carbon fiber also.
If you put particles in them, and they go shooting out the tip --
they're like miniature linear accelerators or electron guns.
The inside of the nanotubes is so small --
the smallest ones are 0.7 nanometers --
that it's basically a quantum world.
It's a strange place inside a nanotube.
where the kind of things Lisa Randall's talking about are in there.
I had one business plan where I was trying to learn more about
Witten's cosmic dimension strings to try to understand
what the phenomenon was going on in this proposed nanomaterial.
So inside of a nanotube, we're really at the limit here.
So what we see is with these and other new materials
that we can do things with different properties -- lighter, stronger --
and apply these new materials to the environmental problems.
New materials that can make water,
new materials that can make fuel cells work better,
new materials that catalyze chemical reactions,
that cut pollution and so on.
Ethanol -- new ways of making ethanol.
New ways of making electric transportation.
The whole green dream -- because it can be profitable.
And we've dedicated -- we've just raised a new fund,
we dedicated 100 million dollars to these kinds of investments.
We believe that Genentech, the Compaq, the Lotus, the Sun,
the Netscape, the Amazon, the Google in these fields
are yet to be found, because this materials revolution
and we just announced last week -- we were all in New York.
We raised 200 million dollars in a specialty fund
to work on a pandemic in biodefense.
And to give you an idea of the last fund that Kleiner raised
was a $400 million fund, so this for us is a very substantial fund.
And what we did, over the last few months -- well, a few months ago,
Ray Kurzweil and I wrote an op-ed in the New York Times
about how publishing the 1918 genome was very dangerous.
And John Doerr and Brook and others got concerned, [unclear],
and we started looking around at what the world was doing
about being prepared for a pandemic. And we saw a lot of gaps.
that will go fill these gaps? And Brooks told me in a break here,
he said he's found so much stuff he can't sleep,
because there's so many great technologies out there,
we're essentially buried. And we need them, you know.
We have one antiviral that people are talking about stockpiling
that still works, roughly. That's Tamiflu.
But Tamiflu -- the virus is resistant. It is resistant to Tamiflu.
We've discovered with AIDS we need cocktails to work well
so that the viral resistance -- we need several anti-virals.
We need better surveillance.
We need networks that can find out what's going on.
We need rapid diagnostics so that we can tell if somebody has
a strain of flu which we have only identified very recently.
We've got to be able to make the rapid diagnostics quickly.
We need new anti-virals and cocktails. We need new kinds of vaccines.
Vaccines that are broad spectrum.
Vaccines that we can manufacture quickly.
Cocktails, more polyvalent vaccines.
You normally get a trivalent vaccine against three possible strains.
We need -- we don't know where this thing is going.
We believe that if we could fill these 10 gaps,
we have a chance to help really reduce the risk of a pandemic.
And the difference between a normal flu season and a pandemic
is about a factor of 1,000 in deaths
or speed up 10 projects and see them come to market
in the next couple years that will address this.
help address the environment, help address the pandemic,
does that solve the larger problem that I was talking about
in the Wired article? And I'm afraid the answer is really no,
because you can't solve a problem with the management of technology
with more technology.
If we let an unlimited amount of power loose, then we will --
a very small number of people will be able to abuse it.
We can't fight at a million-to-one disadvantage.
So what we need to do is, we need better policy.
And for example, some things we could do
that would be policy solutions which are not really in the political air right now
but perhaps with the change of administration would be -- use markets.
For example, rather than trying to regulate away problems,
which probably won't work, if we could price
into the cost of doing business, the cost of catastrophe,
so that people who are doing things that had a higher cost of catastrophe
would have to take insurance against that risk.
And if you apply the notion of insurance more broadly,
How could you keep the law?
I think the law would be a really good thing to keep.
don't have any personal responsibility
So if you tie that -- you have to tie that back with the law.
we have to begin to design the future.
We can't pick the future, but we can steer the future.
Our investment in trying to prevent pandemic flu
is affecting the distribution of possible outcomes.
We may not be able to stop it, but the likelihood
that it will get past us is lower if we focus on that problem.
the people on the defensive side,
have an advantage over the people who want to abuse things.
And what we have to do to do that
is we have to limit access to certain information.
and who are still fighting this battle against the church.
But that's the price of having a civilization.
The price of retaining the rule of law
is to limit the access to the great and kind of unbridled power.
Thank you.
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,
make education seem like a bright idea.
(Laughter)
or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.
Great creativity can make politicians electable,
or parties unelectable.
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.
and phrases on our lips.
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road
through an impenetrable moral maze.
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,
more magical. And now we need that magic.
This is a time of need.
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.
To tempt us to act differently
with delightful creative scraps.
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in
using creativity to inspire people to be greener.
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields
and broken his heart.
Sure, she had aged a little.
In fact, she had aged a lot.
But he felt all his old passion for her return.
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,
for that was his name.
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.
Let's go there and make love. In the tent."
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically
while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.
The earth moved for both of them.
And they lived together happily ever after.
And all because he decided to walk that day.
(Applause)
The moral imperative is on the table.
Great creativity is needed to take it all,
make it simple and sharp.
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.
So this is a call, a plea,
to the incredibly talented TED community.
Let's get creative against climate change.
And let's do it soon. Thank you.
(Applause)
My name is Ursus Wehrli, and I would like to talk to you this morning
about my project, Tidying Up Art.
First of all -- any questions so far?
First of all, I have to say I'm not from around here.
I'm from a completely different cultural area, maybe you noticed?
I mean, I'm wearing a tie, first. And then secondly, I'm a little bit nervous
because I'm speaking in a foreign language,
and I want to apologize in advance, for any mistakes I might make.
Because I'm from Switzerland, and I just don't hope you think this is Swiss German
I'm speaking now here. This is just what it sounds like
if we Swiss try to speak American.
But don't worry -- I don't have trouble with English, as such.
I mean, it's not my problem, it's your language after all.
(Laughter)
I am fine. After this presentation here at TED, I can simply go back to Switzerland,
and you have to go on talking like this all the time.
(Laughter)
It's called "Tidying Up Art" and it's, as you can see,
it's more or less a picture book.
So the reading would be over very quickly.
But since I'm here at TED, I decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way,
in the spirit of TED here, and I managed to do some slides here for you.
I'd like to show them around so we can just, you know --
(Laughter)
Actually, I managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better.
You won't be familiar with it.
I mean, it's a hobby of mine that I've been indulging in for the last few years,
and it all started out with this picture of the American artist, Donald Baechler
I had hanging at home. I had to look at it every day
and after a while I just couldn't stand the mess anymore
this guy was looking at all day long.
Yeah, I kind of felt sorry for him.
And it seemed to me even he felt really bad
facing these unorganized red squares day after day.
So I decided to give him a little support,
and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other.
(Laughter)
Yeah. And I think he looks now less miserable.
And it was great. With this experience, I started to look more closely
at modern art. Then I realized how, you know, the world of modern art
is particularly topsy-turvy.
It's actually a simple one, but it's a good one to start with.
It's a picture by Paul Klee.
And we can see here very clearly, it's a confusion of color.
(Laughter)
Yeah. The artist doesn't really seem to know where to put the different colors.
The various pictures here of the various elements of the picture --
the whole thing is unstructured.
We don't know, maybe Mr. Klee was probably in a hurry, I mean --
(Laughter)
-- maybe he had to catch a plane, or something.
We can see here he started out with orange,
and then he already ran out of orange,
and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square.
And I would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture.
(Laughter)
We can see now what was barely recognizable in the original:
17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares.
Yeah, that's great.
So I mean, that's just tidying up for beginners.
I would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced.
(Laughter)
I mean, you see, everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space.
If my room back home had looked like this,
my mother would have grounded me for three days.
So I'd like to -- I wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture.
And that's really advanced tidying up.
(Applause)
Yeah, you're right. Sometimes people clap at this point,
but that's actually more in Switzerland.
(Laughter)
We Swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese. Our trains run on time.
We are only happy when things are in order.
This is a picture by Joan Miro.
And yeah, we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes
and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background.
And yeah, it's the sort of thing you produce when you're doodling on the phone.
(Laughter)
And this is my --
(Laughter)
-- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space.
It's more economical and also more efficient.
With this method Mr. Miro could have saved canvas for another picture.
So that you can just appreciate how serious I am about all this,
I brought along the patents, the specifications for some of these works,
because I've had my working methods patented
at the Eidgenössische Amt für Geistiges Eigentum in Bern, Switzerland.
(Laughter)
I'll just quote from the specification.
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht --"
It's not finished yet.
"Laut den Kunstprüfer Dr. Albrecht Götz von Ohlenhusen
wird die Verfahrensweise rechtlich geschützt welche die Kunst
durch spezifisch aufgeräumte Regelmässigkeiten
des allgemeinen Formenschatzes
neue Wirkungen zu erzielen möglich wird."
I'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway.
I just realized it's important how one introduces new ideas to people,
that's why these patents are sometimes necessary.
I would like to do a short test with you.
Everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning.
So I would like to ask you all to raise your right hand. Yeah.
The right hand is the one we write with, apart from the left-handers.
And now, I'll count to three. I mean, it still looks very orderly to me.
Now, I'll count to three, and on the count of three
I'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you. OK?
One, two, three.
(Laughter)
can sometimes lead to complete chaos.
So we can also see that very clearly in this next painting.
This is a painting by the artist, Niki de Saint Phalle.
And I mean, in the original it's completely unclear to see
what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict.
But in the tidied up version, it's plain to see that it's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball.
(Laughter)
Yeah, it's a -- this one here, that's much better.
That's a picture by Keith Haring.
(Laughter)
I think it doesn't matter.
So, I mean, this picture has not even got a proper title.
It's called "Untitled" and I think that's appropriate.
(Laughter)
This is Keith Haring looked at statistically.
One can see here quite clearly,
you can see we have 25 pale green elements,
of which one is in the form of a circle.
Or here, for example, we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve.
I mean, that's interesting. One could extend this sort of statistical analysis
to cover all Mr. Haring's various works,
in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares.
And the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure
by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he's likely to need in the future.
(Laughter)
For example, with the Keith Haring circles and Kandinsky's dots.
You can add them to all the squares of Paul Klee.
In the end, one has a list with which one then can arrange.
Then you categorize it, then you file it, put that file in a filing cabinet,
put it in your office and you can make a living doing it.
(Laughter)
Yeah, from my own experience. So I'm --
(Laughter)
Actually, I mean, here we have some artists that are a bit more structured. It's not too bad.
This is Jasper Johns. We can see here he was practicing with his ruler.
(Laughter)
And I think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this.
(Laughter)
And here, that's one of my favorites.
Tidying up Rene Magritte -- this is really fun.
You know, there is a --
(Laughter)
I'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this.
It goes back to a time when I was very often staying in hotels.
So once I had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy, five-star hotel.
And you know, there you had this little sign --
I put this little sign outside the door every morning that read,
"Please tidy room." I don't know if you have them over here.
So actually, my room there hasn't been tidied once daily, but three times a day.
So after a while I decided to have a little fun,
and before leaving the room each day I'd scatter a few things around the space.
Like books, clothes, toothbrush, etc. And it was great.
By the time I returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place.
But then one morning, I hang the same little sign onto that picture by Vincent van Gogh.
(Laughter)
And you have to say this room hadn't been tidied up since 1888.
And when I returned it looked like this.
(Laughter)
Yeah, at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming.
(Laughter)
that like reacting that one or another picture
hasn't been properly tidied up. So we can make a short test with you.
This is a picture by Rene Magritte,
and I'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head, that is --
to tidy that up. So it's possible that some of you would make it like this.
(Laughter)
Yeah? I would actually prefer to do it more this way.
Some people would make apple pie out of it.
But it's a very good example to see that the whole work
was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job
of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements.
And it's not done, as many people imagine, with the computer,
otherwise it would look like this.
(Laughter)
Here is a very good example. Take Jackson Pollock, for example.
It's -- oh, no, it's -- that's a really hard one.
But after a while, I just decided here to go all the way
and put the paint back into the cans.
(Applause)
Or you could go into three-dimensional art.
Here we have the fur cup by Meret Oppenheim.
Here I just brought it back to its original state.
(Laughter)
But yeah, and it's great, you can even go, you know --
Or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art.
The pointillist movement is that kind of paintings
where everything is broken down into dots and pixels.
And then I -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up.
(Laughter)
and I collected together all his dots.
And now they're all in here.
(Laughter)
You can count them afterwards, if you like.
You see, that's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea:
it's new. So there is no existing tradition in it.
There is no textbooks, I mean, not yet, anyway.
I mean, it's "the future we will create."
(Laughter)
But to round things up I would like to show you just one more.
This is the village square by Pieter Bruegel.
That's how it looks like when you send everyone home.
(Laughter)
Yeah, maybe you're asking yourselves
where old Bruegel's people went?
Of course, they're not gone. They're all here.
(Laughter)
I just piled them up.
(Laughter)
And for those who want to see more, I've got my book downstairs in the bookshop.
And I'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist.
(Laughter)
But before leaving I would like to show you,
I'm working right now on another -- in a related field
with my tidying up art method. I'm working in a related field.
And I started to bring some order into some flags.
Here -- that's just my new proposal here for the Union Jack.
(Laughter)
And then maybe before I leave you ...
yeah, I think, after you have seen that I have to leave anyway.
(Laughter)
Yeah, that was a hard one. I couldn't find a way to tidy that up properly,
so I just decided to make it a little bit more simpler.
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
(Applause)

This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high.

that my disability has not been a serious handicap.
Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people
to pursue the quest for knowledge.
and we are making good progress.
This answer took seven minutes, and really gave me an insight
into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED.
Professor, we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made
to share your questions with us today.
I spent the better part of a decade
And I'd like to start by sharing with you one moment
that to me sums up what there is to know
about American and democratic responses to mass atrocity.
So 14 years ago, almost, in the middle of the Rwandan genocide,
in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated
by the Rwandan government and some extremist militia.
On April 21, in the New York Times,
had already been killed in the genocide.
It was in the paper -- not on the front page.
It was a lot like the Holocaust coverage,
it was buried in the paper.
Rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy,
and amazingly, genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy.
And that was that an American congresswoman
named Patricia Schroeder from Colorado
met with a group of journalists.
And one of the journalists said to her, what's up?
What's going on in the U.S. government?
Two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated
in the last couple of weeks in Rwanda.
It's two weeks into the genocide at that time,
but of course, at that time you don't know how long it's going to last.
And the journalist said, why is there so little response out of Washington?
And she said -- she was so honest -- she said, "It's a great question.
All I can tell you is that in my congressional office in Colorado
and my office in Washington,
we're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls
about the endangered ape and gorilla population in Rwanda,
but nobody is calling about the people.
The phones just aren't ringing about the people."
And that truth is, or was, in the 20th century,
that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements,
we didn't have an endangered people's movement.
We had Holocaust education in the schools.
Most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe,
but also on images and knowledge of the Holocaust.
There's a museum, of course, on the Mall in Washington,
right next to Lincoln and Jefferson.
I mean, we have owned Never Again culturally,
appropriately, interestingly.
And yet the politicization of Never Again,
the operationalization of Never Again,
had never occurred in the 20th century.
that if we are to bring about an end to the world's worst atrocities,
we have to make it such.
There has to be a role --
there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs
in response to massive crimes against humanity, and so forth.
So that was the 20th century.
there is good news, amazing news, in the 21st century,
and one that looks destined, in fact, to be permanent.
It grew up in response to the atrocities in Darfur.
It is comprised of students. There are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters
on college campuses around the country.
It's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement.
There are something like 500 high school chapters
devoted to stopping the genocide in Darfur.
Evangelicals have joined it. Jewish groups have joined it.
"Hotel Rwanda" watchers have joined it. It is a cacophonous movement.
It's diverse. It's got a lot of different approaches.
It's got all the ups and the downs of movements.
But it has been amazingly successful in one regard,
that was missing in the 20th century.
It sees itself, such as it is, the it,
as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost,
there will be a political price to be paid,
for allowing genocide, for not having an heroic imagination,
for not being an upstander but for being, in fact, a bystander.
there's some amazing things that the movement has done.
They have launched a divestment campaign
that has now convinced, I think, 55 universities in 22 states
to divest their holdings of stocks
with regard to companies doing business in Sudan.
They have a 1-800-GENOCIDE number --
this is going to sound very kitsch,
but for those of you who may not be, I mean, may be apolitical,
but interested in doing something about genocide,
you dial 1-800-GENOCIDE and you type in your zip code,
and you don't even have to know who your congressperson is.
It will refer you directly to your congressperson, to your U.S. senator,
to your governor where divestment legislation is pending.
They've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide.
I think the most innovative thing they've introduced recently
are genocide grades.
And it takes students to introduce genocide grades.
So what you now have when a Congress is in session
is members of Congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds
and saying, I'm just told I have a D minus on genocide;
what do I do to get a C? I just want to get a C. Help me.
And the students and the others
who are part of this incredibly energized base
are there to answer that, and there's always something to do.
from the United States,
at a time of massive over-stretch -- military, financial, diplomatic --
a whole series of commitments to Darfur
that no other country in the world is making.
For instance, the referral of the crimes in Darfur
to the International Criminal Court,
which the Bush administration doesn't like.
The expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep,
basically, the people who've been displaced from their homes
by the Sudanese government, by the so-called Janjaweed, the militia,
to keep those people alive
until something more durable can be achieved.
And recently, or now not that recently,
about six months ago, the authorization of a peacekeeping force
of 26,000 that will go.
and it's all because of this bottom-up pressure
and the fact that the phones haven't stopped ringing
from the beginning of this crisis.
The bad news, however, to this question of will evil prevail,
is that evil lives on.
The people in those camps are surrounded on all sides
Women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid
in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid,
the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated, really, to be edible --
are themselves subjected to rape,
which is a tool of the genocide that is being used.
And the peacekeepers I've mentioned, the force has been authorized,
and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding
as we sit here, as we speak.
Why the limits to the movement?
Why is what has been achieved, or what the movement has done,
been necessary but not sufficient to the crime?
I think there are a couple -- there are many reasons --
but a couple just to focus on briefly.
It does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves
are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide.
And the Holocaust culture that we have in this country
makes Americans, sort of, more prone to, I think,
want to bring Never Again to life.
The guilt that the Clinton administration expressed,
that Bill Clinton expressed over Rwanda,
created a space in our society for a consensus
that Rwanda was bad and wrong
and we wish we had done more, and that is something
that the movement has taken advantage of.
European governments, for the most part,
haven't acknowledged responsibility, and there's nothing to kind of
to push back and up against.
will have to cross borders, and you will have to see
other citizens in democracies, not simply resting on the assumption
that their government would do something in the face of genocide,
but actually making it such.
Governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude
naturally or eagerly.
As we saw, they haven't even gravitated towards protecting our ports
or reigning in loose nukes.
Why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself
towards distant suffering?
So one reason is it hasn't gone global.
we have a credibility problem,
a legitimacy problem in international institutions.
It is structurally really, really hard to do,
as the Bush administration rightly does,
which is to denounce genocide on a Monday
and then describe water boarding on a Tuesday as a no-brainer
and then turn up on Wednesday and look for troop commitments.
Now, other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved.
Let me be clear.
They're in some ways using the Bush administration as an alibi.
But it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere,
of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world.
The recovery's going to take some time.
that could come home to roost sometime in the future?
The place that I turned to answer that question was to a man
that many of you may not have ever heard of,
and that is a Brazilian named Sergio Vieira de Mello who,
as Chris said, was blown up in Iraq in 2003.
He was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in Iraq.
It's hard to remember, but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003,
even after the U.S. invasion, where,
apart from looting, civilians were relatively safe in Iraq.
In addition to being Brazilian, he was described to me
before I met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between
James Bond on the one hand and Bobby Kennedy on the other.
And in the U.N., you don't get that many people
who actually manage to merge those qualities.
He was James Bond-like in that he was ingenious.
He was drawn to the flames, he chased the flames,
he was like a moth to the flames. Something of an adrenalin junkie.
He was successful with women.
He was Bobby Kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell
if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist
of troubleshooting in the world's worst places
and in the world's most broken places.
In failing states, genocidal states, under-governed states,
These are the places he was drawn to.
He moved with the headlines.
He was in the U.N. for 34 years. He joined at the age of 21.
Started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s
were wars of independence and decolonization.
He was there in Bangladesh
dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees --
the largest refugee flow in history up to that point.
He was in Sudan when the civil war broke out there.
He was in Cyprus right after the Turkish invasion.
He was in Mozambique for the War of Independence.
Israel then invaded and overran the U.N. base.
by the first-ever suicide attack against the United States.
People date the beginning of this new era to 9/11, but surely 1983,
with the attack on the US Embassy and the Marine barracks --
which Sergio witnessed -- those are, in fact, in some ways,
the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today.
From Lebanon he went to Bosnia in the '90s.
The issues were, of course, ethnic sectarian violence.
He was the first person to negotiate with the Khmer Rouge.
Talk about evil prevailing. I mean, here he was in the room
with the embodiment of evil in Cambodia.
He negotiates with the Serbs.
He actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil
and trying to convince evil that it doesn't need to prevail
that he earns the nickname -- not Sergio but Serbio
while he's living in the Balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations.
and he's the guy who has to decide -- huh, OK, the genocide is over;
800,000 people have been killed; the people responsible are fleeing
into neighboring countries -- into Congo, into Tanzania.
I'm Sergio, I'm a humanitarian, and I want to feed those --
well, I don't want to feed the killers
but I want to feed the two million people who are with them, so we're going to go,
we're going to set up camps,
and we're going to supply humanitarian aid.
But, uh-oh, the killers are within the camps.
Well, I'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves.
Let me go door-to-door to the international community
and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation.
And their response, of course, was no more than we wanted
to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm's way to do that,
nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps.
Do you turn off the international spigot of life support
and risk two million civilian lives?
Or do you continue feeding the civilians, knowing that the genocidaires
are in the camps, literally sharpening their knives for future battle?
What do you do?
It's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places.
He's the guy put in charge. He's the Paul Bremer or the Jerry Bremer
of first Kosovo and then East Timor. He governs the places.
He's the viceroy. He has to decide on tax policy, on currency,
on border patrol, on policing. He has to make all these judgments.
He's a Brazilian in these places. He speaks seven languages.
He's been up to that point in 14 war zones
so he's positioned to make better judgments, perhaps,
than people who have never done that kind of work.
But nonetheless, he is the cutting edge of our experimentation
with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in,
again, the world's worst places.
he's named U.N. Human Rights Commissioner,
and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out,
what do you do when the most powerful country in the United Nations
is bowing out of the Geneva Conventions,
bowing out of international law? Do you denounce?
Well, if you denounce,
you're probably never going to get back in the room.
Maybe you stay reticent. Maybe you try to charm President Bush --
and that's what he did. And in so doing he earned himself,
unfortunately, his final and tragic appointment to Iraq --
the one that resulted in his death.
is that despite predicating the war on Iraq
on a link between Saddam Hussein and terrorism in 9/11,
believe it or not, the Bush administration or the invaders
did no planning, no pre-war planning, to respond to terrorism.
So Sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil
and how to deal with brokenness,
lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue.
Stateless. The guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career.
Like a refugee. Because he represents the U.N.
You're un-owned.
And what the American -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind
was able to muster for his rescue,
believe it or not, was literally these heroic two American soldiers
went into the shaft. Building was shaking.
One of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on September 11th,
and yet went in and risked his life in order to save Sergio.
But all they had was a woman's handbag --
literally one of those basket handbags --
and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at U.N. headquarters,
and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building
in the interests of rescuing this person,
the person we most need to turn to now, this shepherd,
at a time when so many of us feel like we're lacking guidance.
The good news, for what it's worth,
is after Sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the U.N.,
the military created a search and rescue unit
that had the cutting equipment, the shoring wood, the cranes,
the things that you would have needed to do the rescue.
But it was too late for Sergio.
with what I take to be the four lessons from Sergio's life
on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing,
which is how I would have framed the question.
Here's this guy who got a 34-year head start
thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with,
we as citizens are grappling with now. What do we take away?
He, over the course of his career, changed a great deal.
He had a lot of flaws, but he was very adaptive.
I think that was his greatest quality.
He started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers,
he would charge up to people who were violating international law,
and he would say, you're violating, this is the U.N. Charter.
Don't you see it's unacceptable what you're doing?
And they would laugh at him because he didn't have the power of states,
the power of any military or police.
He just had the rules, he had the norms, and he tried to use them.
And in Lebanon, Southern Lebanon in '82,
he said to himself and to everybody else,
I will never use the word "unacceptable" again.
I will never use it. I will try to make it such,
but I will never use that word again.
But he lunged in the opposite direction.
He started, as I mentioned, to get in the room with evil,
to not denounce, and became almost obsequious
when he won the nickname Serbio, for instance,
and even when he negotiated with the Khmer Rouge
would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room.
that we as a country can learn from.
Be in the room, don't be afraid of talking to your adversaries,
but don't bracket what happened before you entered the room.
Don't black-box history. Don't check your principles at the door.
And I think that's something that we have to be in the room,
whether it's Nixon going to China or Khrushchev and Kennedy
or Reagan and Gorbachev.
All the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries
has come by going into the room.
And it doesn't have to be an act of weakness.
You can actually do far more to build an international coalition
against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room
and showing to the rest of the world that that person, that regime,
is the problem and that you, the United States, are not the problem.
What I take away, and this in some ways is the most important,
he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity
that was really, really unusual.
At a micro level, the individuals around him were visible.
He saw them.
At a macro level, he thought, you know,
we talk about democracy promotion, but we do it in a way sometimes
that's an affront to people's dignity.
We put people on humanitarian aid
and we boast about it because we've spent three billion.
It's incredibly important,
those people would no longer be alive if the United States, for instance,
If we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens
and as individuals with relation to the people around us,
and as a country, if we could inject a regard for dignity
into our dealings with other countries,
it would be something of a revolution.
And I recognize there is so much to be afraid of.
There are so many genuine threats in the world.
But what Sergio was talking about is,
let's calibrate our relationship to the threat.
Let's not hype the threat; let's actually see it clearly.
We have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps.
We have reason to be afraid that we haven't secured
loose nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.
Let's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats,
but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic, of a fear.
In times of fear, for instance, one of the things Sergio used to say
is, fear is a bad advisor.
We lunge towards the extremes
had a humility, of course,
and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him.
I mean, such an acute awareness of how hard it was.
How Sisyphean this task was of mending,
and yet aware of that complexity,
humbled by it, he wasn't paralyzed by it.
And we as citizens, as we go through this experience of the kind of,
the crisis of confidence, crisis of competence, crisis of legitimacy,
I think there's a temptation to pull back from the world and say,
ah, Katrina, Iraq -- we don't know what we're doing.
We can't afford to pull back from the world.
It's a question of how to be in the world.
of the anti-genocide movement that I mentioned,
that is a partial success but by no means
has it achieved what it has set out to do --
it'll be many decades, probably, before that happens --
but is that if we want to see change, we have to become the change.
We can't rely upon our institutions to do the work
of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own
without us creating a space for that to happen,
for having respect for dignity,
and for bringing that combination of humility
and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility
to our dealings with the rest of the world.
So will evil prevail? Is that the question?
I think the short answer is: no, not unless we let it.
(Applause)
I love a challenge, and saving the Earth is probably a good one.
We all know the Earth is in trouble.
We have now entered in the 6X,
the sixth major extinction on this planet.
I often wondered, if there was a United Organization of Organisms --
otherwise known as "Uh-Oh" --
(Laughter) -- and every organism had a right to vote,
would we be voted on the planet, or off the planet?
I think that vote is occurring right now.
using fungi, and these solutions are based on mycelium.
The mycelium infuses all landscapes,
it holds soils together, it's extremely tenacious.
This holds up to 30,000 times its mass.
They're the grand molecular disassemblers of nature -- the soil magicians.
They generate the humus soils across the landmasses of Earth.
We have now discovered that there is a multi-directional transfer
of nutrients between plants, mitigated by the mcyelium --
so the mycelium is the mother
that is giving nutrients from alder and birch trees
to hemlocks, cedars and Douglas firs.
I'm in love with the old-growth forest,
and I'm a patriotic American because we have those.
Most of you are familiar with Portobello mushrooms.
And frankly, I face a big obstacle.
When I mention mushrooms to somebody,
they immediately think Portobellos or magic mushrooms,
their eyes glaze over, and they think I'm a little crazy.
So, I hope to pierce that prejudice forever with this group.
We call it mycophobia,
the irrational fear of the unknown, when it comes to fungi.
Day 21, day 23, day 25.
Mushrooms produce strong antibiotics.
In fact, we're more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom.
A group of 20 eukaryotic microbiologists
published a paper two years ago erecting opisthokonta --
a super-kingdom that joins animalia and fungi together.
We share in common the same pathogens.
Fungi don't like to rot from bacteria,
and so our best antibiotics come from fungi.
But here is a mushroom that's past its prime.
After they sporulate, they do rot.
But I propose to you that the sequence of microbes
that occur on rotting mushrooms
are essential for the health of the forest.
They give rise to the trees,
they create the debris fields that feed the mycelium.
And the spores are germinating,
and the mycelium forms and goes underground.
In a single cubic inch of soil, there can be more than eight miles of these cells.
My foot is covering approximately 300 miles of mycelium.
And notice that as the mycelium grows,
it conquers territory and then it begins the net.
I've been a scanning electron microscopist for many years,
I have thousands of electron micrographs,
and when I'm staring at the mycelium,
I realize that they are microfiltration membranes.
We exhale carbon dioxide, so does mycelium.
It inhales oxygen, just like we do.
But these are essentially externalized stomachs and lungs.
And I present to you a concept that these are extended neurological membranes.
And in these cavities, these micro-cavities form,
and as they fuse soils, they absorb water.
These are little wells.
And inside these wells, then microbial communities begin to form.
And so the spongy soil not only resists erosion,
but sets up a microbial universe
that gives rise to a plurality of other organisms.
that mycelium is Earth's natural Internet.
When you look at the mycelium, they're highly branched.
And if there's one branch that is broken, then very quickly,
because of the nodes of crossing --
Internet engineers maybe call them hot points --
there are alternative pathways for channeling nutrients and information.
The mycelium is sentient.
It knows that you are there.
When you walk across landscapes,
it leaps up in the aftermath of your footsteps trying to grab debris.
So, I believe the invention of the computer Internet
is an inevitable consequence
of a previously proven, biologically successful model.
The Earth invented the computer Internet for its own benefit,
and we now, being the top organism on this planet,
are trying to allocate resources in order to protect the biosphere.
I believe matter begets life;
life becomes single cells; single cells become strings;
strings become chains; chains network.
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe.
They came to land 1.3 billion years ago,
and plants followed several hundred million years later.
How is that possible?
It's possible because the mycelium produces oxalic acids,
and many other acids and enzymes,
pockmarking rock and grabbing calcium and other minerals
and forming calcium oxalates.
Makes the rocks crumble, and the first step in the generation of soil.
Oxalic acid is two carbon dioxide molecules joined together.
So, fungi and mycelium
sequester carbon dioxide in the form of calcium oxalates.
And all sorts of other oxalates
are also sequestering carbon dioxide through the minerals
that are being formed and taken out of the rock matrix.
This is a photograph by Franz Hueber.
This photograph's taken 1950s in Saudi Arabia.
420 million years ago, this organism existed.
It was called Prototaxites.
Prototaxites, laying down, was about three feet tall.
The tallest plants on Earth at that time were less than two feet.
Dr. Boyce, at the University of Chicago,
published an article in the Journal of Geology
this past year determining that Prototaxites was a giant fungus,
a giant mushroom.
Across the landscapes of Earth were dotted these giant mushrooms.
All across most land masses.
And these existed for tens of millions of years.
65 million years ago -- most of you know about it --
we had an asteroid impact.
The Earth was struck by an asteroid,
a huge amount of debris was jettisoned into the atmosphere.
Sunlight was cut off, and fungi inherited the Earth.
Those organisms that paired with fungi were rewarded,
because fungi do not need light.
More recently, at Einstein University,
they just determined that fungi use radiation as a source of energy,
much like plants use light.
So, the prospect of fungi existing on other planets elsewhere,
I think, is a forgone conclusion,
at least in my own mind.
I couldn't miss it. It was 2,200 acres in size:
2,200 acres in size, 2,000 years old.
The largest organism on the planet is a mycelial mat, one cell wall thick.
How is it that this organism can be so large,
and yet be one cell wall thick,
whereas we have five or six skin layers that protect us?
The mycelium, in the right conditions, produces a mushroom --
it bursts through with such ferocity that it can break asphalt.
We were involved with several experiments.
I'm going to show you six, if I can,
solutions for helping to save the world.
Battelle Laboratories and I joined up in Bellingham, Washington.
There were four piles saturated with diesel and other petroleum waste:
one was a control pile; one pile was treated with enzymes;
one pile was treated with bacteria;
and our pile we inoculated with mushroom mycelium.
The mycelium absorbs the oil.
The mycelium is producing enzymes --
peroxidases -- that break carbon-hydrogen bonds.
These are the same bonds that hold hydrocarbons together.
So, the mycelium becomes saturated with the oil,
and then, when we returned six weeks later,
all the tarps were removed,
all the other piles were dead, dark and stinky.
We came back to our pile, it was covered
with hundreds of pounds of oyster mushrooms,
and the color changed to a light form.
The enzymes remanufactured the hydrocarbons
into carbohydrates -- fungal sugars.
They're very large.
They're showing how much nutrition that they could've obtained.
But something else happened, which was an epiphany in my life.
They sporulated, the spores attract insects,
the insects laid eggs, eggs became larvae.
Birds then came, bringing in seeds,
and our pile became an oasis of life.
Whereas the other three piles were dead, dark and stinky,
and the PAH's -- the aromatic hydrocarbons --
went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks.
The last image we don't have.
The entire pile was a green berm of life.
These are gateway species,
vanguard species that open the door for other biological communities.
and putting the mycelium -- using storm blown debris,
you can take these burlap sacks and put them downstream
from a farm that's producing E. coli, or other wastes,
or a factory with chemical toxins,
and it leads to habitat restoration.
So, we set up a site in Mason County, Washington,
and we've seen a dramatic decrease in the amount of coliforms.
And I'll show you a graph here.
This is a logarithmic scale, 10 to the eighth power.
There's more than a 100 million colonies per gram,
and 10 to the third power is around 1,000.
In 48 hours to 72 hours, these three mushroom species
reduced the amount of coliform bacteria 10,000 times.
Think of the implications.
This is a space-conservative method that uses storm debris --
and we can guarantee that we will have storms every year.
This is my wife Dusty,
with a mushroom called Fomitopsis officinalis -- Agarikon.
It's a mushroom exclusive to the old-growth forest
that Dioscorides first described in 65 A.D.
as a treatment against consumption.
This mushroom grows in Washington State, Oregon,
northern California, British Columbia, now thought to be extinct in Europe.
May not seem that large --
let's get closer.
This is extremely rare fungus.
Our team -- and we have a team of experts that go out --
we went out 20 times in the old-growth forest last year.
We found one sample to be able to get into culture.
I think is absolutely critical for human health.
I've been involved with the U.S. Defense Department BioShield program.
We submitted over 300 samples of mushrooms that were boiled in hot water,
and mycelium harvesting these extracellular metabolites.
And a few years ago,
we received these results.
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
that were highly active against poxviruses.
Dr. Earl Kern, who's a smallpox expert
of the U.S. Defense Department, states that any compounds
that have a selectivity index of two or more are active.
10 or greater are considered to be very active.
Our mushroom strains were in the highly active range.
There's a vetted press release that you can read --
it's vetted by DOD --
if you Google "Stamets" and "smallpox."
Or you can go to NPR.org and listen to a live interview.
And so, for the first time, I am showing this.
We have three different strains of Agarikon mushrooms
highly active against flu viruses.
Here's the selectivity index numbers --
against pox, you saw 10s and 20s -- now against flu viruses,
compared to the ribavirin controls,
we have an extraordinarily high activity.
And we're using a natural extract
within the same dosage window as a pure pharmaceutical.
We tried it against flu A viruses -- H1N1, H3N2 --
as well as flu B viruses.
So then we tried a blend,
and in a blend combination we tried it against H5N1,
and we got greater than 1,000 selectivity index.
(Applause)
I then think that we can make the argument
that we should save the old-growth forest
as a matter of national defense.
(Applause)
fungi that kill insects.
Our house was being destroyed by carpenter ants.
So, I went to the EPA homepage, and they were recommending studies
with metarhizium species of a group of fungi
that kill carpenter ants, as well as termites.
I did something that nobody else had done.
I actually chased the mycelium, when it stopped producing spores.
These are spores -- this is in their spores.
I was able to morph the culture
into a non-sporulating form.
And so the industry has spent over 100 million dollars
specifically on bait stations to prevent termites from eating your house.
But the insects aren't stupid,
and they would avoid the spores when they came close,
and so I morphed the cultures into a non-sporulating form.
And I got my daughter's Barbie doll dish,
I put it right where a bunch of carpenter ants
were making debris fields, every day,
in my house, and the ants were attracted to the mycelium,
because there's no spores.
They gave it to the queen.
One week later, I had no sawdust piles whatsoever.
the mycelium is consumed by the ants,
they become mummified, and, boing, a mushroom pops out of their head.
(Laughter)
Now after sporulation, the spores repel.
So, the house is no longer suitable for invasion.
So, you have a near-permanent solution for reinvasion of termites.
And so my house came down, I received my first patent
against carpenter ants, termites and fire ants.
Then we tried extracts, and lo and behold,
we can steer insects to different directions.
This has huge implications.
I then received my second patent -- and this is a big one.
It's been called an Alexander Graham Bell patent.
It covers over 200,000 species.
This is the most disruptive technology --
I've been told by executives of the pesticide industry --
that they have ever witnessed.
This could totally revamp the pesticide industries throughout the world.
You could fly 100 Ph.D. students under the umbrella of this concept,
because my supposition is that entomopathogenic fungi,
prior to sporulation, attract the very insects
that are otherwise repelled by those spores.
The Life Box -- you're gonna be getting a DVD of the TED conference --
you add soil, you add water,
you have mycorrhizal and endophytic fungi as well as spores,
like of the Agarikon mushroom.
The seeds then are mothered by this mycelium.
And then you put tree seeds in here,
and then you end up growing -- potentially --
an old-growth forest from a cardboard box.
and the use of cardboard around the world,
so they become ecological footprints.
If there's a YouTube-like site that you could put up,
you could make it interactive, zip code specific --
where people could join together,
and through satellite imaging systems,
through Virtual Earth or Google Earth,
you could confirm carbon credits are being sequestered
by the trees that are coming through Life Boxes.
you could add water -- I developed this for the refugee community --
corns, beans and squash and onions.
I took several containers -- my wife said, if I could do this, anybody could --
and I ended up growing a seed garden.
Then you harvest the seeds --
and thank you, Eric Rasmussen, for your help on this --
and then you're harvesting the seed garden.
Then you can harvest the kernels, and then you just need a few kernels.
I add mycelium to it, and then I inoculate the corncobs.
Now, three corncobs, no other grain --
lots of mushrooms begin to form.
Too many withdrawals from the carbon bank,
and so this population will be shut down.
But watch what happens here.
The mushrooms then are harvested,
but very importantly,
the mycelium has converted the cellulose into fungal sugars.
And so I thought, how could we address the energy crisis in this country?
And we came up with Econol.
and you gain all the benefits that I've described to you already.
But to go from cellulose to ethanol is ecologically unintelligent,
and I think that we need to be econologically intelligent
about the generation of fuels.
So, we build the carbon banks on the planet, renew the soils.
These are a species that we need to join with.
I think engaging mycelium can help save the world.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here.
But I'm going see what happens if I press this button.
What happens to matter if you chop it up very fine?
What is it made of?
And the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe,
and they're very much connected with the history of the universe.
but those are at very, very small distances,
and we haven't really interacted with them very much yet.
The main thing I want to talk about is this:
that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics
that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory.
And why on earth could that be so?
It's fairly dramatic, actually, to have this happen.
Three or four of us, in 1957,
put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces, this weak force.
And it was in disagreement with seven -- seven, count them, seven experiments.
Experiments were all wrong.
because we figured it was so beautiful, it's gotta be right!
The experiments had to be wrong, and they were.
Now our friend over there, Albert Einstein,
used to pay very little attention when people said,
"You know, there's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity.
DC Miller. What about that?" And he would say, "Aw, that'll go away." (Laughter)
Now, yeah, what do we mean by beautiful? That's one thing.
I'll try to make that clear -- partially clear.
Why should it work, and is this something to do with human beings?
I'll let you in on the answer to the last one that I offer,
and that is, it has nothing to do with human beings.
Somewhere in some other planet, orbiting some very distant star,
maybe in a another galaxy,
there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are,
and are interested in science. It's not impossible; I think there probably are lots.
But they could be out there, very easily.
And suppose they have, you know, very different sensory apparatus, and so on.
They have seven tentacles, and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes,
and a brain shaped like a pretzel.
Would they really have different laws?
There are lots of people who believe that, and I think it is utter baloney.
I think there are laws out there,
and we of course don't understand them at any given time very well
-- but we try. And we try to get closer and closer.
of the particles and forces, what I call the "fundamental law."
We may not even be terribly far from it.
But even if we don't run across it in our lifetimes,
we can still think there is one out there,
and we're just trying to get closer and closer to it.
I think that's the main point to be made.
We express these things mathematically.
And when the mathematics is very simple --
when in terms of some mathematical notation,
you can write the theory in a very brief space, without a lot of complication --
that's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance.
Newton certainly believed that.
And he said, here, "It is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws."
The basic law, let's say -- here's an assumption.
The assumption is that the basic law really takes the form
of a unified theory of all the particles.
Now, some people call that a theory of everything.
That's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical.
And I won't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it's like, and so on.
You've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway. (Laughter)
There are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff.
Now, sometimes those probabilities are near certainties.
And in a lot of familiar cases, they of course are.
But other times they're not, and you have only probabilities for different outcomes.
So what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law.
It's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents,
or chance outcomes, that are there in addition.
So it's not a theory of everything. And in fact, a huge amount of the information
in the universe around us comes from those accidents,
and not just from the fundamental laws.
Now, it's often said that getting closer and closer
to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies, and then higher energies,
and then higher energies, or short distances, and then shorter distances,
and then still shorter distances, and so on, is like peeling the skin of an onion.
And we keep doing that,
and build more powerful machines, accelerators for particles.
We look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles,
and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law.
and we get closer and closer to the underlying law,
we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one,
and with the next one. We write them out mathematically,
and we see they use very similar mathematics.
They require very similar mathematics.
That is absolutely remarkable, and that is a central feature
of what I'm trying to say today.
Newton called it -- that's Newton, by the way -- that one.
he said, "nature conformable to herself" -- personifying nature as a female.
And so what happens is that the new phenomena,
the new skins, the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion
that we get to, resemble the slightly larger ones.
And the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin
is almost the same as what we need for the next skin.
And that's why the equations look so simple.
Because they use mathematics we already have.
which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated.
Coulomb, in France, found the same law for electric charges.
Here's an example of this similarity.
You look at gravity, you see a certain law.
Then you look at electricity. Sure enough. The same rule.
It's a very simple example.
There are lots of more sophisticated examples.
Symmetry is very important in this discussion.
You know what it means. A circle, for example,
is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle.
You rotate around the center of the circle, the circle remains unchanged.
You take a sphere, in three dimensions, you rotate around the center of the sphere,
and all those rotations leave the sphere alone.
They are symmetries of the sphere.
So we say, in general, that there's a symmetry
under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon,
or its description, unchanged.
under rotations of all of space.
Doesn't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle,
it doesn't leave the -- doesn't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism.
There's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this,
and if you use that notation, the equations get a lot simpler.
Then Einstein, with his special theory of relativity,
looked at a whole set of symmetries of Maxwell's equations,
which are called special relativity.
And those symmetries, then, make the equations even shorter, and even prettier, therefore.
But you can just look at the form. (Laughter) You can look at the form.
You see above, at the top, a long list
of equations with three components for the three directions of space: x, y and z.
Then, using vector analysis, you use rotational symmetry, and you get this next set.
Then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set
down here, showing that symmetry exhibits better and better.
The more and more symmetry you have, the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory.
give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields.
The next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that.
The only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents.
Someday we may find some slight hole in that argument.
But for the moment, that's the case.
They should have heard of it, but it's a little tricky to explain in technical detail,
so I won't do it. I'll just mention it. (Laughter)
But Chen Ning Yang, called by us "Frank" Yang -- (Laughter)
-- and Bob Mills put forward, 50 years ago,
this generalization of Maxwell's equations, with a new symmetry.
A whole new symmetry.
Mathematics very similar, but there was a whole new symmetry.
They hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics
-- didn't. It didn't, by itself, contribute to particle physics.
And it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force.
So here we say, again, what we said before:
that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins.
So the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one.
And therefore it looks beautiful
because we already know how to write it in a lovely, concise way.
Steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity.
Symmetry exhibits the simplicity.
And then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words,
from one skin of the onion to another one.
Proximate self-similarity. And that accounts for this phenomenon.
"Nature is very consonant and conformable to her self."
One thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today,
Four sources told it. That when they had the plague in Cambridge,
and he went down to his mother's farm -- because the university was closed --
he saw an apple fall from a tree, or on his head or something.
And he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth
It's the same theory of gravity.
So he said that this principle of nature, consonance:
"This principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers,
I forbore to describe it in that book,
lest I should be accounted an extravagant freak ... "
That's what we all have to watch out for, (Laughter) especially at this meeting.
" ... and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book."
That the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground
is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around,
and so on? Everybody knows that. It's a property of gravitation.
It's not something in the human mind. The human mind can, of course, appreciate it
and enjoy it, use it, but it's not -- it doesn't stem from the human mind.
It stems from the character of gravity.
And that's true of all the things we're talking about.
They are properties of the fundamental law.
The fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another,
and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply
the phenomenon of the next skin.
gravity, the laws of motion, the calculus, white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow.
And he could have written quite an essay on "What I Did Over My Summer Vacation."
(Laughter)
So we don't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates.
You don't need -- you don't need something more to get something more.
That's what emergence means.
The human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents,
and they say, "Isn't there something more beyond what you have there?"
Presumably, they mean something supernatural.
Anyway, there isn't. (Laughter)
You don't need something more to explain something more.
Thank you very much. (Applause)
♫ Jill Sobule: At a conference in Monterey by the big, big jellyfish tank, ♫
ever since I was writing that pilot for Fox, and Wendy
and I wanted you to do the theme song.
And then the pilot didn't go and I was so sad,
but I kept remaining a fan of yours.
And then when I went through that big, horrible breakup with Carl
and I couldn't get off the couch, I listened to your song,
♫ "Now That I Don't Have You," ♫ over and over and over and over again.
And I can't believe you're here and that I'm meeting you here at TED.
And also, I can't believe that we're eating sushi

(Applause)
I mean, I watch Oprah mostly when I'm home in Spokane
visiting my mother. And to my mother,
Oprah is a greater moral authority than the Pope,
which is actually saying something because she's a devout Catholic.
Anyway, I like Oprah -- I like her girlfriendy-ness,
I like her weight issues,
I like how she's transformed talk television,
I like how she's brought reading back to America --
but there was something that happened the last two weeks
that was ... I call it the Soon-Yi moment:
it is the moment when I cannot continue supporting someone.
And that was that she did two entire shows
promoting that movie "The Secret."
Do you guys know about that movie "The Secret"?
It makes "What the Bleep Do We Know" seem like a doctoral dissertation
from Harvard on quantum mechanics -- that's how bad it is.
It makes "The DaVinci Code" seem like "War and Peace."
That movie is so horrible. It promotes such awful pseudoscience.
And the basic idea is
that there's this law of attraction, and
your thoughts have this vibrating energy
that goes out into the universe
and then you attract good things to happen to you.
On a scientific basis, it's more than just "Power of Positive Thinking" --
it has a horrible, horrible dark side. Like if you get ill,
it's because you've just been thinking negative thoughts.
Yeah, stuff like that was in the movie and she's promoting it.
And all I'm saying is that I really wish that Murray Gell-Mann
would go on Oprah
and just explain to her that the law of attraction is, in fact, not a law.
So that's what I have to say.
(Laughter)
What is bioenergy? Bioenergy is not ethanol.
Bioenergy isn't global warming. Bioenergy is
something which seems counterintuitive. Bioenergy
is oil. It's gas. It's coal. And part of building
that bridge to the future, to the point where we
can actually see the oceans in a rational way, or
put up these geo-spatial orbits that will twirl or
do microwaves or stuff, is going to depend on how
we understand bioenergy and manage it. And to do
that, you really have to look first at agriculture.
in the measure that we plant stuff, what we learn
from agriculture is you've got to deal with pests,
you've got to deal with all types of awful things,
you've got to cultivate stuff. In the measure
that you learn how to use water to cultivate, then
you're going to be able to spread beyond the Nile.
You're going to be able to power stuff, so irrigation
makes a difference.
stuff where you want it, as opposed to where the
rivers flood. You start getting this organic
agriculture; you start putting machinery onto this
stuff. Machinery, with a whole bunch of water,
leads to very large-scale agriculture.
You put together machines and water, and you get
landscapes that look like this. And then you get
sales that look like this. It's brute force. So
what you've been doing in agriculture is you start
out with something that's a reasonably natural
system. You start taming that natural system. You
put a lot of force behind that natural system. You
put a whole bunch of pesticides and herbicides --
(Laughter) -- behind that natural system, and you
end up with systems that look like this.
been approaching energy. So the lesson in
agriculture is that you can actually change the
system that's based on brute force as you start
merging that system and learning that system and
actually applying biology. And you move from a
discipline of engineering, you move from a
discipline of chemistry, into a discipline of
biology. And probably one of the most important
human beings on the planet is this guy behind me.
Nobel Prize. He's got the Congressional Medal of
Honor. He deserves all of this stuff. And he
deserves this stuff because he probably has fed
more people than any other human being alive
because he researched how to put biology behind
seeds. He did this in Mexico. The reason why India
and China no longer have these massive famines is
because Norman Borlaug taught them how to grow
grains in a more efficient way and launched the
Green Revolution. That is something that a lot of
people have criticized. But of course, those are
people who don't realize that China and India,
instead of having huge amounts of starving people,
are exporting grains.
place where he did the research, which was Mexico,
didn't adopt this technology, ignored this
technology, talked about why this technology
should be thought about, but not really applied.
And Mexico remains one of the largest grain
importers on the planet because it doesn't apply
technology that was discovered in Mexico. And in
fact, hasn't recognized this man, to the point
where there aren't statues of this man all over
Mexico. There are in China and India. And the
Institute that this guy ran has now moved to
India. That is the difference between adopting
technologies and discussing technologies.
Now, it's not just that this guy fed a huge amount
of people in the world. It's that this is the net
effect in terms of what technology does, if you
understand biology.
agriculture over a century, agriculture in about
1900 would have been recognizable to somebody
planting a thousand years earlier. Yeah, the plows look
different. The machines were tractors or stuff
instead of mules, but the farmer would have
understood: this is what the guy's doing, this is
why he's doing it, this is where he's going. What
really started to change in agriculture is when
you started moving from this brute force
engineering and chemistry into biology, and that's
where you get your productivity increases. And as
you do that stuff, here's what happens to
productivity.
bushels, to 40, to 15, to five. Agricultural labor
productivity increased seven times, 1950 to 2000,
whereas the rest of the economy increased about
2.5 times. This is an absolutely massive increase
in how much is produced per person.
The effect of this, of course, is it's not just
amber waves of grain, it is mountains of stuff.
And 50 percent of the EU budget is going to subsidize
agriculture from mountains of stuff that people
have overproduced.
course, by now, you're probably saying to
yourself, "Self, I thought I came to a talk about
energy and here's this guy talking about biology."
So where's the link between these two things?
One of the ironies of this whole system is we're
discussing what to do about a system that we don't
understand. We don't even know what oil is. We
don't know where oil comes from. I mean,
literally, it's still a source of debate what
this black river of stuff is and where it comes
from. The best assumption, and one of the best
guesses in this stuff, is that this stuff comes
out of this stuff, that these things absorb
sunlight, rot under pressure for millions of
years, and you get these black rivers.
that thesis turns out to be true -- is that oil,
and all hydrocarbons, turned out to be
concentrated sunlight. And if you think of
bioenergy, bioenergy isn't ethanol. Bioenergy is
taking the sun, concentrating it in amoebas,
concentrating it in plants, and maybe that's why
you get these rainbows.
And as you're looking at this system, if
hydrocarbons are concentrated sunlight, then
bioenergy works in a different way. And we've got
to start thinking of oil and other hydrocarbons as
part of these solar panels.
Maybe that's one of the reasons why if you fly
over west Texas, the types of wells that you're
beginning to see don't look unlike those pictures
of Kansas and those irrigated plots.
farming oil and how oil has evolved, we started
with this brute force approach. And then what did
we learn? Then we learned we had to go bigger. And
then what'd we learn? Then we have to go even
bigger. And we are getting really destructive as
we're going out and farming this bioenergy.
These are the Athabasca tar sands, and there's an
enormous amount -- first of mining, the largest
trucks in the world are working here, and then
you've got to pull out this black sludge, which is
basically oil that doesn't flow. It's tied to the
sand. And then you've got to use a lot of steam to
separate it, which only works at today's oil
prices.
stuff. It is probably plants, except that these
have been burned and crushed under pressure.
So you take something like this, you burn it, you
put it under pressure, and likely as not, you get
this. Although, again, I stress: we don't know.
Which is curious as we debate all this stuff. But
as you think of coal, this is what burned wheat
kernels look like. Not entirely unlike coal.
places because in some of these coalmines, you
get gas. When that gas blows up, people die. So
you're producing a biogas out of coal in some
mines, but not in others.
Any place you see a differential, there're some
interesting questions. There's some questions as
to what you should be doing with this stuff. But
again, coal. Maybe the same stuff, maybe the same
system, maybe bioenergy, and you're applying
exactly the same technology.
through your brute force approach, then you just
rip off whole mountaintops. And you end up with
the single largest source of carbon emissions,
which are coal-fired gas plants. That is probably
not the best use of bioenergy.
As you think of what are the alternatives to this
system -- it's important to find alternatives
because it turns out that the U.S. is dwindling in
its petroleum reserves, but it is not dwindling in
its coal reserves, nor is China. There are huge
coal reserves that are sitting out there, and
we've got to start thinking of them as biological
energy, because if we keep treating them as
chemical energy, or engineering energy, we're
going to be in deep doo-doo.
product. And as you think of gas, well, you're
familiar with gas. And here's a different way of
mining coal.
This is called coal bed methane. Why is this
picture interesting? Because if coal turns out to
be concentrated plant life, the reason why you may
get a differential in gas output between one mine
and another -- the reason why one mine may blow up
and another one may not blow up -- may be because
there's stuff eating that stuff and producing gas.
This is a well-known phenomenon. (Laughter) You
eat certain things, you produce a lot of gas. It
may turn out that biological processes in coalmines
have the same process. If that is true, then
one of the ways of getting the energy out of coal
may not be to rip whole mountaintops off, and it
may not be to burn coal. It may be to have stuff
process that coal in a biological fashion as you
did in agriculture.
is not subsidies to a few companies. It is not
importing corn into Iowa because you've built so
many of these ethanol plants. It is beginning to
understand the transition that occurred in
agriculture, from brute force into biological
force. And in the measure that you can do that,
you can clean some stuff, and you can clean it
pretty quickly.
We already have some indicators of productivity on
this stuff. OK, if you put steam into coal fields
or petroleum fields that have been running for
decades, you can get a really substantial
increase, like an eight-fold increase, in your
output. This is just the beginning stages of this
stuff.
did part of the sequencing of the human genome,
who just doubled the databases of genes and
proteins known on earth by sailing around the
world -- has been thinking about how you structure
this. And there's a series of smart people
thinking about this. And they've been putting
together companies like Synthetic Genomics, like,
a Cambria, like Codon, and what those companies are
trying to do is to think of, how do you apply
biological principles to avoid brute force?
Think of it in the following terms. Think of it as
beginning to program stuff for specific purposes.
Think of the cell as a hardware. Think of the
genes as a software. And in the measure that you
begin to think of life as code that is
interchangeable, that can become energy, that can
become food, that can become fiber, that can
become human beings, that can become a whole
series of things, then you've got to shift your
approach as to how you're going to structure and
deal and think about energy in a very different
way.
where are we heading? This is one of the gentle
giants on the planet. He's one of the nicest human
beings you've ever met. His name is Hamilton
Smith. He won the Nobel for figuring out how to
cut genes -- something called restriction enzymes.
He was at Hopkins when he did this, and he's such
a modest guy that the day he won, his mother
called him and said, "I didn't realize there was
another Ham Smith at Hopkins. Do you know he just
won the Nobel?" (Laughter) I mean, that was Mom,
but anyway, this guy is just a class act. You find
him at the bench every single day, working on a
pipette and building stuff. And one of the things
this guy just built are these things.
naked DNA, where you take an entire DNA operating
system out of one cell, insert it into a different
cell, and have that cell boot up as a separate
species. That's one month old. You will see stuff
in the next month that will be just as important
as this stuff.
And as you think about this stuff and what the
implications of this are, we're going to start not
just converting ethanol from corn with very high
subsidies. We're going to start thinking about
biology entering energy. It is very expensive to
process this stuff, both in economic terms and in
energy terms.
Alberta. These are sulfur blocks. Because as you
separate that petroleum from the sand, and use an
enormous amount of energy inside that vapor --
steam to separate this stuff -- you also have to
separate out the sulfur. The difference between
light crude and heavy crude -- well, it's about 14
bucks a barrel. That's why you're building these
pyramids of sulfur blocks. And by the way, the
scale on these things is pretty large.
out of doing this, you reduce the system, and you
really do start applying biological principles to
energy. This has to be a bridge to the point where
you can get to wind, to the point where you can
get to solar, to the point where you can get to
nuclear -- and hopefully you won't build the next
nuclear plant on a beautiful seashore next to an
earthquake fault. (Laughter) Just a thought.
the name of the game is hydrocarbons. And be that
oil, be that gas, be that coal, this is what we're
dealing with. And before I make this talk too
long, here's what's happening in the current
energy system.
86 percent of the energy we consume are
hydrocarbons. That means 86 percent of the stuff we're
consuming are probably processed plants and
amoebas and the rest of the stuff. And there's a
role in here for conservation. There's a role in
here for alternative stuff, but we've also got to
get that other portion right.
How we deal with that other portion is our bridge
to the future. And as we think of this bridge to
the future, one of the things you should ponder
is: we are leaving about two-thirds of the oil today
inside those wells. So we're spending an enormous
amount of money and leaving most of the energy
down there. Which, of course, requires more energy
to go out and get energy. The ratios become
idiotic by the time you get to ethanol. It may
even be a one-to-one ratio on the energy input and
the energy output. That is a stupid way of
managing this system.
we've got to do is to stabilize oil prices. This
is what oil prices look like, OK?
This is a very bad system because what happens is
your hurdle rate gets set very low. People come up
with really smart ideas for solar panels, or for
wind, or for something else, and then guess what?
The oil price goes through the floor. That company
goes out of business, and then you can bring the
oil price back up.
let's set a stable oil price in Europe and the
United States. How do you do that? Well, let's put
a tax on oil that is a non-revenue tax, and it
basically says for the next 20 years, the price of
oil will be -- whatever you want, 35 bucks, 40
bucks. If the OPEC price falls below that, we tax
it. If the OPEC price goes above that, the tax
goes away.
What does that do for entrepreneurs? What does it
produce energy for less than 35 bucks a barrel, or
less than 40 bucks a barrel, or less than 50 bucks
a barrel -- let's debate it -- you will have a
business. But let's not put people through this
cycle where it doesn't pay to research because
your company will go out of business as OPEC
drives alternatives and keeps bioenergy from
happening. Thank you.
I'm going to try and explain why it is that perhaps
we don't understand as much as we think we do.
I'd like to begin with four questions.
This is not some sort of cultural thing for the time of year.
That's an in-joke, by the way.
But these four questions, actually,
are ones that people who even know quite a lot about science find quite hard.
And they're questions that I've asked of science television producers,
of audiences of science educators --
so that's science teachers -- and also of seven-year-olds,
and I find that the seven-year-olds do marginally better
than the other audiences, which is somewhat surprising.
either on a bit of paper, physically, or a virtual piece of paper
in your head. And, for viewers at home, you can try this as well.
A little seed weighs next to nothing and a tree weighs a lot, right?
I think we agree on that. Where does the tree get the stuff that makes up this chair,
right? Where does all this stuff come from?
(Knocks)
with a battery, a bulb and one piece of wire?
And would you be able to, kind of, draw a -- you don't have to draw
the diagram, but would you be able to draw the diagram,
if you had to do it? Or would you just say,
that's actually not possible?
I think we can probably agree that it is hotter in summer than in winter,
but why? And finally, would you be able to --
and you can sort of scribble it, if you like --
scribble a plan diagram of the solar system,
showing the shape of the planets' orbits?
Would you be able to do that?
And if you can, just scribble a pattern.
as teachers often think, but actually from common sense,
from experience of the world around them,
from all the things that go on between them and their peers,
and their carers, and their parents, and all of that. Experience.
And one of the great experts in this field, of course, was, bless him,
Cardinal Wolsey. Be very careful what you get into people's heads
because it's virtually impossible to shift it afterwards, right?
(Laughter)
I'm not quite sure how he died, actually.
Was he beheaded in the end, or hung?
(Laughter)
Now, those questions, which, of course, you've got right,
and you haven't been conferring, and so on.
And I -- you know, normally, I would pick people out and humiliate,
but maybe not in this instance.
99 percent of this stuff, came out of the air.
Now, I guarantee that about 85 percent of you, or maybe it's fewer at TED,
will have said it comes out of the ground. And some people,
probably two of you, will come up and argue with me afterwards,
and say that actually, it comes out of the ground.
Now, if that was true, we'd have trucks going round the country,
filling people's gardens in with soil, it'd be a fantastic business.
But, actually, we don't do that.
The mass of this comes out of the air.
Now, I passed all my biology exams in Britain.
I passed them really well, but I still came out of school
thinking that that stuff came out of the ground.
Yes, you can, and I'll show you in a second how to do that.
Now, I have some rather bad news,
which is that I had a piece of video that I was about to show you,
which unfortunately -- the sound doesn't work in this room,
so I'm going to describe to you, in true "Monty Python" fashion,
what happens in the video. And in the video, a group of researchers
go to MIT on graduation day.
We chose MIT because, obviously, that's a very long way away
from here, and you wouldn't mind too much,
but it sort of works the same way in Britain
and in the West Coast of the USA.
And we asked them these questions, and we asked those questions
of science graduates, and they couldn't answer them.
And so, there's a whole lot of people saying,
"I'd be very surprised if you told me that this came out of the air.
That's very surprising to me." And those are science graduates.
And we intercut it with, "We are the premier science university in the world,"
because of British-like hubris.
(Laughter)
And when we gave graduate engineers that question,
they said it couldn't be done.
And when we gave them a battery, and a piece of wire, and a bulb,
and said, "Can you do it?" They couldn't do it. Right?
And that's no different from Imperial College in London, by the way,
it's not some sort of anti-American thing going on.
for teaching people -- we might as well get it right.
And there are also some societal reasons
why we might want people to understand what it is that's happening
in photosynthesis. For example, one half of the carbon equation
is how much we emit, and the other half of the carbon equation,
as I'm very conscious as a trustee of Kew,
is how much things soak up, and they soak up carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere.
That's what plants actually do for a living.
And, for any Finnish people in the audience, this is a Finnish pun:
we are, both literally and metaphorically, skating on thin ice
if we don't understand that kind of thing.
Now, here's how you do the battery and the bulb.
It's so easy, isn't it? Of course, you all knew that.
But if you haven't played with a battery and a bulb,
if you've only seen a circuit diagram,
you might not be able to do that, and that's one of the problems.
We learn, as children, that you get closer to something that's hot,
and it burns you. It's a very powerful bit of learning,
and it happens pretty early on.
By extension, we think to ourselves, "Why it's hotter in summer than in winter
must be because we're closer to the Sun."
I promise you that most of you will have got that.
Oh, you're all shaking your heads,
but only a few of you are shaking your heads very firmly.
Other ones are kind of going like this. All right.
It's hotter in summer than in winter because the rays from the Sun
are spread out more, right, because of the tilt of the Earth.
And if you think the tilt is tilting us closer, no, it isn't.
The Sun is 93 million miles away, and we're tilting like this, right?
It makes no odds. In fact, in the Northern Hemisphere,
we're further from the Sun in summer,
as it happens, but it makes no odds, the difference.
If you believe, as most of you probably do,
that it's hotter in summer than in winter because we're closer to the Sun,
you must have drawn an ellipse.
Right? That would explain it, right?
Except, in your -- you're nodding -- now, in your ellipse,
have you thought, "Well, what happens during the night?"
Between Australia and here, right, they've got summer
and we've got winter, and what --
does the Earth kind of rush towards the Sun at night,
and then rush back again? I mean, it's a very strange thing going on,
and we hold these two models in our head, of what's right and what isn't right,
and we do that, as human beings, in all sorts of fields.
That's pretty much what you should have on your piece of paper. Right?
And this is NASA's view. They're stunningly similar.
I hope you notice the coincidence here.
What would you do if you knew that people had this misconception,
right, in their heads, of elliptical orbits
caused by our experiences as children?
What sort of diagram would you show them of the solar system,
to show that it's not really like that?
You'd show them something like this, wouldn't you?
It's a plan, looking down from above.
But, no, look what I found in the textbooks.
That's what you show people, right? These are from textbooks,
from websites, educational websites --
and almost anything you pick up is like that.
And the reason it's like that is because it's dead boring
to have a load of concentric circles,
whereas that's much more exciting, to look at something at that angle,
isn't it? Right? And by doing it at that angle,
if you've got that misconception in your head, then that
two-dimensional representation of a three-dimensional thing will be ellipses.
So you've -- it's crap, isn't it really? As we say.
So, these mental models -- we look for evidence that reinforces our models.
We do this, of course, with matters of race, and politics, and everything else,
and we do it in science as well. So we look, just look --
and scientists do it, constantly -- we look for evidence
that reinforces our models, and some folks are just all too able
and willing to provide the evidence that reinforces the models.
These are examples of what I would say is bad practice in science
teaching centers. These pictures are from La Villette in France
and the welcome wing of the Science Museum in London.
And, if you look at the, kind of the way these things are constructed,
there's a lot of mediation by glass, and it's very blue, and kind of professional --
in that way that, you know, Woody Allen comes up
from under the sheets in that scene in "Annie Hall,"
and said, "God, that's so professional." And that you don't --
there's no passion in it, and it's not hands on, right,
and, you know, pun intended. Whereas good interpretation --
I'll use an example from nearby -- is San Francisco Exploratorium,
where all the things that -- the demonstrations, and so on,
are made out of everyday objects that children can understand,
it's very hands-on, and they can engage with, and experiment with.
And I know that if the graduates at MIT
and in the Imperial College in London had had the battery and the wire
and the bit of stuff, and you know, been able to do it,
they would have learned how it actually works,
rather than thinking that they follow circuit diagrams and can't do it.
So good interpretation is more about
things that are bodged and stuffed and of my world, right?
And things that -- where there isn't an extra barrier
of a piece of glass or machined titanium,
and it all looks fantastic, OK?
And the Exploratorium does that really, really well.
And it's amateur, but amateur in the best sense,
in other words, the root of the word being of love and passion.
So, as "Monty Python" would have it,
this is a bit Lord Privy Seal to say so,
but this is -- children are not empty vessels.
They come with their own ideas and their own theories,
and unless you work with those, then you won't be able to shift them,
right? And I probably haven't shifted your ideas
of how the world and universe operates, either.
But this applies, equally, to matters of trying to sell new technology.
For example, we are, in Britain, we're trying to do a digital switchover
of the whole population into digital technology [for television].
And it's one of the difficult things
is that when people have preconceptions of how it all works,
it's quite difficult to shift those.
So we're not empty vessels; the mental models that we have
as children persist into adulthood.
Poor teaching actually does more harm than good.
In this country and in Britain, magnetism is understood better
by children before they've been to school than afterwards, OK?
Same for gravity, two concepts, so it's -- which is quite humbling,
as a, you know, if you're a teacher, and you look before and after,
that's quite worrying. They do worse in tests afterwards, after the teaching.
And we collude. We design tests,
or at least in Britain, so that people pass them. Right?
And governments do very well. They pat themselves on the back.
OK? We collude, and actually if you --
if someone had designed a test for me
when I was doing my biology exams,
to really understand, to see whether I'd understood
more than just kind of putting starch and iodine together
and seeing it go blue,
and really understood that plants took their mass out of the air,
then I might have done better at science.
So the most important thing is to get people to articulate their models.
An obvious question, and you'll have an answer now in your heads.
And the second question to that then is,
ensure you've explained how it is that planes can fly upside down.
Ah ha, right. Second question is, why is the sea blue? All right?
And you've all got an idea in your head of the answer.
So, why is it blue on cloudy days? Ah, see.
(Laughter)
I've always wanted to say that in this country.
(Laughter)
Finally, my plea to you is to allow yourselves, and your children,
and anyone you know, to kind of fiddle with stuff,
because it's by fiddling with things that you, you know,
you complement your other learning. It's not a replacement,
it's just part of learning that's important.
Thank you very much.
Now -- oh, oh yeah, go on then, go on.
(Applause)

to the game-development community.
last week announced that Electronic Arts, one of the largest game publishers,
Shortly after I saw that, we had some friends over for dinner
with the family. The conversation turned to global warming,
and everybody agreed, there's a real problem.
We've got a climate crisis.
So, we went around the table to talk about what we should do.
She said, "I agree with everything that's been said.
I'm scared and I'm angry." And then she turned to me and said,
"Dad, your generation created this problem; you'd better fix it." Wow.
All the conversation stopped. All the eyes turned to me.
(Laughter)
I didn't know what to say. Kleiner's second law is,
"There is a time when panic is the appropriate response."
(Laughter)
I've got to tell you, for me, everything changed that evening.
We went to Brazil. We went to China and to India,
Because the more we learned, the more concerned we grew.
You know, my partners at Kleiner and I were compulsive networkers,
we just get together the smartest people we know.
and four lessons I've learned in the last year.
and their new stores by 30 percent, and do all that in seven years.
The three biggest uses of energy in a store are heating
and air conditioning, then lighting, and then refrigeration.
They painted the roofs of all their stores white.
They put smart skylights through their stores
so they could harvest the daylight and reduce the lighting demands.
And, third, they put the refrigerated goods
behind closed doors with LED lighting.
I mean, why would you try to refrigerate a whole store?
These are really simple, smart solutions based on existing technology.
They're the largest private employer in America.
They're the largest private user of electricity.
They have the second-largest vehicle fleet on the road.
And they have one of the world's most amazing supply chains,
it would be the sixth-largest trading partner with China.
And maybe most important, they have a big effect on other companies.
it has a powerful impact on other great institutions.
that's going to be a very big deal. But I'm afraid it's not enough.
We need Wal-Mart and every other company to do the same.
I've got another Wal-Mart story for you, OK?
Wal-Mart has over 125 million U.S. customers.
That's a third of the U.S. population.
65 million compact fluorescent light bulbs were sold last year.
Consumers don't really like these light bulbs.
The light's kind of funny, they won't dim,
takes a while for them to start up.
But the pay-off is really enormous.
100 million compact fluorescent light bulbs means
that we'll save 600 million dollars in energy bills,
and 20 million tons of CO2 every year, year in and year out.
It does seem really hard to get consumers to do the right thing.
It is stupid that we use two tons of steel, glass and plastic
It's stupid that we put water in plastic bottles
in Fiji and ship it here.
(Laughter)
Do you know how much CO2 you generated to drive here or fly here?
I don't know, and I should.
Those of us who care about all this would act better
if we knew what the real costs were.
But as long as we pretend that CO2 is free,
we can reasonably expect from individuals
are going to be clearly not enough.
In fact, policy is paramount.
I've got a behind-the-scenes story for you
about that green tech network I described.
At the end of our first meeting, we got together to talk about
what the action items would be, how we'd follow up.
And Bob Epstein raised a hand. He stood up.
You know, Bob's that Berkeley techie type who started Sybase.
Well, Bob said the most important thing we could do right now
is to make it clear in Sacramento, California
that we need a market-based system of mandates
that's going to cap and reduce greenhouse gases in California.
It's necessary and, just as important,
it's good for the California economy.
with the seven undecided legislators and we lobbied for AB32.
You know what? Six of those seven voted yes in favor of the bill,
so it passed, and it passed by a vote of 47 to 32.
(Applause)
Please. Thank you.
Because California was the first state in this country
four billion dollars a year in annual income, and reduce the CO2 emissions
California emits only seven percent of U.S. CO2 emissions.
It's only a percent and a half of the country's CO2 emissions. It's a great start,
but I've got to tell you -- where I started -- I'm really afraid.
In fact, I'm certain California's not enough.
You know Tom Friedman says, "If you don't go, you don't know"?
Well, we went to Brazil to meet Dr. Jose Goldemberg.
He's the father of the ethanol revolution.
He told us that Brazil's government mandated
that every gasoline station in the country would carry ethanol.
And they mandated that their new vehicles
would be flex-fuel compatible, right?
They'd run ethanol or ordinary gasoline.
And so, here's what's happened in Brazil.
They now have 29,000 ethanol pumps --
this versus 700 in the U.S., and a paltry two in California --
and in three years their new car fleet
has gone from four percent to 85 percent flex-fuel.
Compare that to the U.S.: five percent are flex-fuel.
That's 59 billion dollars since 1975
that they didn't ship to the Middle East.
It's created a million jobs inside that country,
and it's saved 32 million tons of CO2. It's really substantial.
That's 10 percent of the CO2 emissions across their entire country.
But Brazil's only 1.3 percent of the world's CO2 emission.
are not going to be enough.
is about the potential of radical innovation.
So, I want to tell you about a tragic problem
and a breakthrough technology.
Every year a million and a half people die of
a completely preventable disease. That's malaria. 6,000 people a day.
All for want of two dollars' worth of medications
that we can buy at the corner drugstore.
Well, two dollars, two dollars is too much for Africa.
So, a team of Berkeley researchers with 15 million dollars
from the Gates Foundation is engineering, designing a radical new way
to make the key ingredient, called artemisinin,
and they're going to make that drug 10 times cheaper.
And in doing so, they'll save a million lives --
Their breakthrough technology is synthetic biology.
that they're using can be used to make better biofuels.
Don't let me skip over that. Better biofuels are a really big deal.
That means we can precisely engineer the molecules in the fuel chain
and optimize them along the way.
that are eating and digesting sugars to excrete better biofuels.
I guess that's better living through bugs.
And, of course, at Kleiner we, kind of, apologize and say
in a wide range of really disruptive new technologies
for innovation in green technologies.
And we're encouraging others to do it as well.
We're talking a lot about this.
of the sort you see here. It doubled in 2006 to 1.2 billion dollars.
For reference, fact one:
Exxon's revenues in 2005 were a billion dollars a day.
Do you know, they only invested 0.2 percent of revenues in R&D?
Second fact: the President's new budget for renewable energy
Less than one day of Exxon's revenues.
Third fact: I bet you didn't know that there's enough energy
in hot rocks under the country to supply America's energy needs
for the next thousand years. And the federal budget
calls for a measly 20 million dollars of R&D in geothermal energy.
It is almost criminal that we are not investing more
in energy research in this country.
And I am really afraid that it's absolutely not enough.
Who would have thought that a mass retailer
could make money by going green? Who would have thought that
a database entrepreneur could transform California with legislation?
Who would have thought that the ethanol biofuel miracle
would come from a developing country in South America?
And who would have thought that scientists
trying to cure malaria could come up with breakthroughs in biofuels?
And who would have thought that all that is not enough?
Not enough to stabilize the climate.
Not enough to keep the ice in Greenland from crashing into the ocean.
The scientists tell us -- and they're only guessing --
that we've got to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by one half,
and do it as fast as possible.
Now, we may have the political will to do this in the U.S.,
and so somehow we're going to have to find the political will
the U.S. is 5.8. Business as usual means
we'll have 23 gigatons from China by 2050.
That's about as much CO2 as there is in the whole world.
And if it's business as usual, we're going out of business.
When I was in Davos, China's Mayor of Dalian was pressed
about their CO2 strategy, and he said the following,
"You know, Americans use seven times the CO2 per capita as Chinese."
Then he asked, "Why should China sacrifice our growth
so that the West can continue to be profligate and stupid?"
We've got to make this economic so that all people and all nations
make the right outcome, the profitable outcome,
and therefore the likely outcome.
Moreover, if we succeed, it's going to be
the most important transformation for life on the planet since,
as Bill Joy says, we went from methane to oxygen in the atmosphere.
Everyone here cares about changing the world

What can you do? You can personally get carbon neutral.

is to use your personal power and your Rolodex
to lead your business, your institution, in going green.
Do it like Wal-Mart, get it to go green
for its customers and its suppliers and for itself.
Really think outside the box.
Can you imagine what it would be like if Amazon or eBay or Google
or Microsoft or Apple really went green and you caused that to happen?
It could be bigger than Wal-Mart.
to the conversation I'm going to have with my daughter in 20 years.
(Applause)
I think all of us have been interested, at one time or another,
in the romantic mysteries of all those societies that collapsed,
such as the classic Maya in the Yucatan, the Easter Islanders,
the Anasazi, Fertile Crescent society, Angor Wat, Great Zimbabwe
and so on. And within the last decade or two,
archaeologists have shown us that there were environmental problems
underlying many of these past collapses.
But there were also plenty of places in the world
where societies have been developing for thousands of years
without any sign of a major collapse,
such as Japan, Java, Tonga and Tikopea. So evidently, societies
in some areas are more fragile than in other areas.
How can we understand what makes some societies more fragile
than other societies? The problem is obviously relevant
to our situation today, because today as well, there are
some societies that have already collapsed, such as Somalia
and Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia. There are also
societies today that may be close to collapse, such as Nepal, Indonesia and Columbia.
What is there that we can learn from the past that would help us avoid
declining or collapsing in the way that so many past societies have?
Obviously the answer to this question is not going
to be a single factor. If anyone tells you that there is a single-factor
explanation for societal collapses, you know right away
that they're an idiot. This is a complex subject.
But how can we make sense out of the complexities of this subject?
In analyzing societal collapses, I've arrived at a
five-point framework -- a checklist of things that I go through
to try and understand collapses. And I'll illustrate that five-point
framework by the extinction of the Greenland Norse society.
This is a European society with literate records,
so we know a good deal about the people and their motivation.
In AD 984 Vikings went out to Greenland, settled Greenland,
and around 1450 they died out -- the society collapsed,
and every one of them ended up dead.
the first item on the framework is to look for human impacts
on the environment: people inadvertently destroying the resource
base on which they depend. And in the case of the Viking Norse,
the Vikings inadvertently caused soil erosion and deforestation,
which was a particular problem for them because
they required forests to make charcoal, to make iron.
So they ended up an Iron Age European society, virtually
unable to make their own iron. A second item on my checklist is
climate change. Climate can get warmer or colder or dryer or wetter.
In the case of the Vikings -- in Greenland, the climate got colder
in the late 1300s, and especially in the 1400s. But a cold climate
isn't necessarily fatal, because the Inuit -- the Eskimos inhabiting
Greenland at the same time -- did better, rather than worse,
with cold climates. So why didn't the Greenland Norse as well?
friendly societies that may prop up a society. And if that
friendly support is pulled away, that may make a society
more likely to collapse. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
they had trade with the mother country -- Norway --
and that trade dwindled: partly because Norway got weaker,
partly because of sea ice between Greenland and Norway.
In the case of Norse Greenland, the hostiles were the Inuit --
the Eskimos sharing Greenland -- with whom the Norse
got off to bad relationships. And we know that the Inuit
killed the Norse and, probably of greater importance,
may have blocked access to the outer fjords, on which
the Norse depended for seals at a critical time of the year.
economic, social and cultural factors in the society that make it
more or less likely that the society will perceive and solve its
environmental problems. In the case of the Greenland Norse,
cultural factors that made it difficult for them
to solve their problems were: their commitments to a
Christian society investing heavily in cathedrals; their being
a competitive-ranked chiefly society; and their scorn for the Inuit,
from whom they refused to learn. So that's how the five-part
framework is relevant to the collapse and eventual extinction of the Greenland Norse.
For the past five years, I've been taking my wife and kids to
Southwestern Montana, where I worked as a teenager
on the hay harvest. And Montana, at first sight, seems
like the most pristine environment in the United States.
But scratch the surface, and Montana suffers from serious problems.
Going through the same checklist: human environmental impacts?
Yes, acute in Montana. Toxic problems from mine waste
have caused damage of billions of dollars.
Problems from weeds, weed control, cost Montana nearly
200 million dollars a year. Montana has lost agricultural areas
from salinization, problems of forest management,
problems of forest fires. Second item on my checklist:
climate change. Yes -- the climate in Montana is getting warmer
and drier, but Montana agriculture depends especially on irrigation
from the snow pack, and as the snow is melting -- for example,
as the glaciers in Glacier National Park are disappearing --
that's bad news for Montana irrigation agriculture.
that can sustain the society. In Montana today, more than half of
the income of Montana is not earned within Montana,
but is derived from out of state: transfer payments from
social security, investments and so on --
which makes Montana vulnerable to the rest of the United States.
as do all Americans, in being sensitive to problems
created by hostiles overseas affecting our oil supplies,
and terrorist attacks. And finally, last item on my checklist:
question of how political, economic, social, cultural attitudes
play into this. Montanans have long-held values, which today
seem to be getting in the way of their solving their own problems.
Long-held devotion to logging and to mines and to agriculture,
and to no government regulation; values that worked well
in the past, but they don't seem to be working well today.
for a lot of past societies and for many present societies.
Are there any general conclusions that arise?
In a way, just like Tolstoy's statement about every unhappy marriage
being different, every collapsed or endangered society is different --
they all have different details. But nevertheless, there are certain
common threads that emerge from these comparisons
of past societies that did or did not collapse
and threatened societies today. One interesting common thread
has to do with, in many cases, the rapidity of collapse
after a society reaches its peak. There are many societies
that don't wind down gradually, but they build up -- get richer
and more powerful -- and then within a short time, within a few decades
after their peak, they collapse. For example,
the classic lowland Maya of the Yucatan began to collapse in the
early 800s -- literally a few decades after the Maya were building
their biggest monuments, and Maya population was greatest.
within a couple of decades, maybe within a decade, of the time
when the Soviet Union was at its greatest power.
An analogue would be the growth of bacteria in a petri dish.
These rapid collapses are especially likely where there's
a mismatch between available resources and resource consumption,
or a mismatch between economic outlays and economic potential.
In a petri dish, bacteria grow. Say they double every generation,
and five generations before the end the petri dish is 15/16ths empty,
and then the next generation's 3/4ths empty, and the next generation
half empty. Within one generation after the petri dish still
being half empty, it is full. There's no more food and the bacteria have collapsed.
So, this is a frequent theme:
societies collapse very soon after reaching their peak in power.
about a society today, you should be looking not at the value
of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should
be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives
of the function. That's one general theme. A second general theme
is that there are many, often subtle environmental factors that make
some societies more fragile than others. Many of those factors
are not well understood. For example, why is it that in the Pacific,
of those hundreds of Pacific islands, why did Easter Island end up as
the most devastating case of complete deforestation?
It turns out that there were about nine different environmental
factors -- some, rather subtle ones -- that were working against
the Easter Islanders, and they involve fallout of volcanic tephra,
latitude, rainfall. Perhaps the most subtle of them
is that it turns out that a major input of nutrients
which protects island environments in the Pacific is from
the fallout of continental dust from central Asia.
Easter, of all Pacific islands, has the least input of dust
from Asia restoring the fertility of its soils. But that's
a factor that we didn't even appreciate until 1999.
are more fragile than others. And then finally,
another generalization. I'm now teaching a course
at UCLA, to UCLA undergraduates, on these collapses
of societies. What really bugs my UCLA undergraduate students is,
how on earth did these societies not see what they were doing?
How could the Easter Islanders have deforested their environment?
What did they say when they were cutting down the last palm tree?
Didn't they see what they were doing? How could societies
not perceive their impacts on the environments and stop in time?
And I would expect that, if our human civilization carries on,
then maybe in the next century people will be asking,
why on earth did these people today in the year 2003 not see
the obvious things that they were doing and take corrective action?
It seems incredible in the past. In the future, it'll seem
incredible what we are doing today. And so I've been
trying to develop a hierarchical set of considerations
about why societies fail to solve their problems --
why they fail to perceive the problems or, if they perceive them,
why they fail to tackle them. Or, if they tackle them,
why do they fail to succeed in solving them?
One blueprint for trouble, making collapse likely,
is where there is a conflict of interest between the short-term
interest of the decision-making elites and the long-term
interest of the society as a whole, especially if the elites
are able to insulate themselves from the consequences
of their actions. Where what's good in the short run for the elite
is bad for the society as a whole, there's a real risk of the elite
doing things that would bring the society down in the long run.
For example, among the Greenland Norse --
a competitive rank society -- what the chiefs really wanted
is more followers and more sheep and more resources
to outcompete the neighboring chiefs. And that led the chiefs
to do what's called flogging the land: overstocking the land,
forcing tenant farmers into dependency. And that made
the chiefs powerful in the short run,
but led to the society's collapse in the long run.
in the United States today. Especially because
the decision makers in the United States are frequently
able to insulate themselves from consequences
by living in gated compounds, by drinking bottled water
and so on. And within the last couple of years,
it's been obvious that the elite in the business world
correctly perceive that they can advance
their short-term interest by doing things that are
good for them but bad for society as a whole,
such as draining a few billion dollars out of Enron
and other businesses. They are quite correct
that these things are good for them in the short term,
although bad for society in the long term.
So, that's one general conclusion about why societies
make bad decisions: conflicts of interest.
is that it's particularly hard for a society to make
quote-unquote good decisions when there is a conflict involving
strongly held values that are good in many circumstances
but are poor in other circumstances. For example,
the Greenland Norse, in this difficult environment,
were held together for four-and-a-half centuries
by their shared commitment to religion,
and by their strong social cohesion. But those two things --
commitment to religion and strong social cohesion --
also made it difficult for them to change at the end
and to learn from the Inuit. Or today -- Australia.
One of the things that enabled Australia to survive
in this remote outpost of European civilization
for 250 years has been their British identity.
But today, their commitment to a British identity
is serving Australians poorly in their need to adapt
to their situation in Asia. So it's particularly difficult
to change course when the things that get you in trouble
are the things that are also the source of your strength.
Well, all of us know the dozen sorts of ticking time bombs
going on in the modern world, time bombs that have fuses
of a few decades to -- all of them, not more than 50 years,
and any one of which can do us in; the time bombs of water,
of soil, of climate change, invasive species,
the photosynthetic ceiling, population problems, toxics, etc., etc. --
listing about 12 of them. And while these time bombs --
none of them has a fuse beyond 50 years, and most of them
have fuses of a few decades -- some of them, in some places,
have much shorter fuses. At the rate at which we're going now,
the Philippines will lose all its accessible loggable forest
within five years. And the Solomon Islands are only
one year away from losing their loggable forest,
which is their major export. And that's going to be spectacular
for the economy of the Solomons. People often ask me,
Jared, what's the most important thing that we need to do
about the world's environmental problems?
And my answer is, the most important thing we need to do
is to forget about there being any single thing that is
the most important thing we need to do.
Instead, there are a dozen things, any one of which could do us in.
And we've got to get them all right, because if we solve 11,
we fail to solve the 12th -- we're in trouble. For example,
if we solve our problems of water and soil and population,
but don't solve our problems of toxics, then we are in trouble.
which means, by definition, that it cannot be maintained.
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades.
That means that those of us in this room who are less than
50 or 60 years old will see how these paradoxes are resolved,
and those of us who are over the age of 60 may not see
the resolution, but our children and grandchildren certainly will.
The resolution is going to achieve either of two forms:
either we will resolve these non-sustainable time-fuses
in pleasant ways of our own choice by taking remedial action,
or else these conflicts are going to get settled
in unpleasant ways not of our choice -- namely, by war,
disease or starvation. But what's for sure is that our
non-sustainable course will get resolved in one way or another
in a few decades. In other words, since the theme of this session
is choices, we have a choice. Does that mean that we should
get pessimistic and overwhelmed? I draw the reverse conclusion.
things beyond our control. Our biggest threat is not an asteroid
about to crash into us, something we can do nothing about.
Instead, all the major threats facing us today are problems
entirely of our own making. And since we made the problems,
we can also solve the problems. That then means that it's
entirely in our power to deal with these problems.
In particular, what can all of us do? For those of you
who are interested in these choices, there are lots of things
you can do. There's a lot that we don't understand,
and that we need to understand. And there's a lot that
we already do understand, but aren't doing, and that
we need to be doing. Thank you.
(Applause)
I don't have children.
I borrow my friends' children, so --
It's a summer program which aims to help kids
learn how to build the things that they think of.
So we build a lot of things,
they do come back bruised, scraped and bloody.
that's subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations.
There doesn't seem to be any limit on how crazy
child safety regulations can get.

or for sale with an item in the United States.
We put warnings on coffee cups
to tell us that the contents may be hot.
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object,
So, as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone

And despite all of our best efforts and intentions,
in whatever environment they can.
and about some simple things that we can do
This is "Five Dangerous Things."
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature
is a pivotal moment in any child's personal history.
Whether we remember it or not,
These mysteries are only revealed
From playing with it, they learn some basic principles about fire,
about intake, combustion, exhaust.
These are the three working elements of fire
that you have to have for a good, controlled fire.
And you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory.
they're going to learn things
that you can't get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys.
which I think is a terrible thing.
You know, it's a spatula, it's a pry bar,
it's a screwdriver and it's a blade, yeah.
And it's a powerful and empowering tool.
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber.
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10,
And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self
through a tool at a very young age.
always cut away from your body, keep the blade sharp, never force it --
and these are things kids can understand and practice with.
But you know, they're young. They heal fast.
they tend to atrophy over time.
But when you exercise them,
any given muscle adds strength to the whole system,
and that applies to your brain, too.
which have to do with visual acuity, 3D understanding,
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill,
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher.
Even if you don't know what the parts are,
puzzling out what they might be for
is a really good practice for the kids
to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart,
and no matter how complex they are,
are actually complex things made by other people,
and you can understand them.
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.
that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things
then rip the CD to an MP3, and play it on your very same computer.
You've just broken a law.
Technically, the RIAA could come and prosecute you.
It's an important lesson for kids to understand,
that some of these laws get broken by accident,
and that laws have to be interpreted.
when we're fooling around with things and breaking them open,
and taking them apart and using them for other things.
And also when we go out and drive a car.
Driving a car is a really empowering act for a young child,
so this is the alternate --
you can drive a car with your child.
these big things in the outside world,
that they're trying to get a grip on.
A car is a similar object, and they can get in a car and drive it.
And that really gives them a handle on a world
in a way that they don't often have access to.
Find a big empty lot, make sure there's nothing in it,
and that it's on private property, and let them drive your car.
It's very safe actually.
And it's fun for the whole family.
And by the use of pitching PowerPoints to VCs,
I have personally raised tens of millions of dollars
from VCs through PowerPoint pitches.
And turning to the other side of the equation,
what is the single most important thing
the VC is going to be investing in?
and make a lot of money in return.
So in the course of your VC pitch -- you have a very few minutes;
most should be less than half an hour --

"Done this before" is starting an enterprise, creating value,
and taking something from beginning to end.

"I've got a great idea in a business I know nothing about.

what else do I want to know as a VC?
I want to know that you have commitment.
That you are going to be here to the end.
your fingernails scratching as they draw you out.
I don't want another "me too" product.
And before you get to change the world,
you have to deal with that.
I need to know you have the ability to listen.
We've had a lot of experience.
Think about your pitch as a timeline.
It starts off, you walk in the door.
They know nothing whatsoever about you.
And it goes from beginning to end.
It can be a story or an experience.
But you've got to grab their emotional attention, focused on you,
within that first few seconds.
Everything has to reinforce this.
knock them out of the park.
You want to get them to such an emotional high

Any time you go backwards, any time you skip a step --

or basic items in your business.
or there's outside validation.
It can be sales; it can be you got an award for something;
it can be people have done it before;
says this makes sense.
That's two parts; it's got to be upside and believable.
You have to recover from those.
For example, anything that I know is not true.
Odds are I know somebody who's made a widget,
Anything I don't understand,
where I have to make the leap myself, in my own head,
And it's a very tricky path.
But if you can do it, it works really well.
or a stupid mistake or a line that's in the wrong place --
Bill Gates's PowerPoint presentation over here.
Here he is, one little guy, black jeans and stuff,
on a totally empty stage.
What's good? Short. Short bullet points.
Basically, none.
You look at the image and you've got the whole thing.
I look at the logo, and it ties it to my brain.
tell me how you make money on it.
For every X you sell, you get Y, or services of Z.
This helps to say you're bigger than just one little thing over here.
There's never been a company with no competition,
how are you going to prevent them from eating your lunch?
All this ties into the financial overview.
Two million? 100,000?
What's the capital structure up until this point?
And I look at the logo -- OK, good.
so I couldn't even see if I wanted to.
What am I looking at?
I usually do a Top 10, but we don't have time,
so: David's Top Five Presentation Tips.
Number five: always use presenter mode,
or Ovation, or presenter tools.
It lets you know exactly where you're going,
you'll have a very spare, Zen-like presentation,
but not good as a handout.
You're making a connection with your audience,
and you always want a one-on-one connection.
You've all seen lots of articles on climate change,
and here's yet another New York Times article,
just like every other darn one you've seen.
It says all the same stuff as all the other ones you've seen.
It even has the same amount of headline as all the other ones you've seen.
What's unusual about this one, maybe, is that it's from 1953.
And the reason I'm saying this
is that you may have the idea this problem is relatively recent.
That people have just sort of figured out about it, and now
with Kyoto and the Governator and people beginning to actually do something,
we may be on the road to a solution.
The fact is -- uh-uh.
We've known about this problem for 50 years, depending on how you count it.
We have talked about it endlessly over the last decade or so.
And we've accomplished close to zip.
You've seen this in various forms,
but maybe you haven't seen this one.
What this shows is that the rate of growth of our emissions is accelerating.
And that it's accelerating even faster
than what we thought was the worst case just a few years back.
So that red line there was something that a lot of skeptics said
the environmentalists only put in the projections
to make the projections look as bad as possible,
that emissions would never grow as fast as that red line.
But in fact, they're growing faster.
which shows this year's minimum of the Arctic Sea ice, and it's the lowest by far.
And the rate at which the Arctic Sea ice is going away is a lot quicker than models.
So despite all sorts of experts like me flying around the planet and
burning jet fuel, and politicians signing treaties --
in fact, you could argue the net effect of all this has been negative,
because it's just consumed a lot of jet fuel. (Laughter)
No, no! In terms of what we really need to do to put the brakes on
this very high inertial thing -- our big economy -- we've really hardly started.
Really, we're doing this, basically. Really, not very much.
The problem is absolutely soluble, and even soluble in a way that's reasonably cheap.
Cheap meaning sort of the cost of the military, not the cost of medical care.
Cheap meaning a few percent of GDP.
No, this is really important to have this sense of scale.
So the problem is soluble, and the way we should go about solving it is, say,
dealing with electricity production,
which causes something like 43-or-so percent and rising of CO2 emissions.
And we could do that by perfectly sensible things like conservation,
and wind power, nuclear power and coal to CO2 capture,
which are all things that are ready for giant scale deployment, and work.
All we lack is the action to actually spend the money to put those into place.
Instead, we spend our time talking.
What I'm going to talk to you about tonight is stuff we might do if we did nothing.
And it's this stuff in the middle here, which is what you do
if you don't stop the emissions quickly enough.
And you need to deal -- somehow break the link between human actions
that change climate, and the climate change itself. And that's particularly important
because, of course, while we can adapt to climate change --
and it's important to be honest here, there will be some benefits to climate change.
Oh, yes, I think it's bad. I've spent my whole life working to stop it.
But one of the reasons it's politically hard is there are winners and losers -- not all losers.
But, of course, the natural world, polar bears.
I spent time skiing across the sea ice for weeks at a time in the high Arctic.
They will completely lose.
And there's no adaption.
This geo-engineering idea, in it's simplest form, is basically the following.
You could put signed particles, say sulfuric acid particles -- sulfates --
into the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
where they'd reflect away sunlight and cool the planet.
And I know for certain that that will work.
Not that there aren't side effects, but I know for certain it will work.
And the reason is, it's been done.
And it was done not by us, not by me, but by nature.
in the stratosphere with a sort of atomic bomb-like cloud.
The result of that was pretty dramatic.
After that, and some previous volcanoes we have, you see
a quite dramatic cooling of the atmosphere.
So this lower bar is the upper atmosphere, the stratosphere,
and it heats up after these volcanoes.
But you'll notice that in the upper bar, which is the lower atmosphere
and the surface, it cools down because we shielded the atmosphere a little bit.
There's no big mystery about it.
There's lots of mystery in the details, and there's some bad side effects,
like it partially destroys the ozone layer -- and I'll get to that in a minute.
But it clearly cools down.
And one other thing: it's fast.
It's really important to say. So much of the other things that we ought to do,
like slowing emissions, are intrinsically slow, because it takes time
to build all the hardware we need to reduce emissions.
And not only that, when you cut emissions, you don't cut concentrations,
because concentrations, the amount of CO2 in the air,
is the sum of emissions over time.
So you can't step on the brakes very quickly.
But if you do this, it's quick.
And there are times you might like to do something quick.
Can you shade some sunlight and effectively compensate for the added CO2,
and produce a climate sort of back to what it was originally?
And the answer seems to be yes.
So here are the graphs you've seen lots of times before.
That's what the world looks like, under one particular climate model's view,
with twice the amount of CO2 in the air.
The lower graph is with twice the amount of CO2 and 1.8 percent less sunlight,
and you're back to the original climate.
And this graph from Ken Caldeira. It's important to say came, because
Ken -- at a meeting that I believe Marty Hoffart was also at in the mid-'90s --
Ken and I stood up at the back of the meeting and said,
"Geo-engineering won't work."
And to the person who was promoting it said,
"The atmosphere's much more complicated."
Gave a bunch of physical reasons why it wouldn't do a very good compensation.
Ken went and ran his models, and found that it did.
That report that landed on President Johnson's desk when I was two years old --
1965.
That report, in fact, which had all the modern climate science --
the only thing they talked about doing was geo-engineering.
It didn't even talk about cutting emissions,
which is an incredible shift in our thinking about this problem.
I'm not saying we shouldn't cut emissions.
We should, but it made exactly this point.
So, in a sense, there's not much new.
The one new thing is this essay.
So I should say, I guess, that since the time of that original President Johnson report,
and the various reports of the U.S. National Academy --
1977, 1982, 1990 -- people always talked about this idea.
Not as something that was foolproof, but as an idea to think about.
in the last 15 years, this became so un-PC, we couldn't talk about it.
It just sunk below the surface. We weren't allowed to speak about it.
But in the last year, Paul Crutzen published this essay
saying roughly what's all been said before: that maybe, given our very slow rate
of progress in solving this problem and the uncertain impacts,
we should think about things like this.
He said roughly what's been said before.
The big deal was he happened to have won the Nobel prize for ozone chemistry.
And so people took him seriously when he said we should think about this,
even though there will be some ozone impacts.
And in fact, he had some ideas to make them go away.
going right down to "Dr. Strangelove Saves the Earth," from the Economist.
And that got me thinking. I've worked on this topic on and off,
but not so much technically. And I was actually lying in bed thinking one night.
And I thought about this child's toy -- hence, the title of my talk --
and I wondered if you could use the same physics that makes that thing spin 'round
in the child's radiometer, to levitate particles into the upper atmosphere
and make them stay there.
One of the problems with sulfates is they fall out quickly.
The other problem is they're right in the ozone layer,
and I'd prefer them above the ozone layer.
And it turns out, I woke up the next morning, and I started to calculate this.
It was very hard to calculate from first principles. I was stumped.
But then I found out that there were all sorts of papers already published
that addressed this topic because it happens already in the natural atmosphere.
So it seems there are already fine particles
that are levitated up to what we call the mesosphere, about 100 kilometers up,
that already have this effect.
There are a lot of fun complexities
that I'd love to spend the whole evening on, but I won't.
But let's say you have sunlight hitting some particle and it's unevenly heated.
So the side facing the sun is warmer; the side away, cooler.
Gas molecules that bounce off the warm side
bounce away with some extra velocity because it's warm.
And so you see a net force away from the sun.
That's called the photophoretic force.
There are a bunch of other versions of it that I and some collaborators
have thought about how to exploit.
And of course, we may be wrong --
this hasn't all been peer reviewed, we're in the middle of thinking about it --
but so far, it seems good.
But it looks like we could achieve long atmospheric lifetimes --
much longer than before -- because they're levitated.
We can move things out of the stratosphere into the mesosphere,
in principle solving the ozone problem.
I'm sure there will be other problems that arise.
Finally, we could make the particles migrate to over the poles,
so we could arrange the climate engineering so it really focused on the poles.
Which would have minimal bad impacts in the middle of the planet,
where we live, and do the maximum job of what we might need to do,
which is cooling the poles in case of planetary emergency, if you like.
a cleverer idea than putting sulfates in.
Whether this idea is right or some other idea is right,
I think it's almost certain we will
eventually think of cleverer things to do than just putting sulfur in.
That if engineers and scientists really turned their minds to this,
it's amazing how we can affect the planet.
The one thing about this is it gives us extraordinary leverage.
This improved science and engineering will, whether we like it or not,
give us more and more leverage to affect the planet,
to control the planet,
to give us weather and climate control -- not because we plan it,
not because we want it, just because science delivers it to us bit by bit,
with better knowledge of the way the system works
and better engineering tools to effect it.
Maybe they're going to land at the U.N. headquarters down the road here,
or maybe they'll pick a smarter spot --
but suppose they arrive and they give you a box.
And the box has two knobs.
One knob is the knob for controlling global temperature.
Maybe another knob is a knob for controlling CO2 concentrations.
You might imagine that we would fight wars over that box.
Because we have no way to agree about where to set the knobs.
We have no global governance.
And different people will have different places they want it set.
Now, I don't think that's going to happen. It's not very likely.
The scientists and engineers of the world
are building it piece by piece, in their labs.
Even when they're doing it for other reasons.
Even when they're thinking they're just working on protecting the environment.
They have no interest in crazy ideas like engineering the whole planet.
They develop science that makes it easier and easier to do.
And so I guess my view on this is not that I want to do it -- I do not --
but that we should move this out of the shadows and talk about it seriously.
Because sooner or later, we'll be confronted with decisions about this,
and it's better if we think hard about it,
even if we want to think hard about reasons why we should never do it.
of my thinking about how to think about it.
But what we need is not just a few oddballs like me thinking about this.
We need a broader debate.
A debate that involves musicians, scientists, philosophers, writers,
who get engaged with this question about climate engineering
and think seriously about what its implications are.
So here's one way to think about it,
which is that we just do this instead of cutting emissions because it's cheaper.
I guess the thing I haven't said about this is, it is absurdly cheap.
It's conceivable that, say, using the sulfates method or this method I've come up with,
you could create an ice age at a cost of .001 percent of GDP.
It's very cheap. We have a lot of leverage.
It's not a good idea, but it's just important. (Laughter)
I'll tell you how big the lever is: the lever is that big.
And that calculation isn't much in dispute.
You might argue about the sanity of it, but the leverage is real. (Laughter)
simply by stopping reducing emissions,
and just as the concentrations go up, we can increase
the amount of geo-engineering.
I don't think anybody takes that seriously.
Because under this scenario, we walk further and further away
from the current climate.
We have all sorts of other problems, like ocean acidification
that come from CO2 in the atmosphere, anyway.
Nobody but maybe one or two very odd folks really suggest this.
Let's say that we don't do geo-engineering, we do what we ought to do,
which is get serious about cutting emissions.
But we don't really know how quickly we have to cut them.
There's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much climate change is too much.
So let's say that we work hard, and we actually don't just tap the brakes,
but we step hard on the brakes and really reduce emissions
and eventually reduce concentrations.
And maybe someday -- like 2075, October 23 --
we finally reach that glorious day where concentrations have peaked
and are rolling down the other side.
And we have global celebrations, and we've actually started to -- you know,
we've seen the worst of it.
But maybe on that day we also find that the Greenland ice sheet
is really melting unacceptably fast, fast enough to put meters of sea level on
the oceans in the next 100 years,
and remove some of the biggest cities from the map.
That's an absolutely possible scenario.
We might decide at that point that even though geo-engineering was uncertain
and morally unhappy, that it's a lot better than not geo-engineering.
And that's a very different way to look at the problem.
It's using this as risk control, not instead of action.
It's saying that you do some geo-engineering for a little while
to take the worst of the heat off, not that you'd use it as a substitute for action.
And the problem is the following:
knowledge that geo-engineering is possible makes
the climate impacts look less fearsome,
and that makes a weaker commitment to cutting emissions today.
This is what economists call a moral hazard.
And that's one of the fundamental reasons that this problem is so hard to talk about,
and, in general, I think it's the underlying reason
that it's been politically unacceptable to talk about this.
But you don't make good policy by hiding things in a drawer.
Should we do serious research on this topic?
Should we have a national research program that looks at this?
Not just at how you would do it better,
but also what all the risks and downsides of it are.
Right now, you have a few enthusiasts talking about it, some in a positive side,
some in a negative side -- but that's a dangerous state to be in
because there's very little depth of knowledge on this topic.
A very small amount of money would get us some.
Many of us -- maybe now me -- think we should do that.
But I have a lot of reservations.
My reservations are principally about the moral hazard problem,
and I don't really know how we can best avoid the moral hazard.
I think there is a serious problem: as you talk about this,
people begin to think they don't need to work so hard to cut emissions.
A treaty that decides who gets to do this.
Right now we may think of a big, rich country like the U.S. doing this.
But it might well be that, in fact, if China wakes up in 2030 and realizes
that the climate impacts are just unacceptable,
they may not be very interested in our moral conversations about how to do this,
and they may just decide they'd really rather have a geo-engineered world
than a non-geo-engineered world.
And we'll have no international mechanism to figure out who makes the decision.
25 years ago in the U.S. National Academy report than I can say today.
And I think it really summarizes where we are here.
That the CO2 problem, the climate problem that we've heard about,
is driving lots of things -- innovations in the energy technologies
that will reduce emissions --
but also, I think, inevitably, it will drive us towards thinking about climate
and weather control, whether we like it or not.
And it's time to begin thinking about it,
even if the reason we're thinking about it is to construct arguments
for why we shouldn't do it.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.
You can mimic what you can see.
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.
I'm going to tell you about that technology.
the human brain, for thousands of years.
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.
People envision this as being very difficult.
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.
It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.
But now, we have a real technology to do this.
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there
is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.
the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.
and select brain areas to do that same thing.
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.
They're watching their own brain activation,
and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.
As they do it, in the upper left is a display
that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.
This is an investigational technology,
but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.
When you do, what do you want to control?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.
But I want to leave with you the big question.
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,
using this technology, the human mind and brain.
Where will we take it?
First place I'd like to take you
is what many believe will be the world's deepest natural abyss.
And I say believe because this process is still ongoing.
Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year
that I'll talk a little bit about.
in the last 150 years since Jules Verne
had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like,
is that technology has enabled us to go to these places
that were previously completely unknown and speculated about.
We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity.
Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large
that you can see for hundreds of meters
without a break in the line of sight.
When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field
for anywhere from two to four months,
with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150.
what kind of people do you get for a project like this?
While our selection process
is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough.
We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength.
In case you're wondering, this is our strength test.
(Laughter)
But we also value esprit de corps
and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict
while under great stress in remote locations.
From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave.
You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2.
We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point.
And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse,
except that you're now running a string of these things down.
The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort
while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places.
I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way,
is artificially illuminated at great effort.
Otherwise it is completely dark in these places.
It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down.
And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous
and unfortunately slides just don't do justice.
So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s.
So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico.
(Video)
Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here
are obsolete and dangerous.
We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film.
(Laughter)
that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year,
we have never seen monsters underground --
at least the kind that eat you.
If there is a monster underground,
it is the crushing psychological remoteness
that begins to hit every member of the team
once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance.
We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters --
that's a little over 8,600 feet down --
at 30 kilometers from the entrance.
The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight.
I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time.
probability says that you're going to run into a place like this.
It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum
that collects water and fills to the roof.
And when you used to find these things,
they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon.
Now I remember that term really well for two reasons.
Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second,
is because the confrontation of these things
forced me to become an inventor.
And we've since gone on to develop
many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this.
And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally
underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater.
When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA.
It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space,
but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril.
So it makes you think about how to design your equipment
for long range, away from a safe haven.
that came out in 1999.
of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before.
This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet.
To experience it is a privilege.
Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment
that you saw in there did not exist before 1999.
It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects.
This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper,
and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done
of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs.
It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door
to another unexplored world.
Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day.
This is one of the places where planetary scientists
believe there is a highest probability of the detection
of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there.
For those who have never seen this story,
Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie
couple of years ago, called "Aliens of the Deep."
There was a brief clip --
would be the ultimate robotic challenge.
Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light,
it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle.
It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards
and to find a good landing site on the ice.
Now we have to get through the ice.
You need a melt probe.
It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo.
The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep.
Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight
through the ancient ice, until finally --
Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean?
You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle.
It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate
and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean.
was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled
to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV.
I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design
and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX --
Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer.
And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy.
It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers,
100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code,
packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent.
the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico.
It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters
and beyond that nobody knows anything.
This is part of DEPTHX's mission.
One is, how do you do science autonomy underground?
How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist?
There are more stages involved here
than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive
through the space, we populate it with environmental variables --
sulphide, halide, things like that.
We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall
where there's a high probability of life.
We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations,
looking for changes in color.
If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope.
If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection.
We either draw in a liquid sample,
or we can actually take a solid core from the wall.
No hands at the wheel.
This is all behavioral autonomy here
that's being conducted by the robot on its own.
is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed,
known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping.
DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball.
Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time,
allowing it to do new exploration
while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock
on what it's gone through already.
is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground
that's ever been done.
This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton,
and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first
robotically-discovered division of bacteria.
The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then,
if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go,
we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019
we may have the first evidence of life off this planet.
The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024.
The successful conclusion of that mission will result
in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number
of government scientists and pilots.
It will leave us no further along in the general expansion
of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago.
Something fundamental has to change
if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime.
And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith
that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here.
There are three underpinnings of working in space privately.
One of them is the requirement
for economical earth-to-space transport.
The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world
have got this in their sights and I salute them.
Go, go, go.
Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on.
The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this:
a gas station on orbit.
It's not going to look like that.
If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning.
why there is power in that statement,
I've got to give you the basics of Space 101.
And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram.
Anybody drink one of these here this week?
You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit.
That's more than you pay for TED,
if Google dropped their sponsorship.
(Laughter)
The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant.
Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space,
you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money
every time you hit the accelerator.
Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics.
There is a place where you can.
In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower
if you can find propellant on the moon.
There is a little-known mission that was launched
by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine.
And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission
was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater
on the south pole of the moon.
That signal was so strong,
it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water
buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years
by the impact of asteroids and comet material.
we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space.
We can't do that right now.
The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack
that has to be launched from the ground,
and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces.
We have to beat that.
We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics.
We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything.
This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989,
with Dr. Lowell Wood's group.
And we can extend that now to just about everything.
Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit.
We can go much further.
We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water.
There's another thing.
When you're coming back from the moon,
you have to deal with orbital mechanics.
It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster
than you really want to be to get back to your gas station.
You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible.
You can dive into the stratosphere,
and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station.
It has never been done.
It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride --
better than Disney.
The traditional approach to space exploration
has been that you carry all the fuel you need
to get everybody back in case of an emergency.
If you try to do that for the moon,
you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there.
But if you send a mining team there,
without the return propellant, first --
(Laughter)
Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez?
This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty.
I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it
so we're not going to burn the gear.
But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it,
and it would be the most dramatic demonstration
that you could do something worthwhile off this planet
that has ever been done.
There's a myth that you can't do anything in space
for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years.
That's not true.
In seven years, we could pull off
an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate
that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit.
We're at a magical confluence where private wealth
and imagination are driving the demand for access to space.
The orbital refueling stations I've just described
could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key
for opening space to the general exploration.
To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed.
We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial
Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater,
to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate
they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit.
of purpose and timing.
I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED.
I intend to lead that expedition.
(Applause)
It can be done in seven years with the right backing.
Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history
and join other bold individuals from time past
who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved.
We have collectively forgotten that lesson.
Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward.
100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words,
I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon
and complete the final piece
that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us.
Thank you.
(Applause)
How does the news shape the way we see the world?
Here's the world based on the way it looks -- based on landmass.
And here's how news shapes what Americans see.
This map -- (Applause) -- this map shows the number of seconds
that American network and cable news organizations dedicated to news stories,
by country, in February of 2007 -- just one year ago.
Now, this was a month when North Korea agreed to dismantle its nuclear facilities.
There was massive flooding in Indonesia.
And in Paris, the IPCC released its study confirming man's impact on global warming.
The U.S. accounted for 79 percent of total news coverage.
And when we take out the U.S. and look at the remaining 21 percent,
we see a lot of Iraq -- that's that big green thing there -- and little else.
The combined coverage of Russia, China and India, for example, reached just one percent.
here's how the world looked.
What was that story? The death of Anna Nicole Smith.
This story eclipsed every country except Iraq,
and received 10 times the coverage of the IPCC report.
And the cycle continues;
as we all know, Britney has loomed pretty large lately.
One reason is that news networks have reduced the number of their foreign bureaus by half.
Aside from one-person ABC mini-bureaus in Nairobi, New Delhi and Mumbai,
there are no network news bureaus in all of Africa, India or South America
-- places that are home to more than two billion people.
And this lack of global coverage is all the more disturbing
when we see where people go for news.
Local TV news looms large,
and unfortunately only dedicates 12 percent of its coverage to international news.
The most popular news sites don't do much better.
Last year, Pew and the Colombia J-School analyzed the 14,000 stories
that appeared on Google News' front page.
And they, in fact, covered the same 24 news events.
Similarly, a study in e-content showed that much of global news from U.S. news creators
is recycled stories from the AP wire services and Reuters,
and don't put things into a context that people can understand their connection to it.
as well as less educated Americans,
know less about the world than their counterparts did 20 years ago.
And if you think it's simply because we are not interested,
you would be wrong.
In recent years, Americans who say they closely follow global news most of the time
grew to over 50 percent.
in our increasingly interconnected world?
I know we can do better.
And can we afford not to? Thank you.
(Applause)
I want to talk to you a little bit about user-generated content.
the United States Capitol, to talk about this technology,
what he called the, quote, "talking machines."
singing the songs of the day, or the old songs.
This is a picture of culture.
We could describe it using modern computer terminology
as a kind of read-write culture.
It's a culture where people participate in the creation
and the re-creation of their culture. In that sense, it's read-write.
Sousa's fear was that we would lose that capacity
because of these, quote, "infernal machines." They would take it away.
And in its place, we'd have the opposite of read-write culture,
what we could call read-only culture.
Culture where creativity was consumed
but the consumer is not a creator.
A culture which is top-down, owned,
where the vocal chords of the millions have been lost.
Never before in the history of human culture
had it been as professionalized, never before as concentrated.
Never before has creativity of the millions
been as effectively displaced,
and displaced because of these, quote, "infernal machines."
The twentieth century was that century
where, at least for those places we know the best,
culture moved from this read-write to read-only existence.
it is property. It's protected by law.
As Lord Blackstone described it, land is protected by trespass law,
for most of the history of trespass law,
by presuming it protects the land all the way down below
and to an indefinite extent upward.
Now, that was a pretty good system
for most of the history of the regulation of land,
until this technology came along, and people began to wonder,
were these instruments trespassers
as they flew over land without clearing the rights
of the farms below as they traveled across the country?
Well, in 1945, Supreme Court got a chance to address that question.
had a significant complaint because of these technologies.
The complaint was that their
chickens followed the pattern of the airplanes
and flew themselves into the walls of the barn
when the airplanes flew over the land.
And so they appealed to Lord Blackstone
to say these airplanes were trespassing.
Since time immemorial, the law had said,
you can't fly over the land without permission of the landowner,
so this flight must stop.
Well, the Supreme Court considered this 100-years tradition
and said, in an opinion written by Justice Douglas,
that the Causbys must lose.
The Supreme Court said the doctrine protecting land
Common sense, a rare idea in the law, but here it was. Common sense --
(Laughter) --
Revolts at the idea. Common sense.
to rain down on the content industry
was a terror created by this technology. Broadcasting:
a new way to spread content,
and therefore a new battle over the control
of the businesses that would spread content.
Now, at that time, the entity,
the legal cartel, that controlled the performance rights
for most of the music that would be broadcast
using these technologies was ASCAP.
They had an exclusive license on the most popular content,
So, between 1931 and 1939, they raised rates by some 448 percent,
until the broadcasters finally got together
and said, okay, enough of this.
And in 1939, a lawyer, Sydney Kaye, started something
called Broadcast Music Inc. We know it as BMI.
And BMI was much more democratic in the art
But most important was that BMI took public domain works
and made arrangements of them, which they gave away for free
to their subscribers. So that in 1940,
Now, ASCAP said they didn't care.
The people will revolt, they predicted, because the very best music
was no longer available, because they had shifted
to the second best public domain provided by BMI.
Well, they didn't revolt, and in 1941, ASCAP cracked.
were broadcasting something you would call second best,
that competition was enough to break, at that time,
this legal cartel over access to music.
about what this Internet is doing
is its opportunity to revive the read-write culture
that Sousa romanticized.
for the revival of these vocal chords
that he spoke so passionately to Congress about.
User-generated content, spreading in businesses
For when you think of what Sousa romanticized
in the young people together, singing the songs of the day,
You're every breath that I take ...
So, this is remix, right?
(Applause)
using other people's content, using digital technologies
is not the technique that you've seen here.
The importance is that that technique has been democratized.
that these activities are illegal.
And on the other side, among our kids,
there's a growing copyright abolitionism,
means that policymakers here will not understand this
until it's too late to fix it.
and that's where the story of BMI becomes relevant.
but not freely for any commercial use.
where they both exist simultaneously,
We can only drive it underground.
and that's what I -- we are doing to our kids.
Do better, at least for them, if not for opening for business.
Well, as Chris pointed out, I study the human brain,
the functions and structure of the human brain.
And I just want you to think for a minute about what this entails.
Here is this mass of jelly, three-pound mass of jelly
you can hold in the palm of your hand,
and it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity
and it can contemplate itself contemplating on the meaning of infinity.
And this peculiar recursive quality that we call self-awareness,
which I think is the holy grail of neuroscience, of neurology,
and hopefully, someday, we'll understand how that happens.
I mean, you have 100 billion nerve cells,
little wisps of protoplasm, interacting with each other,
and from this activity emerges the whole spectrum of abilities
that we call human nature and human consciousness.
How does this happen?
Well, there are many ways of approaching the functions of the human brain.
One approach, the one we use mainly,
is to look at patients with sustained damage to a small region of the brain,
where there's been a genetic change in a small region of the brain.
What then happens is not an across-the-board reduction
in all your mental capacities,
a sort of blunting of your cognitive ability.
What you get is a highly selective loss of one function,
with other functions being preserved intact,
and this gives you some confidence in asserting
that that part of the brain is somehow involved in mediating that function.
So you can then map function onto structure,
and then find out what the circuitry's doing
to generate that particular function.
So that's what we're trying to do.
In fact, I'm giving you three examples, six minutes each, during this talk.
The first example is an extraordinary syndrome called Capgras syndrome.
If you look at the first slide there,
that's the temporal lobes, frontal lobes, parietal lobes, OK --
the lobes that constitute the brain.
And if you look, tucked away inside the inner surface of the temporal lobes --
you can't see it there --
is a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
And that's been called the face area in the brain,
because when it's damaged, you can no longer recognize people's faces.
You can still recognize them from their voice
and say, "Oh yeah, that's Joe,"
but you can't look at their face and know who it is, right?
You can't even recognize yourself in the mirror.
I mean, you know it's you because you wink and it winks,
and you know it's a mirror,
but you don't really recognize yourself as yourself.
But there's another rare syndrome, so rare, in fact,
that very few physicians have heard about it, not even neurologists.
This is called the Capgras delusion,
and that is a patient, who's otherwise completely normal,
has had a head injury, comes out of coma,
otherwise completely normal, he looks at his mother
and says, "This looks exactly like my mother, this woman,
but she's an impostor.
She's some other woman pretending to be my mother."
Now, why does this happen?
Why would somebody -- and this person is perfectly lucid and intelligent
in all other respects, but when he sees his mother,
his delusion kicks in and says, it's not mother.
which you find in all the psychiatry textbooks,
is a Freudian view, and that is that this chap --
and the same argument applies to women, by the way,
but I'll just talk about guys.
When you're a little baby, a young baby,
you had a strong sexual attraction to your mother.
This is the so-called Oedipus complex of Freud.
I'm not saying I believe this,
but this is the standard Freudian view.
And then, as you grow up, the cortex develops,
and inhibits these latent sexual urges towards your mother.
Thank God, or you would all be sexually aroused when you saw your mother.
And then what happens is,
there's a blow to your head, damaging the cortex,
allowing these latent sexual urges to emerge,
flaming to the surface, and suddenly and inexplicably
you find yourself being sexually aroused by your mother.
And you say, "My God, if this is my mom,
how come I'm being sexually turned on?
She's some other woman. She's an impostor."
It's the only interpretation that makes sense to your damaged brain.
It's very ingenious, as all Freudian arguments are --
(Laughter)
-- but didn't make much sense because I have seen the same delusion,
a patient having the same delusion, about his pet poodle.
(Laughter)
He'll say, "Doctor, this is not Fifi. It looks exactly like Fifi,
but it's some other dog." Right?
Now, you try using the Freudian explanation there.
(Laughter)
You'll start talking about the latent bestiality in all humans,
or some such thing, which is quite absurd, of course.
So, to explain this curious disorder,
we look at the structure and functions of the normal visual pathways in the brain.
Normally, visual signals come in, into the eyeballs,
go to the visual areas in the brain.
There are, in fact, 30 areas in the back of your brain concerned with just vision,
and after processing all that, the message goes to a small structure
called the fusiform gyrus, where you perceive faces.
There are neurons there that are sensitive to faces.
You can call it the face area of the brain, right?
I talked about that earlier.
Now, when that area's damaged, you lose the ability to see faces, right?
into a structure called the amygdala in the limbic system,
the emotional core of the brain,
and that structure, called the amygdala,
gauges the emotional significance of what you're looking at.
Is it prey? Is it predator? Is it mate?
Or is it something absolutely trivial, like a piece of lint,
or a piece of chalk, or a -- I don't want to point to that, but --
or a shoe, or something like that? OK?
Which you can completely ignore.
So if the amygdala is excited, and this is something important,
the messages then cascade into the autonomic nervous system.
Your heart starts beating faster.
You start sweating to dissipate the heat that you're going to
create from muscular exertion.
And that's fortunate, because we can put two electrodes on your palm
and measure the change in skin resistance produced by sweating.
So I can determine, when you're looking at something,
whether you're excited or whether you're aroused, or not, OK?
And I'll get to that in a minute.
any object for that matter, it goes to the visual areas and,
however, and it's processed in the fusiform gyrus,
and you recognize it as a pea plant, or a table,
or your mother, for that matter, OK?
And then the message cascades into the amygdala,
and then goes down the autonomic nervous system.
But maybe, in this chap, that wire that goes from the amygdala to the limbic system,
the emotional core of the brain, is cut by the accident.
So because the fusiform is intact,
the chap can still recognize his mother,
and says, "Oh yeah, this looks like my mother."
But because the wire is cut to the emotional centers,
he says, "But how come, if it's my mother, I don't experience a warmth?"
Or terror, as the case may be? Right?
(Laughter)
And therefore, he says, "How do I account for this inexplicable lack of emotions?
This can't be my mother.
It's some strange woman pretending to be my mother."
Well, what you do is, if you take any one of you here, and put you in front of a screen,
and measure your galvanic skin response,
and show pictures on the screen,
I can measure how you sweat when you see an object,
like a table or an umbrella. Of course, you don't sweat.
If I show you a picture of a lion, or a tiger, or a pinup, you start sweating, right?
And, believe it or not, if I show you a picture of your mother --
I'm talking about normal people -- you start sweating.
You don't even have to be Jewish.
(Laughter)
You take the patient and show him pictures on the screen
and measure his galvanic skin response.
Tables and chairs and lint, nothing happens, as in normal people,
but when you show him a picture of his mother,
the galvanic skin response is flat.
There's no emotional reaction to his mother,
because that wire going from the visual areas to the emotional centers is cut.
So his vision is normal because the visual areas are normal,
his emotions are normal -- he'll laugh, he'll cry, so on and so forth --
but the wire from vision to emotions is cut
and therefore he has this delusion that his mother is an impostor.
It's a lovely example of the sort of thing we do:
take a bizarre, seemingly incomprehensible, neural psychiatric syndrome
and say that the standard Freudian view is wrong,
that, in fact, you can come up with a precise explanation
in terms of the known neural anatomy of the brain.
and mother phones from an adjacent room -- phones him --
and he picks up the phone, and he says, "Wow, mom, how are you? Where are you?"
There's no delusion through the phone.
Then, she approaches him after an hour, he says, "Who are you?
You look just like my mother." OK?
The reason is there's a separate pathway
going from the hearing centers in the brain to the emotional centers,
and that's not been cut by the accident.
So this explains why through the phone he recognizes his mother, no problem.
When he sees her in person, he says it's an impostor.
Is it nature, genes, or is it nurture?
And we approach this problem
by considering another curious syndrome called phantom limb.
And you all know what a phantom limb is.
When an arm is amputated, or a leg is amputated, for gangrene,
or you lose it in war -- for example, in the Iraq war,
it's now a serious problem --
you continue to vividly feel the presence of that missing arm,
and that's called a phantom arm or a phantom leg.
In fact, you can get a phantom with almost any part of the body.
Believe it or not, even with internal viscera.
I've had patients with the uterus removed -- hysterectomy --
who have a phantom uterus, including phantom menstrual cramps
at the appropriate time of the month.
And in fact, one student asked me the other day,
"Do they get phantom PMS?"
(Laughter)
A subject ripe for scientific enquiry, but we haven't pursued that.
what can you learn about phantom limbs by doing experiments?
One of the things we've found was,
about half the patients with phantom limbs
claim that they can move the phantom.
It'll pat his brother on the shoulder,
it'll answer the phone when it rings, it'll wave goodbye.
These are very compelling, vivid sensations.
The patient's not delusional.
He knows that the arm is not there,
but, nevertheless, it's a compelling sensory experience for the patient.
But however, about half the patients, this doesn't happen.
The phantom limb -- they'll say, "But doctor, the phantom limb is paralyzed.
It's fixed in a clenched spasm and it's excruciatingly painful.
If only I could move it, maybe the pain will be relieved."
It sounds like an oxymoron.
But when we were looking at the case sheets, what we found was,
these people with the paralyzed phantom limbs,
the original arm was paralyzed because of the peripheral nerve injury.
The actual nerve supplying the arm was severed,
was cut, by say, a motorcycle accident.
So the patient had an actual arm, which is painful,
in a sling for a few months or a year, and then,
in a misguided attempt to get rid of the pain in the arm,
the surgeon amputates the arm,
and then you get a phantom arm with the same pains, right?
And this is a serious clinical problem.
Patients become depressed.
Some of them are driven to suicide, OK?
Now, why do you get a paralyzed phantom limb?
When I looked at the case sheet, I found that they had an actual arm,
and the nerves supplying the arm had been cut,
and the actual arm had been paralyzed,
and lying in a sling for several months before the amputation,
and this pain then gets carried over into the phantom itself.
When the arm was intact, but paralyzed,
the brain sends commands to the arm, the front of the brain, saying, "Move,"
but it's getting visual feedback saying, "No."
Move. No. Move. No. Move. No.
And this gets wired into the circuitry of the brain,
and we call this learned paralysis, OK?
The brain learns, because of this Hebbian, associative link,
that the mere command to move the arm
creates a sensation of a paralyzed arm.
And then, when you've amputated the arm,
this learned paralysis carries over into your body image
and into your phantom, OK?
How do you unlearn the learned paralysis,
so you can relieve him of this excruciating, clenching spasm
of the phantom arm?
Well, we said, what if you now send the command to the phantom,
but give him visual feedback that it's obeying his command, right?
Maybe you can relieve the phantom pain, the phantom cramp.
How do you do that? Well, virtual reality.
But that costs millions of dollars.
So, I hit on a way of doing this for three dollars,
but don't tell my funding agencies.
(Laughter)
You have a cardboard box with a mirror in the middle,
and then you put the phantom -- so my first patient, Derek, came in.
He had his arm amputated 10 years ago.
He had a brachial avulsion, so the nerves were cut
and the arm was paralyzed, lying in a sling for a year, and then the arm was amputated.
He had a phantom arm, excruciatingly painful, and he couldn't move it.
It was a paralyzed phantom arm.
which I call a mirror box, right?
And the patient puts his phantom left arm,
which is clenched and in spasm, on the left side of the mirror,
and the normal hand on the right side of the mirror,
and makes the same posture, the clenched posture,
and looks inside the mirror. And what does he experience?
He looks at the phantom being resurrected,
because he's looking at the reflection of the normal arm in the mirror,
and it looks like this phantom has been resurrected.
"Now," I said, "now, look, wiggle your phantom --
your real fingers, or move your real fingers while looking in the mirror."
He's going to get the visual impression that the phantom is moving, right?
That's obvious, but the astonishing thing is,
the patient then says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again,
and the pain, the clenching spasm, is relieved."
(Applause)
-- thank you. (Applause)
My first patient came in, and he looked in the mirror,
and I said, "Look at your reflection of your phantom."
And he started giggling, he says, "I can see my phantom."
But he's not stupid. He knows it's not real.
He knows it's a mirror reflection,
but it's a vivid sensory experience.
Now, I said, "Move your normal hand and phantom."
He said, "Oh, I can't move my phantom. You know that. It's painful."
I said, "Move your normal hand."
And he says, "Oh my God, my phantom is moving again. I don't believe this!
And my pain is being relieved." OK?
And then I said, "Close your eyes."
He closes his eyes.
"And move your normal hand."
"Oh, nothing. It's clenched again."
"OK, open your eyes."
"Oh my God, oh my God, it's moving again!"
So, he was like a kid in a candy store.
and the critical role of visual input,
but I'm not going to get a Nobel Prize
for getting somebody to move his phantom limb.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's a completely useless ability, if you think about it.
(Laughter)
But then I started realizing, maybe other kinds of paralysis
that you see in neurology, like stroke, focal dystonias --
there may be a learned component to this,
which you can overcome with the simple device of using a mirror.
well, first of all, the guy can't just go around carrying a mirror to alleviate his pain --
I said, "Look, Derek, take it home and practice with it for a week or two.
Maybe, after a period of practice,
you can dispense with the mirror, unlearn the paralysis,
and start moving your paralyzed arm,
and then, relieve yourself of pain."
So he said OK, and he took it home.
I said, "Look, it's, after all, two dollars. Take it home."
and he said, "Doctor, you're not going to believe this."
I said, "What?"
He said, "It's gone."
I said, "What's gone?"
I thought maybe the mirror box was gone.
(Laughter)
He said, "No, no, no, you know this phantom I've had for the last 10 years?
It's disappeared."
And I said -- I got worried, I said, my God,
I mean I've changed this guy's body image,
what about human subjects, ethics and all of that?
And I said, "Derek, does this bother you?"
He said, "No, last three days, I've not had a phantom arm
and therefore no phantom elbow pain, no clenching,
no phantom forearm pain, all those pains are gone away.
But the problem is I still have my phantom fingers dangling from the shoulder,
and your box doesn't reach."
(Laughter)
"So, can you change the design and put it on my forehead,
so I can, you know, do this and eliminate my phantom fingers?"
He thought I was some kind of magician.
It's because the brain is faced with tremendous sensory conflict.
It's getting messages from vision saying the phantom is back.
On the other hand, there's no proprioception,
muscle signals saying that there is no arm, right?
And your motor command saying there is an arm,
and, because of this conflict, the brain says, to hell with it,
there is no phantom, there is no arm, right?
It goes into a sort of denial -- it gates the signals.
And when the arm disappears, the bonus is, the pain disappears
because you can't have disembodied pain floating out there, in space.
So, that's the bonus.
by other groups in Helsinki,
so it may prove to be valuable as a treatment for phantom pain,
and indeed, people have tried it for stroke rehabilitation.
Stroke you normally think of as damage to the fibers,
nothing you can do about it.
But, it turns out some component of stroke paralysis is also learned paralysis,
and maybe that component can be overcome using mirrors.
This has also gone through clinical trials,
helping lots and lots of patients.
which is about another curious phenomenon called synesthesia.
This was discovered by Francis Galton in the nineteenth century.
He was a cousin of Charles Darwin.
He pointed out that certain people in the population,
who are otherwise completely normal, had the following peculiarity:
every time they see a number, it's colored.
Five is blue, seven is yellow, eight is chartreuse,
nine is indigo, OK?
Bear in mind, these people are completely normal in other respects.
Or C sharp -- sometimes, tones evoke color.
C sharp is blue, F sharp is green,
another tone might be yellow, right?
This is called synesthesia. Galton called it synesthesia,
a mingling of the senses.
In us, all the senses are distinct.
These people muddle up their senses.
Why does this happen?
One of the two aspects of this problem are very intriguing.
Synesthesia runs in families,
so Galton said this is a hereditary basis, a genetic basis.
Secondly, synesthesia is about -- and this is what gets me to my point
about the main theme of this lecture, which is about creativity --
synesthesia is eight times more common among artists, poets, novelists
and other creative people than in the general population.
Why would that be?
I'm going to answer that question.
It's never been answered before.
Well, there are many theories.
One theory is they're just crazy.
Now, that's not really a scientific theory, so we can forget about it.
Another theory is they are acid junkies and potheads, right?
Now, there may be some truth to this,
because it's much more common here in the Bay Area than in San Diego.
(Laughter)
OK. Now, the third theory is that --
well, let's ask ourselves what's really going on in synesthesia. All right?
are right next to each other in the brain, in the fusiform gyrus.
So we said, there's some accidental cross wiring
between color and numbers in the brain.
So, every time you see a number, you see a corresponding color,
and that's why you get synesthesia.
Now remember -- why does this happen?
Why would there be crossed wires in some people?
Remember I said it runs in families?
That gives you the clue.
And that is, there is an abnormal gene,
a mutation in the gene that causes this abnormal cross wiring.
we are born with everything wired to everything else.
So, every brain region is wired to every other region,
and these are trimmed down to create
the characteristic modular architecture of the adult brain.
So, if there's a gene causing this trimming
and if that gene mutates,
then you get deficient trimming between adjacent brain areas.
And if it's between number and color, you get number-color synesthesia.
If it's between tone and color, you get tone-color synesthesia.
So far, so good.
so everything is cross-connected?
Well, think about what artists, novelists and poets have in common,
the ability to engage in metaphorical thinking,
linking seemingly unrelated ideas,
such as, "It is the east, and Juliet is the Sun."
Well, you don't say, Juliet is the sun,
does that mean she's a glowing ball of fire?
I mean, schizophrenics do that, but it's a different story, right?
Normal people say, she's warm like the sun,
she's radiant like the sun, she's nurturing like the sun.
Instantly, you've found the links.
and concepts are also in different parts of the brain,
then it's going to create a greater propensity
towards metaphorical thinking and creativity
in people with synesthesia.
And, hence, the eight times more common incidence of synesthesia
among poets, artists and novelists.
OK, it's a very phrenological view of synesthesia.
The last demonstration -- can I take one minute?
(Applause)
Here's what I call Martian alphabet. Just like your alphabet,
A is A, B is B, C is C.
Different shapes for different phonemes, right?
Here, you've got Martian alphabet.
One of them is Kiki, one of them is Bouba.
Which one is Kiki and which one is Bouba?
How many of you think that's Kiki and that's Bouba? Raise your hands.
Well, it's one or two mutants.
(Laughter)
How many of you think that's Bouba, that's Kiki? Raise your hands.
Ninety-nine percent of you.
It's because you're all doing a cross-model synesthetic abstraction,
meaning you're saying that that sharp inflection -- ki-ki,
in your auditory cortex, the hair cells being excited -- Kiki,
mimics the visual inflection, sudden inflection of that jagged shape.
Now, this is very important, because what it's telling you
is your brain is engaging in a primitive --
it's just -- it looks like a silly illusion,
but these photons in your eye are doing this shape,
and hair cells in your ear are exciting the auditory pattern,
but the brain is able to extract the common denominator.
It's a primitive form of abstraction,
and we now know this happens in the fusiform gyrus of the brain,
because when that's damaged,
these people lose the ability to engage in Bouba Kiki,
but they also lose the ability to engage in metaphor.
what does that mean?"
The patient says, "Well, if it's metallic and shiny, it doesn't mean it's gold.
You have to measure its specific gravity, OK?"
So, they completely miss the metaphorical meaning.
So, this area is about eight times the size in higher --
especially in humans -- as in lower primates.
Something very interesting is going on here in the angular gyrus,
because it's the crossroads between hearing, vision and touch,
and it became enormous in humans. And something very interesting is going on.
And I think it's a basis of many uniquely human abilities
like abstraction, metaphor and creativity.
All of these questions that philosophers have been studying for millennia,
we scientists can begin to explore by doing brain imaging,
and by studying patients and asking the right questions.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Sorry about that.
Being a child, and sort of crawling around the house,
I remember these Turkish carpets,
and there were these scenes, these battle scenes, these love scenes.
I mean, look, this animal is trying to fight back this spear
from this soldier.
And my mom took these pictures actually, last week,
of our carpets, and I remember this to this day.
There was another object, this sort of towering piece of furniture
with creatures and gargoyles and nudity --
pretty scary stuff, when you're a little kid.
so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work.
And then there was another influence.
I was a teenager, and at 15 or 16, I guess like all teenagers,
we want to just do what we love and what we believe in.
And so,
I fused together the two things I loved the most,
which was skiing and windsurfing.
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland.
I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there,
and some foot straps, and some metal fins,
and here I was, going really fast on frozen lakes.
It was really a death trap. I mean, it was incredible,
it worked incredibly well, but it was really dangerous.
And I realized then I had to go to design school.
(Laughter)
I mean, look at those graphics there.
(Laughter)
and it was the early '90s when I finished.
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley,
so I wanted to be there,
and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes,
that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes.
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy,
and we would get in to these meetings,
and these managers would come in,
and they would say,
"Well, what we're going to do here is really important, you know."
And they would give the projects code names, you know,
mostly from "Star Wars," actually: things like C3PO, Yoda, Luke.
So, in anticipation, I would be this young designer
in the back of the room, and I would raise my hand,
and I would ask questions.
I mean, in retrospect, probably stupid questions,
but things like, "What's this Caps Lock key for?"
or "What's this Num Lock key for?" You know, that thing?
"You know, do people really use it?
Do they need it? Do they want it in their homes?"
(Laughter)
the legacy stuff; they didn't want to change the insides.
They were really looking for us, the designers, to create the skins,
to put some pretty stuff outside of the box.
And I didn't want to be a colorist.
It wasn't what I wanted to do.
I didn't want to be a stylist in this way.
And then I saw this quote:
"advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal."
(Laughter)
and I started a little company, fuseproject.
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff.
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins,
but I wanted to work on the entire human experience.
And so the first projects were sort of humble,
but they took technology and maybe made it into things
that people would use in a new way,
and maybe finding some new functionality.
right when it launched,
and it's the first watch that has a display
that switches from horizontal to vertical.
And that allows me to check my timer discretely, here,
without bending my elbow.
And other projects, which were really about transformation,
about matching the human need.
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer,
and it ships completely flat,
and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot.
And something a little bit more experimental:
this is a light fixture for Swarovski,
and what it does is, it changes shape.
So, it goes from a circle, to a round, to a square, to a figure eight.
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet,
the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want.
This is a pretty involved process;
it took us about four and a half years.
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light,
a new experience of light.
So, we had to design both the light and the light bulb.
And that's a unique opportunity, I would say, in design.
And the new experience I was looking for
is giving the choice for the user to go from
a warm, sort of glowing kind of mood light,
all the way to a bright work light.
So, the light bulb actually does that.
It allows the person to switch,
and to mix these two colorations.
And it's done in a very simple way:
one just touches the base of the light,
and on one side, you can mix the brightness,
and on the other, the coloration of the light.
and I think as designers we need to really think
about how we can create a different relationship
between our work and the world,
whether it's for business,
or, as I'm going to show, on some civic-type projects.
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring
value to business, value to the users also,
but I think it's the values that we put into these projects
that ultimately create the greater value.
And the values we bring
can be about environmental issues,
about sustainability, about lower power consumption.
You know, they can be about function and beauty;
they can be about business strategy.
But designers are really the glue
that brings these things together.
and it has a humanistic technology.
It feels your skin. It rests on your skin,
and it knows when it is you're talking.
And by knowing when it is you're talking,
it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about,
which is the environmental noises.
is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff,
and all the nerdy stuff out of it,
and try to make it as beautiful as we can.
I mean, think about it:
the care we take in selecting sunglasses, or jewelry,
or accessories is really important,
so if it isn't beautiful, it really doesn't belong on your face.
And this is what we're pursuing here.
I want to point at something here, on the left.
This is the board, this is one of the things that goes inside
that makes this technology work.
But this is the design process:
there's somebody changing the board,
putting tracers on the board, changing the location of the ICs,
as the designers on the other side are doing the work.
So, it's not about slapping skins, anymore, on a technology.
It's really about designing from the inside out.
And then, on the other side of the room,
the designers are making small adjustments,
sketching, drawing by hand, putting it in the computer.
And it's what I call being design driven.
You know, there is some push and pull,
but design is really helping define
the whole experience from the inside out.
And this is -- the other new way that is unique
in how we work is, because it's never done,
you have to do all this other stuff.
The packaging, and the website, and you need to continue
to really touch the user, in many ways.
But how do you retain somebody, when it's never done?
And Hosain Rahman, the CEO of Aliph Jawbone,
you know, really understands that you need a different structure.
So, in a way, the different structure is that we're partners,
it's a partnership. We can continue to work
and dedicate ourselves to this project,
and then we also share in the rewards.
This is called Y Water,
and it's this guy from Los Angeles, Thomas Arndt,
Austrian originally, who came to us,
and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink,
or an organic drink for his kids,
to replace the high-sugar-content sodas
that he's trying to get them away from.
So, we worked on this bottle,
and it's completely symmetrical in every dimension.
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game.
The bottles connect together,
and you can create different shapes, different forms.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you.
(Applause)
the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y,
and then we thought, well these words, "why" and "why not,"
are probably the most important words that kids ask.
So we called it Y Water. And so this is
another place where it all comes together in the same room:
the three-dimensional design, the ideas, the branding,
it all becomes deeply connected.
And then the other thing about this project is,
we bring intellectual property,
we bring a marketing approach,
we bring all this stuff, but I think, at the end of the day,
what we bring is these values,
and these values create a soul for the companies we work with.
And it's especially rewarding when your design work
becomes a creative endeavor,
when others can be creative and do more with it.
which I think really emulates that.
This is the One Laptop per Child, the $100 laptop.
This picture is incredible.
In Nigeria, people carry their most precious belongings on their heads.
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head.
I mean, to me, it just means so much.
But when Nicholas Negroponte --
and he has spoken about this project a lot,
he's the founder of OLPC -- came to us
about two and a half years ago,
there were some clear ideas.
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology,
and those are pillars of his life,
but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child.
But the third pillar that he talked about was design.
And at the time, I wasn't really working on computers.
I didn't really want to, from the previous adventure.
But what he said was really significant,
is that design was going to be why the kids
were going to love this product,
how we were going to make it low cost, robust.
And plus, he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key --
(Laughter) --
and the Num Lock key, too.
to look different. To look like it's for a kid, but not like a toy.
And then the integration of
all these great technologies, which you've heard about,
the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect;
the screen, which you can read in sunlight;
the keyboard, which is made out of rubber,
and it's protected from the environment.
because of the passion and
the OLPC people and the engineers.
They fought the suppliers,
they fought the manufacturers.
I mean, they fought like animals
for this to remain they way it is.
And in a way, it is that will that makes projects like this one --
allows the process
from not destroying the original idea.
And I think this is something really important.
you get up in the morning, and you see the kids in Nigeria
and you see them in Uruguay
with their computers, and in Mongolia.
And we went away from obviously the beige.
I mean it's colorful, it's fun.
In fact, you can see each logo is a little bit different.
It's because we were able
to run, during the manufacturing process,
20 colors for the X and the O,
which is the name of the computer,
and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor,
you get 20 times 20: you get
400 different options there.
So, the lessons from seeing the kids
using them in the developing world are incredible.
and he had the laptop for an afternoon,
and I had to take it back. It was hard.
(Laughter)
And it was a prototype. And a month and a half later,
I come back to Switzerland,
and there he is playing with his own version.
(Laughter)
Like paper, paper and cardboard.
and this is a little bit more of adult play.
(Laughter)
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom.
It's actually just launched, actually launched on Valentine's Day,
February 14, about 10 days ago.
So, the Department of Health in New York came to us,
and they needed a way to distribute
36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York.
So a pretty big endeavor, and we worked on the dispensers.
These are the dispensers. There's this friendly shape.
It's a little bit like designing a fire hydrant,
and it has to be easily serviceable:
you have to know where it is and what it does.
And we also designed the condoms themselves.
and I went to see all these places where they're installed:
this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store;
at a bar in Christopher Street; at a pool hall.
I mean, they're being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere.
Of course, clubs and discos, too.
And here's the public service announcement for this project.
(Music)
(Laughter)
Get some.
(Applause)
is able to create a conversation.
I was in these venues, and people were,
you know, really into getting them. They were excited.
It was breaking the ice,
it was getting over a stigma,
and I think that's also what design can do.
So, I was going to
throw some condoms in the room and whatnot,
but I'm not sure it's the etiquette here.
(Laughter)
Yeah? All right, all right. I have only a few.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So, I have more, you can always ask me for some more later.
(Laughter)
And if anybody asks why you're carrying a condom,
you can just say you like the design.
(Laughter)
if we all work together on creating value,
but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do,
I think we can change the work that we do.
We can change these values, can change the companies we work with,
and eventually, together, maybe we can change the world.
So, thank you.
(Applause)
We are going to talk today about the sequel of "Inconvenient Truth."
It's time again to talk about "Inconvenient Truth,"
a truth that everyone is concerned about,
but nobody is willing to talk about.
Somebody has to take the lead, and I decided to do it.
If you are scared by global warming,
wait until we learn about local warming.
We will talk today about local warming.
especially if you are a male.
This message is given as a public service.
Blogging affects your posture. We start with the posture.
This is the posture of ladies who are not blogging;
this is the posture of ladies who are blogging.
(Laughter)
This is the natural posture of a man sitting,
squatting for ventilation purposes.
(Laughter)
And this is the natural posture of a standing man,
and I think this picture inspired Chris to insert me
into the lateral thinking session.
This is male blogging posture sitting, and the result is,
"For greater comfort,
men naturally sit with their legs farther apart than women,
when working on laptop.
However, they will adopt a less natural posture
in order to balance it on their laps,
which resulted in a significant rise of body heat
between their thighs." This is the issue of local warming.
(Laughter)
very serious. This is a very --
(Laughter)
-- gentlemen and ladies, be serious.
This is a very serious research, that you should read the underline.
And be careful, your genes are in danger.
Will geeks become endangered species?
The fact: population growth in countries with high laptop --
(Laughter)
I need Hans Rosling to give me a graph.
(Applause)
Global warming fun.
(Laughter)
But let's keep things in proportion.
first of all, you can use natural ventilation. You can use body breath.
You should stay cool with the appropriate clothing.
You should care about your posture -- this is not right.
Can you extract from Chris another minute and a half for me,
because I have a video I have to show you.
(Applause)
Another benefit of Wi-Fi, we learned yesterday about the benefits of Wi-Fi.
Wi-Fi enables you to avoid the processor. And there are some enhanced
protection measures, which I would like to share with you,
and I would like, in a minute, to thank Philips for helping.
This is a research which was done in '86, but it's still valid.
Scrotal temperature reflects intratesticular temperature
and is lowered by shaving.
I didn't know what is scrotal; I understand it's a scrotum.
I guess in plural it's scrotal, like medium and media.
Digital scrotum, digital media.
And only last year I recognized that I'm a proud scrotum owner.
(Laughter)
so you can see that your tax man is working for good causes.

And so does your [bleep]. These days, with a hair-free back,

(Applause)
-- for this gesture for humanity.
And this is how they are promoting the product. This is --
I didn't touch it, this is original.

there are some secondary uses.

And this is what the young generation says.

And I just want to show you that I'm not just preaching,
but I also practice.

Any lady, any lady? Thank you very much.
(Applause)
and the imagination -- the imagination as we know it --
and, infused with consciousness, began a journey that would carry it
to every corner of the habitable world.
we quickly left Neanderthal gasping for survival.
By the time the last Neanderthal disappeared in Europe,
27,000 years ago,
our direct ancestors had already,
and for 5,000 years,
been crawling into the belly of the earth,
the great art of the Upper Paleolithic.
with the poet Clayton Eshleman, who wrote a beautiful book called "Juniper Fuse."
And you could look at this art and you could, of course,
see the complex social organization
that had been irrevocably lost.
So, he saw this art not as
And viewed in that light,
it takes on a whole other resonance.
is that as an aesthetic expression,
it lasted for almost 20,000 years.
If these were postcards of nostalgia,
And it was also the beginning of our discontent,
because if you wanted to distill all of our experience
since the Paleolithic, it would come down to two words:
how and why.
And these are the slivers of insight upon which cultures have been forged.
Now, all people share the same
raw, adaptive imperatives.
We all have children.
We all have to deal with the mystery of death,
the world that waits beyond death,
the elders who fall away into their elderly years.
All of this is part of our common experience,
and this shouldn't surprise us, because, after all,
biologists have finally proven it to be true,
something that philosophers have always dreamt to be true.
And that is the fact that we are all brothers and sisters.
We are all cut from the same genetic cloth.
All of humanity, probably, is descended from a thousand people
who left Africa roughly 70,000 years ago.
if we all are brothers and sisters
and share the same genetic material,
all human populations share the same raw human genius,
the same intellectual acuity.
And so whether that genius is placed
into -- technological wizardry
has been the great achievement of the West --
or by contrast, into unraveling the complex threads
of memory inherent in a myth,
is simply a matter of choice and cultural orientation.
There is no progression of affairs
in human experience.
There is no trajectory of progress. There's no pyramid
that conveniently places Victorian England at the apex
and descends down the flanks
to the so-called primitives of the world.
All peoples are simply cultural options,
different visions of life itself.
But what do I mean by different visions of life
making for completely different
possibilities for existence?
ever brought into being by the imagination,
that of Polynesia.
10,000 square kilometers,
tens of thousands of islands flung like jewels upon the southern sea.
I recently sailed on the Hokulea,
named after the sacred star of Hawaii,
throughout the South Pacific to make a film
about the navigators.
These are men and women who, even today, can name
250 stars in the night sky.
These are men and women who can sense the presence of distant atolls
of islands beyond the visible horizon,
simply by watching the reverberation of waves
across the hull of their vessel, knowing full well
that every island group in the Pacific
has its unique refractive pattern
that can be read with the same perspicacity
with which a forensic scientist would read a fingerprint.
These are sailors who in the darkness, in the hull of the vessel,
can distinguish as many as 32 different sea swells
moving through the canoe at any one point in time,
distinguishing local wave disturbances
from the great currents that pulsate across the ocean,
that can be followed with the same ease
that a terrestrial explorer would follow a river to the sea.
Indeed, if you took all of the genius
that allowed us to put a man on the moon
and applied it to an understanding of the ocean,
what you would get is Polynesia.
into the realm of the spirit of the imagination,
you enter the realm of Tibetan Buddhism.
And I recently made a film called "The Buddhist Science of the Mind."
Why did we use that word, science?
What is science but the empirical pursuit of the truth?
What is Buddhism but 2,500 years
of empirical observation
as to the nature of mind?
I travelled for a month in Nepal with our good friend, Matthieu Ricard,
and you'll remember Matthieu famously said to all of us
here once at TED,
"Western science is a major response to minor needs."
We spend all of our lifetime trying to live to be 100
without losing our teeth.
The Buddhist spends all their lifetime trying to understand the nature of existence.
Their billboards are manuals,
prayers to the well-being of all sentient creatures.
And with the blessing of Trulshik Rinpoche, we began a pilgrimage
to a curious destination,
accompanied by a great doctor.
And the destination was a single room in a nunnery,
where a woman had gone into lifelong retreat
55 years before.
And en route, we took darshan from Rinpoche,
and he sat with us and told us about the Four Noble Truths,
the essence of the Buddhist path.
All life is suffering. That doesn't mean all life is negative.
It means things happen.
The cause of suffering is ignorance.
By that, the Buddha did not mean stupidity;
he meant clinging to the illusion
that life is static and predictable.
The third noble truth said that ignorance can be overcome.
And the fourth and most important, of course,
was the delineation of a contemplative practice
that not only had the possibility
of a transformation of the human heart,
but had 2,500 years of empirical evidence
that such a transformation was a certainty.
who had not been out of that room in 55 years,
you did not see a mad woman.
You saw a woman who was more clear
than a pool of water in a mountain stream.
And of course, this is what the Tibetan monks told us.
They said, at one point, you know, we don't really believe
you went to the moon, but you did.
You may not believe that we achieve enlightenment
in one lifetime, but we do.
And if we move from the realm of the spirit
to the realm of the physical,
to the sacred geography of Peru --
I've always been interested in the relationships of indigenous people
that literally believe that the Earth is alive,
responsive to all of their aspirations,
all of their needs.
And, of course, the human population
has its own reciprocal obligations.
the people of Chinchero
and I always heard about an event that I always wanted to participate in.
Once each year, the fastest young boy
in each hamlet is given the honor of becoming a woman.
And for one day, he wears the clothing of his sister
and he becomes a transvestite,
a waylaka. And for that day,
he leads all able-bodied men on a run,
but it's not your ordinary run.
You start off at 11,500 feet.
You run down to the base of the sacred mountain, Antakillqa.
You run up to 15,000 feet,
descend 3,000 feet.
Climb again over the course of 24 hours.
And of course, the waylakama spin,
the trajectory of the route,
is marked by holy mounds of Earth,
where coke is given to the Earth, libations of alcohol to the wind,
the vortex of the feminine is brought to the mountaintop.
And the metaphor is clear: you go into the mountain as an individual,
but through exhaustion, through sacrifice,
you emerge as a community that has once again
reaffirmed its sense of place in the planet.
And at 48, I was the only outsider ever to go through this,
only one to finish it.
I only managed to do it by chewing more coca leaves in one day
than anyone in the 4,000-year history of the plant.
like that of the Qoyllur Rit'i, which occurs
when the Pleiades reappear in the winter sky.
It's kind of like an Andean Woodstock:
60,000 Indians on pilgrimage
to the end of a dirt road
that leads to the sacred valley, called the Sinakara,
which is dominated by three tongues
of the great glacier.
The metaphor is so clear. You bring the crosses from your community,
in this wonderful fusion of Christian
and pre-Columbian ideas.
You place the cross into the ice,
in the shadow of Ausangate, the most sacred of all Apus,
or sacred mountains of the Inca.
And then you do the ritual dances that empower the crosses.
allow us even to deconstruct iconic places
that many of you have been to, like Machu Picchu.
Machu Picchu was never a lost city.
On the contrary, it was completely linked in
to the 14,000 kilometers of royal roads
the Inca made in less than a century.
But more importantly, it was linked in
to the Andean notions of sacred geography.
The intiwatana, the hitching post to the sun,
is actually an obelisk that constantly reflects the light
that falls on the sacred Apu of Machu Picchu,
which is Sugarloaf Mountain, called Huayna Picchu.
If you come to the south of the intiwatana, you find an altar.
Climb Huayna Picchu, find another altar.
Take a direct north-south bearing,
you find to your astonishment
that it bisects the intiwatana stone,
goes to the skyline,
hits the heart of Salcantay, the second of the most important mountains
of the Incan empire.
And then beyond Salcantay, of course,
when the southern cross reaches the southernmost point in the sky,
directly in that same alignment, the Milky Way overhead.
But what is enveloping Machu Picchu from below?
The sacred river, the Urubamba, or the Vilcanota,
which is itself the Earthly equivalent of the Milky Way,
but it's also the trajectory that Viracocha walked
at the dawn of time when he brought the universe into being.
And where does the river rise?
Right on the slopes of the Koariti.
these ancient rhythms of landscape
are played out in ritual.
Now, when I was here at the first TED,
I showed this photograph: two men of the Elder Brothers,
the descendants, survivors of El Dorado.
These, of course, are the descendants
of the ancient Tairona civilization.
If those of you who are here remember that I mentioned
that they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood,
but the training for the priesthood is extraordinary.
Taken from their families, sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
for 18 years -- two nine-year periods deliberately chosen
to evoke the nine months they spend in the natural mother's womb.
All that time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
as they are taught the values of their society.
Values that maintain the proposition that their prayers,
and their prayers alone, maintain the cosmic balance.
Now, the measure of a society is not only what it does,
but the quality of its aspirations.
to see if this could possibly be true,
as indeed had been reported by the great anthropologist,
Reichel-Dolmatoff.
So, literally two weeks ago,
I returned from having spent six weeks with the Elder Brothers
on what was clearly the most
extraordinary trip of my life.
These really are a people who live and breathe
the realm of the sacred,
a baroque religiosity that is simply awesome.
They consume more coca leaves than any human population,
half a pound per man, per day.
The gourd you see here is --
everything in their lives is symbolic.
Their central metaphor is a loom.
They say, "Upon this loom, I weave my life."
They refer to the movements as they exploit the ecological niches of the gradient
as "threads."
When they pray for the dead, they make these gestures with their hands,
spinning their thoughts into the heavens.
The gourd is a feminine aspect; the stick is a male.
You put the stick in the powder
to take the sacred ashes -- well, they're not ashes,
they're burnt limestone --
to empower the coca leaf, to change
the pH of the mouth to facilitate the absorption
of cocaine hydrochloride.
But if you break a gourd, you cannot simply throw it away,
because every stroke of that stick
that has built up that calcium,
the measure of a man's life,
has a thought behind it.
Fields are planted in such an extraordinary way,
that the one side of the field
is planted like that by the women.
The other side is planted like that by the men. Metaphorically,
you turn it on the side, and you have a piece of cloth.
And they are the descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization,
the greatest goldsmiths of South America,
who in the wake of the conquest,
retreated into this isolated volcanic massif
that soars to 20,000 feet
above the Caribbean coastal plain.
the Kogi, the Wiwa, the Kankwano and the Arhuacos.
I traveled with the Arhuacos,
and the wonderful thing about this story
was that this man, Danilo Villafane --
if we just jump back here for a second.
When I first met Danilo, in the Colombian embassy in Washington,
I couldn't help but say, "You know,
you look a lot like an old friend of mine."
Well, it turns out he was the son of my friend, Adalberto,
from 1974, who had been killed by the FARC.
And I said, "Danilo, you won't remember this,
but when you were an infant, I carried you on my back,
up and down the mountains."
And because of that, Danilo invited us
to go to the very heart of the world,
a place where no journalist had ever been permitted.
Not simply to the flanks of the mountains,
but to the very iced peaks which are the destiny of the pilgrims.
is now a grown-up Eugenio,
a man who I've known since 1974.
And this is one of those initiates.
No, it's not true that they're kept in the darkness for 18 years,
but they are kept within the confines
of the ceremonial men's circle
for 18 years.
This little boy will never step outside
of the sacred fields
that surround the men's hut for all that time,
until he begins his journey of initiation.
For that entire time, the world only exists as an abstraction,
as he is taught the values of society,
including this notion that their prayers alone
maintain the cosmic balance.
Before we could begin our journey,
we had to be cleansed at the portal of the Earth.
And it was extraordinary to be taken by a priest.
And you see that the priest never wears shoes because holy feet --
there must be nothing between the feet
and the Earth for a mamo.
And this is actually the place where the Great Mother
sent the spindle into the world
that elevated the mountains and created the homeland
that they call the heart of the world.
and as we crested the hills,
we realized that the men were interpreting
every single bump on the landscape
in terms of their own intense religiosity.
And then of course, as we reached our final destination,
a place called Mamancana,
we were in for a surprise,
because the FARC were waiting to kidnap us.
And so we ended up being taken aside into these huts,
hidden away until the darkness.
And then, abandoning all our gear,
we were forced to ride out in the middle of the night,
in a quite dramatic scene.
It's going to look like a John Ford Western.
And we ran into a FARC patrol at dawn, so it was quite harrowing.
It will be a very interesting film. But what was fascinating
is that the minute there was a sense of dangers,
the mamos went into a circle of divination.
literally taken the night we were in hiding,
as they divine their route
to take us out of the mountains.
We were able to, because we had trained
people in filmmaking,
continue with our work,
and send our Wiwa and Arhuaco filmmakers
to the final sacred lakes
to get the last shots for the film,
and we followed the rest of the Arhuaco back to the sea,
taking the elements from the highlands to the sea.
And here you see how their sacred landscape
has been covered by brothels and hotels and casinos,
and yet, still they pray.
And it's an amazing thing to think
that this close to Miami,
two hours from Miami, there is an entire civilization of people
praying every day for your well-being.
They call themselves the Elder Brothers.
They dismiss the rest of us who have ruined the world
as the Younger Brothers. They cannot understand
why it is that we do what we do to the Earth.
I was up in the high Arctic
to tell a story about global warming,
inspired in part by
the former Vice President's wonderful book.
And what struck me so extraordinary
was to be again with the Inuit --
a people who don't fear the cold, but take advantage of it.
A people who
find a way, with their imagination,
to carve life out of that very frozen.
A people for whom blood on ice
is not a sign of death, but an affirmation of life.
And yet tragically, when you now go to those northern communities,
you find to your astonishment
that whereas the sea ice used to come in in September
and stay till July,
in a place like Kanak in northern Greenland,
it literally comes in now in November
and stays until March.
So, their entire year has been cut in half.
that I've been quickly talking about here
are disappearing worlds.
These are not dying peoples.
On the contrary, you know,
if you have the heart to feel and the eyes to see,
you discover that the world is not flat.
The world remains a rich tapestry.
It remains a rich topography of the spirit.
These myriad voices of humanity
are not failed attempts at being new,
failed attempts at being modern.
They're unique facets of the human imagination.
They're unique answers to a fundamental question:
what does it mean to be human and alive?
And when asked that question, they respond
with 6,000 different voices.
And collectively, those voices become our human repertoire
for dealing with the challenges that will confront us
in the ensuing millennia.
300 years old.
That shallow history shouldn't suggest to anyone
that we have all of the answers
for all of the questions that will confront us
in the ensuing millennia.
The myriad voices of humanity are not failed attempts at being us.
They are unique answers to that fundamental question:
what does it mean to be human and alive?
And there is indeed a fire burning over the Earth,
taking with it not only plants and animals,
but the legacy of humanity's brilliance.
of those 6,000 languages spoken the day that you were born,
fully half aren't being taught to children.
So, you're living through a time
when virtually half of humanity's intellectual,
social and spiritual legacy
is being allowed to slip away.
This does not have to happen.
These peoples are not failed attempts at being modern --
quaint and colorful and destined to fade away
as if by natural law.
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces.
That's actually an optimistic observation,
because it suggests that if human beings
are the agents of cultural destruction,
we can also be, and must be,
the facilitators of cultural survival.
The first idea I'd like to suggest is that we all
love music a great deal. It means a lot to us.
But music is even more powerful if you don't just listen to it, but you make it yourself.
So, that's my first idea. And we all know about the Mozart effect --
the idea that's been around for the last five to 10 years --
that just by listening to music or by playing music to your baby [in utero],
that it'll raise our IQ points 10, 20, 30 percent.
So, you can't just listen to music, you have to make it somehow.
And I'd add to that, that it's not just making it,
but everybody, each of us, everybody in the world
has the power to create and be part of music in a very dynamic way,
and that's one of the main parts of my work.
So, with the MIT Media Lab, for quite a while now,
we've been engaged in a field called active music.
What are all the possible ways that we can think of
to get everybody in the middle of a musical experience,
not just listening, but making music?
we call these hyperinstruments -- for Yo-Yo Ma, Peter Gabriel, Prince,
orchestras, rock bands. Instruments where they're all kinds of sensors
built right into the instrument, so the instrument knows how it's being played.
And just by changing the interpretation and the feeling,
I can turn my cello into a voice, or into a whole orchestra,
or into something that nobody has ever heard before.
wonderful instruments like that for everybody,
people who aren't fantastic Yo-Yo Mas or Princes?
So, we've made a whole series of instruments.
One of the largest collections is called the Brain Opera.
It's a whole orchestra of about 100 instruments,
all designed for anybody to play using natural skill.
So, you can play a video game, drive through a piece of music,
use your body gesture to control huge masses of sound,
touch a special surface to make melodies, use your voice to make a whole aura.
And when we make the Brain Opera, we invite the public to come in,
to try these instruments and then collaborate with us
to help make each performance of the Brain Opera.
We toured that for a long time. It is now permanently in Vienna,
where we built a museum around it.
Guitar Hero came out of our lab,
and my two teenage daughters and most of the students at the MIT Media Lab
are proof that if you make the right kind of interface,
people are really interested in being in the middle of a piece of music,
and playing it over and over and over again.
because my second idea is that it's not enough just to want
to make music in something like Guitar Hero.
And music is very fun, but it's also transformative.
It's very, very important.
Music can change your life, more than almost anything.
It can change the way you communicate with others,
it can change your body, it can change your mind. So, we're trying
to go to the next step of how you build on top of something like Guitar Hero.
We are very involved in education. We have a long-term project
called Toy Symphony, where we make all kinds of instruments that are also addictive,
but for little kids, so the kids will fall in love with making music,
want to spend their time doing it, and then will demand to know how it works,
how to make more, how to create. So, we make squeezy instruments,
like these Music Shapers that measure the electricity in your fingers,
Beatbugs that let you tap in rhythms -- they gather your rhythm,
and like hot potato, you send your rhythm to your friends,
who then have to imitate or respond to what your doing --
and a software package called Hyperscore, which lets anybody use lines and color
to make quite sophisticated music. Extremely easy to use, but once you use it,
you can go quite deep -- music in any style. And then, by pressing a button,
it turns into music notation so that live musicians can play your pieces.
around the world, and now people of all ages, using Hyperscore.
So, we've gotten more and more interested in using these kinds of creative activities
in a much broader context, for all kinds of people
who don't usually have the opportunity to make music.
So, one of the growing fields that we're working on
at the Media Lab right now is music, mind and health.
A lot of you have probably seen Oliver Sacks' wonderful new book called
"Musicophilia". It's on sale in the bookstore. It's a great book.
If you haven't seen it, it's worth reading. He's a pianist himself,
and he details his whole career of looking at and observing
incredibly powerful effects that music has had on peoples' lives in unusual situations.
that people with advanced Alzheimer's can still respond to.
Maybe many of you have noticed this with loved ones,
you can find somebody who can't recognize their face in the mirror,
or can't tell anyone in their family, but you can still find a shard of music
that that person will jump out of the chair and start singing. And with that
you can bring back parts of people's memories and personalities.
Music is the best way to restore speech to people who have lost it through strokes,
movement to people with Parkinson's disease.
It's very powerful for depression, schizophrenia, many, many things.
and then building activities which will let music really improve people's health.
And we do this in many ways. We work with many different hospitals.
One of them is right near Boston, called Tewksbury Hospital.
It's a long-term state hospital, where several years ago
we started working with Hyperscore and patients with physical and mental disabilities.
This has become a central part of the treatment at Tewksbury hospital,
so everybody there clamors to work on musical activities.
It's the activity that seems to accelerate people's treatment the most
and it also brings the entire hospital together as a kind of musical community.
I wanted to show you a quick video of some of this work before I go on.
Video: They're manipulating each other's rhythms.
It's a real experience, not only to learn how to play and listen to rhythms,
but to train your musical memory and playing music in a group.
To get their hands on music, to shape it themselves, change it,
to experiment with it, to make their own music.
So Hyperscore lets you start from scratch very quickly.
Everybody can experience music in a profound way,
we just have to make different tools.
I think even more than words, is one of the very best ways we have
of showing who we really are. I love giving talks, although
strangely I feel more nervous giving talks than playing music.
If I were here playing cello, or playing on a synth, or sharing my music with you,
I'd be able to show things about myself that I can't tell you in words,
more personal things, perhaps deeper things.
of how music is one of the most powerful interfaces we have,
from ourselves to the outside world.
The first is a really crazy project that we're building right now, called
Death and the Powers. And it's a big opera,
one of the larger opera projects going on in the world right now.
And it's about a man, rich, successful, powerful, who wants to live forever.
So, he figures out a way to download himself into his environment,
actually into a series of books.
So this guy wants to live forever, he downloads himself into his environment.
The main singer disappears at the beginning of the opera
and the entire stage becomes the main character. It becomes his legacy.
to the people we love, and what we can't.
Every object in the opera comes alive and is a gigantic music instrument,
like this chandelier. It takes up the whole stage. It looks like a chandelier,
but it's actually a robotic music instrument.
So, as you can see in this prototype, gigantic piano strings,
each string is controlled with a little robotic element --
either little bows that stroke the strings, propellers that tickle the strings,
acoustic signals that vibrate the strings. We also have an army of robots on stage.
These robots are the kind of the intermediary between the main character, Simon Powers,
and his family. There are a whole series of them, kind of like a Greek chorus.
They observe the action. We've designed these square robots that we're testing right now
at MIT called OperaBots. These OperaBots follow my music.
They follow the characters. They're smart enough, we hope,
not to bump into each other. They go off on their own.
And then they can also, when you snap, line up exactly the way you'd like to.
Even though they're cubes, they actually have a lot of personality.
Every single book is robotic, so they all move, they all make sound,
and when you put them all together, they turn into these walls,
which have the gesture and the personality of Simon Powers. So he's disappeared,
but the whole physical environment becomes this person.
This is how he's chosen to represent himself.
The books also have high-packed LEDs on the spines. So it's all display.
And here's the great baritone James Maddalena as he enters The System.
This is a sneak preview.
This premieres in Monaco -- it's in September 2009. If by any chance you can't make it,
another idea with this project -- here's this guy building his legacy
through this very unusual form, through music and through the environment.
But we're also making this available both online and in public spaces,
as a way of each of us to use music and images from our lives
to make our own legacy or to make a legacy of someone we love.
So instead of being grand opera, this opera will turn into what we're
thinking of as personal opera.
Everything I've shown you so far -- whether it's a hyper-cello for Yo-Yo Ma
or squeezy toy for a child -- the instruments stayed the same and are valuable
for a certain class of person: a virtuoso, a child.
But what if I could make an instrument that could be adapted
to the way I personally behave, to the way my hands work,
to what I do very skillfully, perhaps, to what I don't do so skillfully?
I think that this is the future of interface, it's the future of music, the future of instruments.
so that I can give you an example of what personal instruments might be like.
So, can you give a hand to Adam Boulanger, Ph.D. student from
the MIT Media Lab, and Dan Ellsey. Dan,
thanks to TED and to Bombardier Flexjet, Dan is here with us today
all the way from Tewksbury. He's a resident at Tewksbury Hospital.
This is by far the farthest he's strayed from Tewksbury Hospital, I can tell you that,
because he's motivated to meet with you today and show you his own music.
So, first of all, Dan, do you want to say hi to everyone and tell everyone who you are?
I have always loved music and I am excited to be able to conduct
my own music with this new software.
when we started working at Tewksbury. Everybody we met there was fantastic,
did fantastic music. Dan had never made music before, and it turned out
he was really fantastic at it. He's a born composer.
He's very shy, too.
So, turned out he's a fantastic composer, and over the last few years has been
a constant collaborator of ours. He has made many, many pieces.
He makes his own CDs. Actually, he is quite well known in the Boston area --
mentors people at the hospital and children, locally, in how to make their own music.
And I'll let Adam tell you. So, Adam is a Ph.D. student at MIT, an expert in music
technology and medicine. And Adam and Dan have become close collaborators.
What Adam's been working on for this last period is not only how to have Dan
be able easily to make his own pieces,
but how he can perform his piece using this kind of personal instrument.
So, you want to say a little bit about how you guys work?
following the Tewksbury work and it was really about how Dan is an expressive
person, and he's an intelligent and creative person. And it's in his face,
it's in his breathing, it's in his eyes. How come he can't perform
one of his pieces of music? That's our responsibility, and it doesn't make sense.
with precision, with control, and despite his physical disability, to be able to do that,
to be able to perform his piece of music.
So, the process and the technology --
basically, first we needed an engineering solution. So, you know,
we have a FireWire camera, it looked at an infrared pointer.
We went with the type of gesture metaphor that Dan was already used to
with his speaking controller.
And this was actually the least interesting part of the work, you know,
the design process. We needed an input; we needed continuous tracking;
in the software, we look at the types of shapes he's making.
where, basically, we're coding over Dan's shoulder at the hospital
extensively to figure out, you know, how does Dan move?
What's useful to him as an expressive motion?
You know, what's his metaphor for performance?
What types of things does he find
important to control and convey in a piece of music?
So all the parameter fitting, and really the technology
was stretched at that point to fit just Dan.
And, you know, I think this is a perspective shift. It's not that our technologies --
they provide access, they allow us to create pieces of creative work.
But what about expression? What about that moment when an artist delivers
that piece of work? You know, do our technologies allow us to express?
Do they provide structure for us to do that? And, you know, that's a personal relationship
to expression that is lacking in the technological sphere. So, you know,
with Dan, we needed a new design process, a new engineering process
to sort of discover his movement and his path to expression that allow him to perform.
And so that's what we'll do today.
about what you're going to play now?
TM: So Dan is going to play a piece of his, called "My Eagle Song".
In fact, this is the score for Dan's piece,
completely composed by Dan in Hyperscore.
So he can use his infrared tracker to go directly into Hyperscore.
He's incredibly fast at it, too, faster than I am, in fact.
So he can go in Hyperscore. You start out by making melodies and rhythms.
He can place those exactly where he wants.
Each one gets a color. He goes back into the composition window,
draws the lines, places everything the way he wants to. Looking at the Hyperscore,
you can see it also, you can see where the sections are,
something might continue for a while, change, get really crazy and then end
up with a big bang at the end.
we then figured out the best way to have him perform his piece.
It's going to be looked at by this camera, analyze his movements,
it's going to let Dan bring out all the different aspects of his music that he wants to.
And you're also going to notice a visual on the screen.
We asked one of our students to look at what the camera is measuring.
But instead of making it very literal, showing you exactly
the camera tracing, we turned it into a graphic that shows you the basic
movement, and shows the way it's being analyzed.
Dan's doing, but I think it will also show you, if you look at that movement,
that when Dan makes music, his motions are very purposeful, very precise,
very disciplined and they're also very beautiful.
So, in hearing this piece, as I mentioned before, the most important thing is
the music's great, and it'll show you who Dan is.
So, are we ready Adam?
(Applause)
(Applause)
And these are made of this kind of tube --
electricity tube, we call it in Holland.
And we can start a film about that,
and we can see a little bit backwards in time.
And they should survive over there,
The wind will move feathers on their back, which will drive their feet.
As soon as it walks into either the rolling surf or the dry sand,
And it is a sort of race, and each and every animal is different,
and the winning codes will multiply.
This is a new generation, a new family,
So, the wings pump up air in lemonade bottles,
which are on top of that.
And they can use that energy in case the wind falls away,
These are the distances of the tubes which make it walk that way.
In fact, it's a new invention of the wheel.
It works the same as a wheel.
In fact, this is better than a wheel,
because when you try to drive your bicycle on the beach,
And the feet just step over the sand,
So 5,000 years after the invention of the wheel,
but it can also walk on the wind very well.
It's 3.2 tons.
It has a feeler, where it can feel obstacles and turn around.
So, they have to survive all the dangers of the beach,
And this is the water feeler,
In fact, it is a step counter, and it counts the steps.
It's a binary step counter.
So it's a sort of imagination of the simple world of the beach animal.
I still have to help them a lot.
Cultural evolution is a dangerous child
for any species to let loose on its planet.
We humans are Earth's Pandoran species.
and we can't push it back in.
We're seeing the consequences all around us.
comes out of taking memetics seriously.
And it gives us a new way of thinking about
not only what's going on on our planet,
but what might be going on elsewhere in the cosmos.
So first of all, I'd like to say something about memetics
and the theory of memes,
and secondly, how this might answer questions about who's out there,
if indeed anyone is.
memetics is founded on the principle of Universal Darwinism.
it's the best idea anybody ever had.
as a best idea anybody ever had?
(Laughter)
Susan Blackmore: Someone says no, very loudly, from over there.
Because the idea was so simple,
I would say not just biological design,
but all of the design that we think of as human design.
It's all just the same thing happening.
What did Darwin say?
I know you know the idea, natural selection,
but let me just paraphrase "The Origin of Species," 1859,
in a few sentences.
if you have creatures that vary, and that can't be doubted --
I've been to the Galapagos, and I've measured the size of the beaks
and the size of the turtle shells and so on, and so on.
And 100 pages later.
(Laughter)
And if there is a struggle for life,
such that nearly all of these creatures die --
and this can't be doubted, I've read Malthus
and I've calculated how long it would take for elephants
to cover the whole world if they bred unrestricted, and so on and so on.
And if the very few that survive pass onto their offspring
whatever it was that helped them survive,
then those offspring must be better adapted
If, if, if, then.
He had no concept of the idea of an algorithm,
but that's what he described in that book,
and this is what we now know as the evolutionary algorithm.
variation, selection and heredity.
And as Dan Dennett puts it, if you have those,
then you must get evolution.
Or design out of chaos, without the aid of mind.
What do you think my favorite word is?
Audience: Chaos.
SB: Chaos? No. What? Mind? No.
Audience: Without.
SB: No, not without.
(Laughter)
You try them all in order: Mmm...?
Audience: Must.
SB: Must, at must. Must, must.
or a plan, or foresight, or anything else.
If there's something that is copied with variation
and it's selected, then you must get design appearing out of nowhere.
we think about genes this way.
Darwin didn't, of course; he didn't know about genes.
He talked mostly about animals and plants,
but also about languages evolving and becoming extinct.
But the principle of Universal Darwinism
is that any information that is varied and selected
will produce design.
in his 1976 bestseller, "The Selfish Gene."
It selfishly copies.
Not meaning it kind of sits around inside cells going, "I want to get copied."
But that it will get copied if it can,
regardless of the consequences.
It doesn't care about the consequences because it can't,
because it's just information being copied.
And he wanted to get away
from everybody thinking all the time about genes,
and so he said, "Is there another replicator out there on the planet?"
Ah, yes, there is.
All around us, still clumsily drifting about
in its primeval soup of culture, is another replicator.
Information that we copy from person to person, by imitation,
by language, by talking, by telling stories,
by wearing clothes, by doing things.
This is information copied with variation and selection.
This is design process going on.
He wanted a name for the new replicator.
So, he took the Greek word "mimeme," which means that which is imitated.
Remember that, that's the core definition:
that which is imitated.
And abbreviated it to meme, just because it sounds good
and made a good meme, an effective spreading meme.
So that's how the idea came about.
It's important to stick with that definition.
much misunderstood, much feared.
But a lot of these problems can be avoided
by remembering the definition.
A meme is not equivalent to an idea.
It's not an idea. It's not equivalent to anything else, really.
Stick with the definition.
It's that which is imitated,
or information which is copied from person to person.
So, let's see some memes.
in that particularly fetching way.
I wonder whether you invented that idea for yourself,
or copied it from someone else?
If you copied it from someone else, it's a meme.
And what about, oh, I can't see any interesting memes here.
All right everyone, who's got some interesting memes for me?
Oh, well, your earrings,
There are plenty more in the shops.
TED is a great meme-fest, masses of memes.
is to think, why do they spread?
They're selfish information, they will get copied, if they can.
But some of them will be copied because they're good,
or true, or useful, or beautiful.
Some of them will be copied even though they're not.
And I'm glad to say, as I expected, I found it when I came here,
and I'm sure all of you found it, too.
You go to your nice, posh, international hotel somewhere,
and you come in and you put down your clothes
and you go to the bathroom, and what do you see?
Audience: Bathroom soap.
SB: Pardon?
Audience: Soap.
SB: Soap, yeah. What else do you see?
Audience: (Inaudible)
SB: Mmm mmm.
Audience: Sink, toilet!
SB: Sink, toilet, yes, these are all memes, they're all memes,
but they're sort of useful ones, and then there's this one.
(Laughter)
What is this one doing?
(Laughter)
This has spread all over the world.
It's not surprising that you all found it
when you arrived in your bathrooms here.
But I took this photograph in a toilet at the back of a tent
in the eco-camp in the jungle in Assam.
(Laughter)
Who folded that thing up there, and why?
(Laughter)
Other people are just lazy and make mistakes.
Some hotels exploit the opportunity to put even more memes
with a little sticker.
(Laughter)
What is this all about?
I suppose it's there to tell you that somebody's
cleaned the place, and it's all lovely.
And you know, actually, all it tells you is that another person
has potentially spread germs from place to place.
(Laughter)
trying, in inverted commas -- i.e.,
that's the shorthand for, if they can get copied, they will.
They're using you and me as their propagating, copying machinery,
and we are the meme machines.
Why is this useful, or what does it tell us?
and what it means to be human,
of the origin of humans,
and all these things that make us unique,
all that long time ago, it always comes back to genes.
perhaps two and a half million years ago or so,
began imitating, there was a new copying process.
Copying with variation and selection.
could just copy the useful, beautiful, true things,
and not copy the other things.
or wearing strange clothes, or painting their faces,
or whatever.
which are trying to get the humans to have small economical brains
in other words, what turned out to be language --
competing to get the brains to get bigger and bigger.
So, the big brain, on this theory, is driven by the memes.
As the memes evolve, as they inevitably must,
they drive a bigger brain that is better at copying the memes
that are doing the driving.
This is why we've ended up with such peculiar brains,
that we like religion, and music, and art.
Language is a parasite that we've adapted to,
and we end up with a symbiotic relationship
with this new parasite.
we don't realize that that's how it began.
So, this is a view of what humans are.
All other species on this planet are gene machines only,
they don't imitate at all well, hardly at all.
We alone are gene machines and meme machines as well.
since I've been thinking about memes a lot,
is there a difference between the memes that we copy --
the words we speak to each other,
the gestures we copy, the human things --
and all these technological things around us?
I have always, until now, called them all memes,
but I do honestly think now
we need a new word for technological memes.
Because the processes are getting different.
We began, perhaps 5,000 years ago, with writing.
We put the storage of memes out there on a clay tablet,
but in order to get true temes and true teme machines,
you need to get the variation, the selection and the copying,
We're at this extraordinary point where we're nearly there,
that there are machines like that.
And indeed, in the short time I've already been at TED,
I see we're even closer than I thought we were before.
to become more like teme machines.
Our children are growing up very quickly learning to read,
learning to use machinery.
Now, what about what else is going on out there in the universe?
Is there anyone else out there?
People have been asking this question for a long time.
We've been asking it here at TED already.
In 1961, Frank Drake made his famous equation,
but I think he concentrated on the wrong things.
It's been very productive, that equation.
He wanted to estimate N,
the rate of planets, but crucially, intelligence.
Intelligence appears all over the place, in all kinds of guises.
Human intelligence is only one kind of a thing.
But what's really important is the replicators you have
and the levels of replicators, one feeding on the one before.
So, I would suggest that we don't think intelligence,
we think replicators.
N, the same thing,
the number of communicative civilizations out there
[that] we might expect in our galaxy.
Just start with the number of planets there are in our galaxy.
The fraction of those which get a first replicator.
The fraction of those that get the second replicator.
Because it's only the third replicator that's going to reach out --
sending information, sending probes, getting out there,
and communicating with anywhere else.
Because every step is dangerous.
Getting a new replicator is dangerous.
You can pull through, we have pulled through,
but it's dangerous.
Take the first step, as soon as life appeared on this earth.
We may take the Gaian view.
That was dangerous, all right.
Think of the big brain.
How many mothers do we have here?
You know all about big brains.
They are dangerous to give birth to,
are agonizing to give birth to.
(Laughter)
Ah, mm -- slightly different.
(Laughter)
it kills lots of mothers,
and it's very expensive to produce.
The genes are forced into producing all this myelin,
all the fat to myelinate the brain.
Do you know, sitting here,
your brain is using about 20 percent of your body's energy output
for two percent of your body weight?
It's a really expensive organ to run.
Why? Because it's producing the memes.
Louise Leakey talked yesterday
Could it be that this experiment in imitation,
this experiment in a second replicator,
is dangerous enough to kill people off?
well, it's dangerous again.
Why? Because the temes are selfish replicators
and they don't care about us, or our planet, or anything else.
They're just information, why would they?
That's how it seems to us.
Think, temes spreading because they must.
We are the old machines.
What's going to happen?
What does it mean to pull through?
Well, there are kind of two ways of pulling through.
with these implants, with the drugs,
with us merging with the technology.
And why would they do that?
Because we are self-replicating.
We have babies.
where the other option is viable.
Although it's closer, I heard this morning,
it's closer than I thought it was.
Where the teme machines themselves will replicate themselves.
That way, it wouldn't matter if the planet's climate
was utterly destabilized,
and it was no longer possible for humans to live here.
Because those teme machines, they wouldn't need --
they're not squishy, wet, oxygen-breathing,
warmth-requiring creatures.
They could carry on without us.
The second, I don't think we're that close.
It's coming, but we're not there yet.
The first, it's coming too.
But the damage that is already being done
to the planet is showing us how dangerous the third point is,
that third danger point, getting a third replicator.
(Applause)
Chris Anderson: That was an incredible talk.
SB: Thank you. I scared myself.
CA: (Laughter)
What I want to talk to you about today is
virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.
What does this all mean for us?
What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.
It's going to become super exciting as we transform
to this highly immersive and interactive world.
With graphics, computing power, low latencies,
these types of applications and possibilities
are going to stream rich data into your lives.
So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,
are all about extending our current search metaphor.
remembering URLs, saving favorites.
As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,
the Web matching, the index crawling.
But we want to use our brain!
We want to navigate, explore, discover information.
In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.
We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.
than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?
Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?
So Virtual Earth is about starting off
creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.
Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,
global perspective, local knowledge.
So when you think about this problem,
what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,
from ground vehicles, from people.
This process is an engineering problem,
a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.
This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.
In addition, it's multi-spectral.
We collect four gigabits per second of data,
if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.
That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,
vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.
what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close
to establish that what it's like-type experience.
I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,
kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.
So a little unknown secret is --
did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?
The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.
Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.
(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.
But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job.
This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes
to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,
disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.
Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.
We made it all freely available on the Web, just to --
it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.
it's all about software, algorithms and math.
You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models
we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.
We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.
Extract geometry from the images.
This process is a very calculated process.
In fact, it was always done manual.
Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor
for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.
They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.
They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.
We do this all through software, algorithms and math --
a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.
We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,
and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?
An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery
while maintaining the fluidity of the model?
I'll wrap up by showing you the --
this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.
What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,
this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.
A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.
You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.
By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.
The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.
We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,
and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.
I thank you very much for your time.
(Applause)
I thought it was quite an interesting experiment
in the principles of rocket science.
where none of the spectators are.
Come on, come on, come on.
with things bumping and grinding.
when these things take place in a fraction of a second.
Gene from Alabama drives out there
with this rocket he's built with X-ray sensors, video cameras,
and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science,
understand the importance of physics and math
I was here about four years ago,
talking about the relationship of design and happiness.
At the very end of it, I showed a list under that title.
I learned very few things in addition since
(Laughter) --
but made a whole number of them into projects since.
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland:
"Everybody always thinks they are right."
They were combined in the media.
"Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on."
We're doing changing media.
This is a projection that can see the viewer
as the viewer walks by.
You can't help but actually ripping that spider web apart.
All of these things are pieces of graphic design.
We do them for our clients.
They are commissioned.
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment
or pay for all the billboards or the production of these,
so there's always a client attached to them.
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street
that's lined with fashion stores.
"Worrying solves nothing."
"Money does not make me happy"
appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine.
The printer lost the file, didn't tell us.
When the magazine -- actually, when I got the subscription --
it was 12 following pages.
It said, "Money does does make me happy."
And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me
that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz
into letting us wrap his building.
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz.
It just says "Money," and if you look down the side street,
it says, "does not make me happy."
We had a show that just came down last week in New York.
We steamed up the windows permanently,
and every hour we had a different designer come in
and write these things that they've learned into the steam in the window.
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser,
Massimo Vignelli.
Singapore was quite in discussion.
This is a little spot that we filmed there
that's to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore.
And, of course, it's one that's dear to my heart,
because all of these sentiments --
some banal, some a bit more profound --
all originally had come out of my diary.
And I do go often into the diary
and check if I wanted to change something about the situation.
If it's -- see it for a long enough time,
I actually do something about it.
And the very last one is a billboard.
This is our roof in New York, the roof of the studio.
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint.
We let that lie around in the sun.
As you all know, newsprint yellows significantly in the sun.
After a week, we took the stencils and the leaves off,
shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot,
so on day one the billboard said,
"Complaining is silly. Either act or forget."
Three days later it faded, and a week later,
no more complaining anywhere.
(Laughter)
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
Good morning.
Let's look for a minute at the greatest icon of all, Leonardo da Vinci.
We're all familiar with his fantastic work --
his drawings, his paintings, his inventions, his writings.
But we do not know his face.
Thousands of books have been written about him,
but there's controversy, and it remains, about his looks.
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians.
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn't it?
Let's find out.
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him.
He drew people, anatomy, plants, animals, landscapes, buildings, water, everything.
But no faces?
I find that hard to believe.
His contemporaries made faces, like the ones you see here --
en face or three-quarters.
So, surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo
must have made self-portraits from time to time.
So let's try to find them.
and look for self-portraits, we would find his face looking at us.
So I looked at all of his drawings, more than 700,
and looked for male portraits.
There are about 120, you see them here.
Which ones of these could be self-portraits?
Well, for that they have to be done as we just saw, en face or three-quarters.
So we can eliminate all the profiles.
It also has to be sufficiently detailed.
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized.
And we know from his contemporaries
that Leonardo was a very handsome, even beautiful man.
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures.
(Laughter)
And here they are.
Yes, indeed, the old man is there,
as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus.
And lastly, the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted, "The Musician."
I should explain why I have some right to talk about them.
I've made more than 1,100 portraits myself
for newspapers, over the course of 300 -- 30 years, sorry, 30 years only.
(Laughter)
But there are 1,100, and very few artists have drawn so many faces.
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces.
OK, now let's look at these three portraits.
And hold onto your seats, because if we zoom in on those faces,
remark how they have the same broad forehead, the horizontal eyebrows,
the long nose, the curved lips and the small, well-developed chin.
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike.
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait,
and look, they are very similar.
Now, are they made in the right order?
The young man should be made first.
And as you see here from the years that they were created,
it is indeed the case.
They are made in the right order.
What was the age of Leonardo at the time? Does that fit?
Yes, it does. He was 33, 38 and 63 when these were made.
of the same age as Leonardo at the time.
But how do we know it's him, and not someone else?
Well, we need a reference.
And here's the only picture of Leonardo that's widely accepted.
It's a statue made by Verrocchio, of David,
for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15.
And if we now compare the face of the statue,
with the face of the musician, you see the very same features again.
The statue is the reference, and it connects the identity of Leonardo
to those three faces.
It's only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first.
The icon of icons finally has a face.
Here he is: Leonardo da Vinci.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about two stories today.
One is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand
and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions
how we can generate a new engine for economic growth
and dramatically reduce C02 in the other sectors.
We need to reduce C02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent
in order to avert catastrophic effects.
And I am astounded that I'm standing here to tell you that.
What are catastrophic effects? A three degree centigrade climate change rise
And I'm really worried, because when people talk about cars
the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking,
Here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes.
So, Zipcar is a company that I founded seven years ago,
but it's an example of something called car sharing.
What Zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas
for members to reserve, by the hour and by the day, instead of using their own car.
How does it feel to be a person using a Zipcar?
It means that I pay only for what I need.
It means that I can choose a car exactly for that particular trip.
So, here's a woman that reserved MiniMia, and she had her day.
I can take a BMW when I'm seeing clients.
Not only do I have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world
that I can have at my beck and call,
but heaven forbid I would ever maintain
or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it.
I get all the good stuff and none of the bad.
The social result is that today's Zipcar has 100,000 members
driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces.
The company has been doubling in size ever since I founded it, or greater.
People adore the company. And it's better,
you know? They like it.
So, how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles?
It's because they said, "It's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day.
If I'm going to go buy some ice cream,
do I really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream? Or maybe I'll do without.
Maybe I would have bought the ice cream when I did some other errand."
It required that it was completely trivial: that it takes 30 seconds
to reserve a car, go get it, drive it.
And for me, as a service provider,
I would never be able to provide you a car for an hour
if the transaction cost was anything.
So, without these wireless technologies, this, as a concept, could never happen.
I'm launching it in about three weeks --
and I hope to do for ridesharing what I did for car sharing.
This will apply to people across all of America.
Today, 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles,
yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool.
And I think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems
to completely change how people feel about ridesharing
and make that trip much more efficient.
people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone
is this incredibly great social event out of their day.
You know, how did you get to TED? You went with other TEDsters.
How fabulous. Why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car?
and it will also, I think, enhance our freedom of mobility.
Where can I go today and who can I do it with?
Those are the types of things that you will look at and feel.
the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is, I told you, 75 percent;
One last piece about this, of course, is that it's enabled by wireless technologies.
And it's the cost of driving that's making people want to be able to do this.
The average American spends 19 percent of their income on their car,
and that's persisted for the four years in which they've been doing congestion pricing.
So again, we can see that price plays an enormous role in people's willingness
to reduce their driving behavior.
We've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982.
There's a huge slack in that system;
and is, again, wirelessly enabled.
You weren't going to put tollbooths around the city of London
and open and shut those gates.
And what congestion pricing is is that it's a technology trial and a psychological trial
because today we pay for our maintenance
and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes.
And as we get our cars more fuel-efficient,
that's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes,
so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive.
Whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies
will be happening with road pricing.
Car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed.
We need to put this better market feedback.
And if we have it, you'll decide how many miles to drive,
what mode of travel, where to live and work.
And wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible.
this congestion pricing? Road pricing is coming.
When are we going to do it? Are we going to wait
10 to 15 years for this to happen
or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years?
Because I'm going to say, that is going to be the tool that's going to turn our usage overnight.
This is my big vision.
There is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide,
respond to emergencies, get traffic moving,
provide a new engine for economic growth
And this is a moment from "The Graduate." Do you remember this moment?
You guys are going to be the handsome young guy
and I'm going to be the wise businessman.
"I want to say one word to you, just one word."
"Ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks."
These are also called mesh networks.
And in a mesh, every device contributes to and expands the network,
and I think you might have heard a little bit about it before.
You'll be hearing later today from Alan Kay.
These laptops, when a child opens them up,
they communicate with every single child in the classroom,
within that school, within that village.
And what is the cost of that communication system?
Zero dollars a month.
Here's another example: in New Orleans,
video cameras were mesh-enabled
so that they could monitor crime in the downtown French Quarter.
When the hurricane happened,
the only communication system standing was the mesh network.
Volunteers flew in, added a whole bunch of devices,
and for the next 12 months,
So, the beauty of mesh networks:
you can have these very low-cost devices.
Zero ongoing communication costs. Highly scalable;
you can just keep adding them, and as in Katrina,
you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there's some, we can still communicate.
They're resilient; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design.
There isn't anybody in Washington lobbying to make it happen --
or in those municipalities, to build out their cities with these wireless networks --
because there's zero ongoing communications cost.
So, the examples that I gave you are these islands of mesh networks,
Are you guys ready again -- "The Graduate"?
This time you will still play the handsome young thing, but I'll be the sexy woman.
These are the next two lines in the movie.
in every single car across America.
we are going to do road tolls,
gas taxes are going to become road pricing.
These things are going to happen.
What's the wireless technology we're going to use?
Maybe we should use a good one. When are we going to do it?
Maybe we shouldn't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen.
and require that this network be accessible to everyone, with open standards.
Right now in the transportation sector, we're creating these wireless devices --
I guess you guys might have Fast Pass here or Easy Lane --
that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks.
What is the point?
We're transferring just a few little data bits
when we're doing road controlling, road pricing.
We have this incredible excess capacity.
So, we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast,
we can have resilient nationwide communication systems,
we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors.
What you can do with that tool: we can create an economic engine.
Information should be free, and access to information should be free,
it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it --
So, going back to one of my earlier thoughts.
Imagine if every one of these buses in Lagos was part of the mesh network.
When I went this morning to Larry Brilliant's TEDTalk prize
-- his fabulous networks --
to make all that happen.
And we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that
this little slice of things is going to be for free.
We could make billions of dollars on top of it,
implement a gas tax immediately;
My talk is "Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes."
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another,
but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes,
you'll see a little bit of a relation.
It ties to origami. So let me start.
What is origami?
Most people think they know what origami is. It's this:
flapping birds, toys, cootie catchers, that sort of thing.
And that is what origami used to be.
But it's become something else.
It's become an art form, a form of sculpture.
is folding is how we create the form.
You know, it's very old. This is a plate from 1797.
It shows these women playing with these toys.
If you look close, it's this shape, called a crane.
Every Japanese kid
learns how to fold that crane.
So this art has been around for hundreds of years,
and you would think something
that's been around that long -- so restrictive, folding only --
everything that could be done has been done a long time ago.
And that might have been the case.
a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along,
and he created tens of thousands of new designs.
But even more importantly, he created a language,
a way we could communicate,
a code of dots, dashes and arrows.
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore's talk,
we now have a means of transmitting information
with heredity and selection,
and we know where that leads.
And where it has led in origami
is to things like this.
This is an origami figure --
one sheet, no cuts, folding only, hundreds of folds.
This, too, is origami,
and this shows where we've gone in the modern world.
Naturalism. Detail.
You can get horns, antlers --
even, if you look close, cloven hooves.
And what changed is something
you might not have expected in an art,
which is math.
That is, people applied mathematical principles
to the art,
to discover the underlying laws.
And that leads to a very powerful tool.
The secret to productivity in so many fields --
and in origami --
is letting dead people do your work for you.
take your problem,
and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved,
and use their solutions.
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami.
Origami revolves around crease patterns.
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint
for an origami figure.
And you can't just draw them arbitrarily.
They have to obey four simple laws.
And they're very simple, easy to understand.
The first law is two-colorability. You can color any crease pattern
with just two colors without ever having
the same color meeting.
The directions of the folds at any vertex --
the number of mountain folds, the number of valley folds --
always differs by two. Two more or two less.
Nothing else.
If you look at the angles around the fold,
you find that if you number the angles in a circle,
all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line,
all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line.
And if you look at how the layers stack,
you'll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets,
a sheet can never
penetrate a fold.
So that's four simple laws. That's all you need in origami.
All of origami comes from that.
give rise to that kind of complexity?"
But indeed, the laws of quantum mechanics
can be written down on a napkin,
and yet they govern all of chemistry,
all of life, all of history.
If we obey these laws,
we can do amazing things.
So in origami, to obey these laws,
we can take simple patterns --
like this repeating pattern of folds, called textures --
and by itself it's nothing.
But if we follow the laws of origami,
we can put these patterns into another fold
that itself might be something very, very simple,
but when we put it together,
we get something a little different.
This fish, 400 scales --
again, it is one uncut square, only folding.
And if you don't want to fold 400 scales,
you can back off and just do a few things,
and add plates to the back of a turtle, or toes.
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars
on a flag, with 13 stripes.
And if you want to go really crazy,
1,000 scales on a rattlesnake.
And this guy's on display downstairs,
so take a look if you get a chance.
have related to how we get parts of creatures.
And I can put it in this simple equation.
We take an idea,
combine it with a square, and you get an origami figure.
And you might say, "Can you really be that specific?
I mean, a stag beetle -- it's got two points for jaws,
it's got antennae. Can you be that specific in the detail?"
And yeah, you really can.
So how do we do that? Well, we break it down
into a few smaller steps.
So let me stretch out that equation.
I start with my idea. I abstract it.
What's the most abstract form? It's a stick figure.
And from that stick figure, I somehow have to get to a folded shape
that has a part for every bit of the subject,
a flap for every leg.
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base,
you can make the legs narrower, you can bend them,
you can turn it into the finished shape.
Take an idea, draw a stick figure.
The last step is not so hard, but that middle step --
going from the abstract description to the folded shape --
that's hard.
But that's the place where the mathematical ideas
can get us over the hump.
And I'm going to show you all how to do that
so you can go out of here and fold something.
But we're going to start small.
This base has a lot of flaps in it.
We're going to learn how to make one flap.
How would you make a single flap?
Take a square. Fold it in half, fold it in half, fold it again,
until it gets long and narrow,
and then we'll say at the end of that, that's a flap.
I could use that for a leg, an arm, anything like that.
Well, if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern,
you can see that the upper left corner of that shape
is the paper that went into the flap.
So that's the flap, and all the rest of the paper's left over.
I can use it for something else.
Well, there are other ways of making a flap.
There are other dimensions for flaps.
If I make the flaps skinnier, I can use a bit less paper.
If I make the flap as skinny as possible,
I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed.
And you can see there, it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap.
There's other ways of making flaps.
If I put the flap on the edge, it uses a half circle of paper.
And if I make the flap from the middle, it uses a full circle.
So, no matter how I make a flap,
it needs some part
of a circular region of paper.
So now we're ready to scale up.
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps?
What do I need? I need a lot of circles.
origami artists discovered these principles
and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures
just by packing circles.
And here's where the dead people start to help us out,
because lots of people have studied
the problem of packing circles.
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists
looking at disc packings and arrangements.
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes.
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles,
you decorate the patterns of circles with lines
according to more rules. That gives you the folds.
Those folds fold into a base. You shape the base.
You get a folded shape -- in this case, a cockroach.
And it's so simple.
And you say, "Well, you know, how simple is that?"
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things
in very basic terms, and with this, we could.
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago
called TreeMaker, and you can download it from my website.
It's free. It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows.
and it calculates the crease pattern.
It does the circle packing, calculates the crease pattern,
and if you use that stick figure that I just showed --
which you can kind of tell, it's a deer, it's got antlers --
you'll get this crease pattern.
And if you take this crease pattern, you fold on the dotted lines,
you'll get a base that you can then shape
into a deer,
with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted.
And if you want a different deer,
not a white-tailed deer, but you want a mule deer, or an elk,
you change the packing,
and you can do an elk.
Or you could do a moose.
Or, really, any other kind of deer.
These techniques revolutionized this art.
We found we could do insects,
spiders, which are close,
things with legs, things with legs and wings,
things with legs and antennae.
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square
wasn't interesting enough,
then you could do two praying mantises
from a single uncut square.
She's eating him.
I call it "Snack Time."
This -- you can put details,
toes and claws. A grizzly bear has claws.
This tree frog has toes.
Actually, lots of people in origami now put toes into their models.
Toes have become an origami meme,
because everyone's doing it.
You can make multiple subjects.
So these are a couple of instrumentalists.
The guitar player from a single square,
the bass player from a single square.
And if you say, "Well, but the guitar, bass --
that's not so hot.
Do a little more complicated instrument."
Well, then you could do an organ.
of origami-on-demand.
So now people can say, "I want exactly this and this and this,"
and you can go out and fold it.
And sometimes you create high art,
and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work.
But I want to show you some examples.
Everything you'll see here,
except the car, is origami.
Computers made things move,
but these were all real, folded objects that we made.
And we can use this not just for visuals,
but it turns out to be useful even in the real world.
Surprisingly, origami
and the structures that we've developed in origami
turn out to have applications in medicine, in science,
in space, in the body, consumer electronics and more.
One of the earliest was this pattern,
this folded pattern,
studied by Koryo Miura, a Japanese engineer.
He studied a folding pattern, and realized
this could fold down into an extremely compact package
that had a very simple opening and closing structure.
And he used it to design this solar array.
It's an artist's rendition, but it flew in a Japanese telescope
in 1995.
Now, there is actually a little origami
in the James Webb Space Telescope, but it's very simple.
The telescope, going up in space,
it unfolds in two places.
It folds in thirds. It's a very simple pattern --
you wouldn't even call that origami.
They certainly didn't need to talk to origami artists.
then you might need some origami.
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab
had an idea for a telescope much larger.
They called it the Eyeglass.
The design called for geosynchronous orbit
25,000 miles up,
100-meter diameter lens.
So, imagine a lens the size of a football field.
There were two groups of people who were interested in this:
planetary scientists, who want to look up,
and then other people, who wanted to look down.
Whether you look up or look down,
how do you get it up in space? You've got to get it up there in a rocket.
And rockets are small. So you have to make it smaller.
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller?
Well, about the only way is to fold it up somehow.
So you have to do something like this.
This was a small model.
But this pattern's not going to work
to get something 100 meters down to a few meters.
So the Livermore engineers,
wanting to make use of the work of dead people,
or perhaps live origamists, said,
"Let's see if someone else is doing this sort of thing."
So they looked into the origami community,
we got in touch with them, and I started working with them.
And we developed a pattern together
that scales to arbitrarily large size,
but that allows any flat ring or disc
to fold down into a very neat, compact cylinder.
And they adopted that for their first generation,
which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter.
But this is a five-meter telescope --
has about a quarter-mile focal length.
And it works perfectly on its test range,
and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle.
Japan Aerospace [Exploration] Agency flew a solar sail,
and you can see here that the sail expands out,
and you can still see the fold lines.
The problem that's being solved here is
something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination,
but needs to be small for the journey.
And that works whether you're going into space,
or whether you're just going into a body.
And this example is the latter.
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You
at Oxford University.
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination,
but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there,
through your blood vessels.
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern,
based on a model called the water bomb base.
of getting flat sheets
into a small space.
And they want to do their design by simulation.
So they need to figure out how, in a computer,
to flatten an airbag.
And the algorithms that we developed
to do insects
turned out to be the solution for airbags
to do their simulation.
And so they can do a simulation like this.
Those are the origami creases forming,
and now you can see the airbag inflate
and find out, does it work?
And that leads
to a really interesting idea.
Well, the heart stent
came from that little blow-up box
that you might have learned in elementary school.
It's the same pattern, called the water bomb base.
The airbag-flattening algorithm
came from all the developments
of circle packing and the mathematical theory
that was really developed
just to create insects -- things with legs.
The thing is, that this often happens
in math and science.
When you get math involved, problems that you solve
for aesthetic value only,
or to create something beautiful,
turn around and turn out
to have an application in the real world.
And as weird and surprising as it may sound,
origami may someday even save a life.
Thanks.
This means, "I'm smiling."
So does that.
This means "mouse."
"Cat."
Here we have a story.
The start of the story, where this means guy,
and that is a ponytail on a passer-by.
Here's where it happens.
These are when.
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player.
She wears it every day.
It's not considered vintage --
she just likes certain music to sound a certain way.
Look at her posture; it's remarkable.
That's because she dances.
Now he, the guy, takes all of this in, figuring,
"Honestly, geez, what are my chances?"
or "I heart you!"
"I'm laughing out loud."
"I want to give you a hug."
But he comes up with that, you know.
He tells her, "I'd like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug."
Add some water.
Seven different salts.
He means he's got this sudden notion to stand on dry land,
but just panhandle at the ocean.
He says, "You look like a mermaid, but you walk like a waltz."
And the girl goes, "Wha'?"
So, the guy replies, "Yeah, I know, I know.
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate.
At least, that's how it seems.
I'm like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes --
for swearing, awkward silences, and very simple rhyme schemes.
I'm a monkey --
(Laughter) --
blowing kisses
at a butterfly.
But I'm still suggesting you and I should meet.
First, soon, and then a lot.
I'm thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow,
but I'll stay until you show up, ponytail or not.
Hell, ponytail alone.
I don't know what else to tell you.
I got a pencil you can borrow.
You can put it in your phone."
But the girl does not budge, does not smile, does not frown.
She just says, "No thank you."
You know?
[ "i don't need 2 write it down." ]
This is a recent comic strip from the Los Angeles Times.
The punch line?
"On the other hand, I don't have to get up at four
every single morning to milk my Labrador."
This is a recent cover of New York Magazine.
Best hospitals where doctors say they would go for cancer treatment,
births, strokes, heart disease, hip replacements, 4 a.m. emergencies.
And this is a song medley I put together --
some sort of meme or shorthand?
It means something like you are awake at the worst possible hour.
A time for plotting to whack the chief of police,
like in this classic scene from "The Godfather."
Coppola's script describes these guys as, "exhausted in shirt sleeves.
It is four in the morning."
like autopsies and embalmings in Isabel Allende's
"The House of the Spirits."
After the breathtaking green-haired Rosa is murdered,
the doctors preserve her with unguents and morticians' paste.
They worked until four o'clock in the morning.
like in last April's New Yorker magazine.
This short fiction piece by Martin Amis
starts out, "On September 11, 2001, he opened his eyes
at 4 a.m. in Portland, Maine,
and Mohamed Atta's last day began."
For a time that I find to be the most placid
and uneventful hour of the day, four in the morning sure gets
an awful lot of bad press --
And it made me suspicious.
I figured, surely some of the most creative artistic minds in the world, really,
aren't all defaulting back to this one easy trope
like they invented it, right?
Could it be there is something more going on here?
Something deliberate, something secret,
and who got the four in the morning bad rap ball rolling anyway?
I say this guy -- Alberto Giacometti, shown here
with some of his sculptures on the Swiss 100 franc note.
He did it with this famous piece
from the New York Museum of Modern Art.
Its title -- "The Palace at Four in the Morning --
Not just the earliest cryptic reference
to four in the morning I can find.
I believe that this so-called first surrealist sculpture
may provide an incredible key to virtually
every artistic depiction of four in the morning to follow it.
I call this The Giacometti Code, a TED exclusive.
No, feel free to follow along on your Blackberries
or your iPhones if you've got them.
for four in the morning.
Results vary, of course. This is pretty typical.
The top 10 results yield you
four hits for Faron Young's song, "It's Four in the Morning,"
three hits for Judi Dench's film, "Four in the Morning,"
one hit for Wislawa Szymborska's poem, "Four in the Morning."
But what, you may ask, do a Polish poet, a British Dame,
a country music hall of famer all have in common
besides this totally excellent Google ranking?
in 1932.
which incidentally is Judi Dench's birthday.
He languished until the following afternoon when he finally succumbed
to a supposedly self-inflicted gunshot wound at the age of 64 --
which incidentally is how old Alberto Giacometti was when he died.
She has the world's most absolutely watertight alibi.
On that very day, December 10, 1996 while Mr. Four in the Morning,
Faron Young, was giving up the ghost in Nashville, Tennessee,
Ms. Four in the Morning -- or one of them anyway -- Wislawa Szymborska
was in Stockholm, Sweden, accepting the Nobel Prize for Literature.
100 years to the day after the death of Alfred Nobel himself.
Coincidence? No, it's creepy.
That's like me telling you,
"Hey, you know the Nobel Prize was established in 1901,
which coincidentally is the same year Alberto Giacometti was born?"
No, not everything fits so tidily into the paradigm,
but that does not mean there's not something going on
at the highest possible levels.
In fact there are people in this room
who may not want me to show you this clip we're about to see.
You mean if I want pork chops, even in the middle of the night,
your guy will fry them up?
Now do you need towels, laundry, maids?
It is Christmas Day, 4 a.m.
There's a rumble in my stomach.
Let me see if I got this straight, Matt.
the most remote possible moment of not just the clock,
but the whole freaking calendar, he comes up with 0400
on the birthday of the Baby Jesus.
And no, I don't know how it works
into the whole puzzling scheme of things, but obviously
I know a coded message when I see one.
And folks, you can buy a copy of Bill Clinton's "My Life"
from the bookstore here at TED.
Parse it cover to cover for whatever hidden references you want.
Or you can go to the Random House website where there is this excerpt.
And how far down into it you figure we'll have to scroll
to get to the golden ticket?
Would you believe about a dozen paragraphs?
This is page 474 on your paperbacks if you're following along:
"Though it was getting better, I still wasn't satisfied
with the inaugural address.
My speechwriters must have been tearing their hair out
because as we worked between one and four in the morning
on Inauguration Day, I was still changing it."
for this historic quadrennial event that just sort of sneaks up on you.
And then --
"We went back to Blair House to look at the speech for the last time.
It had gotten a lot better since 4 a.m."
Well, how could it have?
By his own writing, this man was either asleep,
at a prayer meeting with Al and Tipper or learning how to launch
a nuclear missile out of a suitcase.
What happens to American presidents at 0400 on inauguration day?
What happened to William Jefferson Clinton?
We might not ever know.
And I noticed, he's not exactly around here today
to face any tough questions.
I mean after all, this whole business happened on his watch.
But if he were here --
that on this day Bill Clinton began a journey --
a journey that saw him go on to become
the first Democrat president elected
to two consecutive terms in decades.
In generations.
The first since this man, Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
who began his own unprecedented journey
way back at his own first election,
way back in a simpler time, way back in 1932 --
(Laughter)
The year, let's remember, that this voice, now departed,
first came a-cryin' into this big old crazy world of ours.
You will understand nothing with my type of English.
It's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people.
I must tell you I am like that, not very comfortable,
because usually, in life, I think my job is absolutely useless.
I mean, I feel useless.
Now after Carolyn, and all the other guys, I feel like shit.
And definitively, I don't know why I am here,
but -- you know the nightmare you can have, like you are an impostor,
you arrive at the opera, and they push you, "You must sing!"
I don't know. (Laughter)
we shall try to speak about something else.
We can start, if you want, by understanding --
it's just to start, it's not interesting, but -- how I work.
When somebody comes to me and ask for what I am known,
I mean, yes, lemon squeezer, toilet brush, toothpick, beautiful toilet seats,
and why not -- a toothbrush?
I don't try to design the toothbrush.
I don't try to say, "Oh, that will be a beautiful object," or something like that.
That doesn't interest me.
The one, we can call it the cynical design,
that means the design invented by Raymond Loewy in the '50s,
who said, what is ugly is a bad sale, la laideur se vend mal, which is terrible.
It means the design must be just the weapon for marketing,
for producer to make product more sexy, like that,
they sell more: it's shit, it's obsolete, it's ridiculous.
I call that the cynical design.
it's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers. (Laughter)
After, there is people like me, who try to deserve to exist,
and who are so ashamed to make this useless job, who try to do it in another way,
and they try, I try, to not make the object for the object but for the result,
for the profit for the human being, the person who will use it.
If we take the toothbrush -- I don't think about the toothbrush.
I think, "What will be the effect of the brush in the mouth?"
And to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth,
I must imagine: Who owns this mouth?
What is the life of the owner of this mouth? In what society [does] this guy live?
What civilization creates this society?
What animal species creates this civilization?
When I arrive -- and I take one minute, I am not so intelligent --
when I arrive at the level of animal species, that becomes real interesting.
But when I come back, I can understand why I shall not do it,
because today to not do it, it's more positive than do it, or how I shall do it.
But to come back, where I am at the animal species, there is things to see.
There is things to see, there is the big challenge.
The big challenge in front of us.
Because there is not a human production
which exists outside of what I call "the big image."
The big image is our story, our poetry, our romanticism.
Our poetry is our mutation, our life.
We must remember, and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old,
that life appears four billion years ago, around -- four billion point two?
that's all, of Christmas gifts.
And before, there was this soup, called "soupe primordiale,"
this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop --
sort of dirty mud, no life, nothing.
So then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive --
pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies.
Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo, bloop-bloop -- ah, wake up!
At the end, finally, that succeeds, and life appears.
We was so, so stupid. The most stupid bacteria.
Even, I think, we copy our way to reproduce, you know what I mean,
and something of -- oh no, forget it.
after, we become a monkey; after, we become what we are today: a super-monkey,
and the fun is, the super-monkey we are today, is at half of the story.
Can you imagine? From that stupid bacteria to us,
with a microphone, with a computer, with an iPod: four billion years.
And we know, and especially Carolyn knows, that when the sun will implode,
the earth will burn, explode, I don't know what,
and this is scheduled for four, four billion years?
Yes, she said, something like that. OK, that means we are at half of the story.
Fantastic! It's a beauty!
Can you imagine? It's very symbolic.
Because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today.
And today, we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years.
And this territory is fantastic.
It's our romanticism. Mu-ta-tion. We are mutants.
And if we don't deeply understand, if we don't integrate that we are mutants,
we completely miss the story.
Because every generation thinks we are the final one.
We have a way to look at Earth like that, you know,
"I am the man. The final man.
You know, we mutate during four billion years before, but now, because it's me, we stop. Fin. (Laughter)
For the end, for the eternity, it is one with a red jacket."
Something like that. I am not sure of that. (Laughter)
Because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that.
There is so many things to do; it's so fresh.
but everybody is obliged to participate.
And to participate, for a mutant, there is a minimum of exercise, a minimum of sport.
We can say that.
The first, if you want -- there is so many --
but one which is very easy to do, is the duty of vision.
I can explain you. I shall try.
If you walk like that, it's OK, it's OK, you can walk,
but perhaps, because you walk with the eyes like that, you will not see, oh, there is a hole.
And you will fall, and you will die. Dangerous.
OK, I can see, if I found something, up, up, and they continue, up up up.
I raise the angle of vision, but it's still very -- selfish, selfish, egoiste -- yes, selfish.
You, you survive. It's OK.
If you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go,
"I see you, oh my God you are here, how are you, I can help you,
I can design for you a new toothbrush, new toilet brush," something like that.
I live in society; I live in community.
It's OK. You start to be in the territory of intelligence, we can say.
From this level, the more you can raise this angle of view,
the more you will be important for the society.
The more you will rise, the more you will be important for the civilization.
The more you will rise, to see far and high, like that,
the more you will be important for the story of our mutation.
That means intelligent people are in this angle. That is intelligence.
From this to here, that, it's genius.
Ptolemy, Eratosthenes, Einstein, things like that.
Nobody's obliged to be a genius.
It's better, but nobody.
There is some danger, there is some trap. One trap: the vertical.
Because at the vertical of us, if you look like that,
"Ah! my God, there is God. Ah! God!"
God is a trap. God is the answer when we don't know the answer.
That means, when your brain is not enough big, when you don't understand,
you go, "Ah, it's God, it's God." That's ridiculous.
That's why -- jump, like that? No, don't jump.
Come back. Because, after, there is another trap.
If you look like that, you look to the past,
or you look inside if you are very flexible, inside yourself.
It's called schizophrenia, and you are dead also.
you will raise your angle of view.
Out, more of the horizontal. You are an intelligence.
Never forget -- like that, like that.
It's very, very, very important.
What, what else we can say about that? Why do that?
It's because we -- if we look from far, we see our line of evolution.
This line of evolution is clearly positive.
From far, this line looks very smooth, like that.
But if you take a lens, like that, this line is ack, ack, ack, ack, ack. Like that.
It's made of light and shadow.
We can say light is civilization, shadow is barbaria.
And it's very important to know where we are.
Because some cycle, there is a spot in the cycle,
and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle.
but in the '80s, there was not too much war, like that, it was --
we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized.
In this case, people like me are acceptable.
We can say, "It's luxurious time."
We have time to think, we have time to I don't know what,
speak about art and things like that.
It's OK. We are in the light.
But sometimes, like today, we fall, we fall so fast, so fast to shadow, we fall so fast to barbaria.
With many, many, many, many face of barbaria.
Because it's not, the barbaria we have today, it's perhaps not the barbaria we think.
There is different type of barbaria.
That's why we must adapt.
That means, when barbaria is back, forget the beautiful chairs, forget the beautiful hotel,
forget design, even -- I'm sorry to say -- forget art.
Forget all that. There is priority; there is urgency.
You must go back to politics, you must go back to radicalization,
I'm sorry if that's not very English.
You must go back to fight, to battle.
That's why I am here, to try to do it the best possible.
But I know that even I do it the best possible
-- that's why I'm the best -- it's nothing.
Because it's not the right time.
That's why I say that. I say that, because, I repeat, nothing exist if it's not in the good rhythym,
the rhythym of our beautiful dream, of this civilization.
And because we must all work to finish this story.
Because the scenario of this civilization
-- about love, progress, and things like that -- it's OK,
but there is so many different, other scenarios of other civilizations.
This scenario, of this civilization, was about becoming powerful, intelligent,
like this idea we have invented, this concept of God.
We are God now. We are. It's almost done.
We have just to finish the story.
That is very, very important.
And when you don't understand really what's happened,
you cannot go and fight and work and build and things like that.
You go to the future back, back, back, back, like that.
And you can fall, and it's very dangerous.
No, you must really understand that.
And the beauty of this, in perhaps 50 years, 60 years, we can finish completely this civilization,
and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story,
a new poetry, a new romanticism.
With billions of people who have been born, worked, lived and died before us,
these people who have worked so much,
we have now bring beautiful things, beautiful gifts, we know so many things.
We can say to our children, OK, done, that was our story. That passed.
Now you have a duty: invent a new story. Invent a new poetry.
The only rule is, we have not to have any idea about the next story.
We give you white pages. Invent.
We give you the best tools, the best tools, and now, do it.
That's why I continue to work, even if it's for toilet brush.
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am
about opening the space frontier.
So when I had the chance to give the world's expert in gravity
the experience of zero gravity, it was incredible.
And I want to tell you that story.
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics.
It's a competition we're holding, the second X PRIZE,
for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days.
We have something called the Genome 100 --
100 individuals we're sequencing as part of that.
Craig Venter chairs that event.
and he said his dream was to travel into space.
And I said, "I can't take you there,
but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g.
And he said, on the spot, "Absolutely, yes."
Well, the only way to experience zero-g on Earth
is actually with parabolic flight, weightless flight.
You take an airplane, you fly over the top, you're weightless for 25 seconds.
Come back down, you weigh twice as much.
You do it again and again.
You can get eight, 10 minutes of weightlessness --
how NASA's trained their astronauts for so long.
We set out to do this.
It took us 11 years to become operational.
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking.
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say,
you're crazy, don't do that, you're going kill the guy.
We worked hard to get all the permissions.
And six months later, we sat down at Kennedy Space Center.
We had a press conference,
we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola,
give him 25 seconds of zero-g.
And if it went really well, we might do three parabolas.
Well, we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this.
And what he said, for me, was very moving.
He said, "Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk
of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space."
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center,
up inside the NASA vehicle, into the back of the zero-g airplane.
we raised $150,000 in donations for children's charities --
who flew with us.
A few TEDsters here.
We set up a whole ER.
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane.
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood, his heart rate, his blood pressure.
We had everything all set in case of an emergency;
God knows, you don't want to hurt this world-renowned expert.
We took off from the shuttle landing facility,
where the shuttle takes off and lands.
carefully suspended him into zero-g.
Once he was there, [we] let him go
to experience what weightlessness was truly like.
And after that first parabola, you know,
the doc said everything is great. He was smiling, and we said go.
So we did a second parabola.
because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge
that Isaac Newton did.
And we did a fourth, and a fifth and a sixth.
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man.
We are living on a precious jewel,
and it's during our lifetime that we're moving off this planet.
Please join us in this epic adventure.
Thank you so much.
There's an ancient and universal concept that words have power,
these little letters are sticky for each other.
you change the three-dimensional folding.
and fold it into whatever shape or pattern you might want.
each one of them binds that long strand in one place,
close together so they stick together.
is to fold the long strand into the shape you're looking for.
you can make a molecule that looks like this.
We want to be able to build technological artifacts
that are maybe good for the world.
So, people argue vigorously about the definition of life.
They ask if it should have reproduction in it, or metabolism, or evolution.
And I don't know the answer to that, so I'm not going to tell you.
I will say that life involves computation.
So this is a computer program.
Booted up in a cell, the program would execute,
and it could result in this person;
or with a small change, it could result in this person;
or another small change, this person;
or with a larger change, this dog,
or this tree, or this whale.
[of] genome as program seriously,
you have to consider that Chris Anderson
is a computer-fabricated artifact, as is Jim Watson,
Craig Venter, as are all of us.
And in convincing yourself that this metaphor is true,
there are lots of similarities between genetic programs
and computer programs that could help to convince you.
But one, to me, that's most compelling
is the peculiar sensitivity to small changes
that can make large changes in biological development -- the output.
A small mutation can take a two-wing fly
and make it a four-wing fly.
Or it could take a fly and put legs where its antennae should be.
Or if you're familiar with "The Princess Bride,"
it could create a six-fingered man.
is just this kind of sensitivity to small changes.
If your bank account's one dollar, and you flip a single bit,
you could end up with a thousand dollars.
So these small changes are things that I think
that -- they indicate to us that a complicated computation
in development is underlying these amplified, large changes.
and it shows the power of molecular programs -- biology does.
And what I want to do is write molecular programs,
potentially to build technology.
And there are a lot of people doing this,
a lot of synthetic biologists doing this, like Craig Venter.
And they concentrate on using cells.
They're cell-oriented.
So my friends, molecular programmers, and I
have a sort of biomolecule-centric approach.
We're interested in using DNA, RNA and protein,
and building new languages for building things from the bottom up,
using biomolecules,
potentially having nothing to do with biology.
So, these are all the machines in a cell.
There's a camera.
There's the solar panels of the cell,
some switches that turn your genes on and off,
the girders of the cell, motors that move your muscles.
My little group of molecular programmers
are trying to refashion all of these parts from DNA.
We're not DNA zealots, but DNA is the cheapest,
easiest to understand and easy to program material to do this.
And as other things become easier to use --
maybe protein -- we'll work with those.
You're going to sit in front of your computer.
You're going to design something like a cell phone,
and in a high-level language, you'll describe that cell phone.
Then you're going to have a compiler
that's going to take that description
and it's going to turn it into actual molecules
that can be sent to a synthesizer
and that synthesizer will pack those molecules into a seed.
And what happens if you water and feed that seed appropriately,
is it will do a developmental computation,
a molecular computation, and it'll build an electronic computer.
I think that life has been about molecular computers
building electrochemical computers,
building electronic computers,
which together with electrochemical computers
will build new molecular computers,
which will build new electronic computers, and so forth.
and you think life is about computation, as I do,
then you look at big questions through the eyes of a computer scientist.
So one big question is, how does a baby know when to stop growing?
And for molecular programming,
the question is how does your cell phone know when to stop growing?
(Laughter)
Or how does a computer program know when to stop running?
Or more to the point, how do you know if a program will ever stop?
There are other questions like this, too.
One of them is Craig Venter's question.
Turns out I think he's actually a computer scientist.
He asked, how big is the minimal genome
that will give me a functioning microorganism?
How few genes can I use?
This is exactly analogous to the question,
what's the smallest program I can write
that will act exactly like Microsoft Word?
(Laughter)
And just as he's writing, you know, bacteria that will be smaller,
he's writing genomes that will work,
we could write smaller programs
that would do what Microsoft Word does.
how many molecules do we need to put in that seed to get a cell phone?
What's the smallest number we can get away with?
Now, these are big questions in computer science.
These are all complexity questions,
and computer science tells us that these are very hard questions.
Almost -- many of them are impossible.
But for some tasks, we can start to answer them.
So, I'm going to start asking those questions
for the DNA structures I'm going to talk about next.
So, this is normal DNA, what you think of as normal DNA.
It's double-stranded, it's a double helix,
has the As, Ts, Cs and Gs that pair to hold the strands together.
And I'm going to draw it like this sometimes,
just so I don't scare you.
We want to look at individual strands and not think about the double helix.
When we synthesize it, it comes single-stranded,
so we can take the blue strand in one tube
and make an orange strand in the other tube,
and they're floppy when they're single-stranded.
You mix them together and they make a rigid double helix.
Now for the last 25 years,
Ned Seeman and a bunch of his descendants
have worked very hard and made beautiful three-dimensional structures
using this kind of reaction of DNA strands coming together.
But a lot of their approaches, though elegant, take a long time.
They can take a couple of years, or it can be difficult to design.
I call DNA origami
that's so easy you could do it at home in your kitchen
and design the stuff on a laptop.
But to do it, you need a long, single strand of DNA,
which is technically very difficult to get.
So, you can go to a natural source.
You can look in this computer-fabricated artifact,
and he's got a double-stranded genome -- that's no good.
You look in his intestines. There are billions of bacteria.
They're no good either.
Double strand again, but inside them, they're infected with a virus
that has a nice, long, single-stranded genome
that we can fold like a piece of paper.
And here's how we do it.
We add a bunch of short, synthetic DNAs that I call staples.
Each one has a left half that binds the long strand in one place,
and a right half that binds it in a different place,
and brings the long strand together like this.
The net action of many of these on that long strand
is to fold it into something like a rectangle.
but Shawn Douglas at Harvard
has made a nice visualization for us
that begins with a long strand and has some short strands in it.
And what happens is that we mix these strands together.
We heat them up, we add a little bit of salt,
we heat them up to almost boiling and cool them down,
and as we cool them down,
the short strands bind the long strands
and start to form structure.
And you can see a little bit of double helix forming there.
When you look at DNA origami,
you can see that what it really is,
even though you think it's complicated,
is a bunch of double helices that are parallel to each other,
and they're held together
by places where short strands go along one helix
and then jump to another one.
So there's a strand that goes like this, goes along one helix and binds --
it jumps to another helix and comes back.
That holds the long strand like this.
that we wanted, I tried to make this shape.
I wanted to fold DNA into something that goes up over the eye,
down the nose, up the nose, around the forehead,
back down and end in a little loop like this.
And so, I thought, if this could work, anything could work.
So I had the computer program design the short staples to do this.
I ordered them; they came by FedEx.
I mixed them up, heated them, cooled them down,
and I got 50 billion little smiley faces
floating around in a single drop of water.
And each one of these is just
one-thousandth the width of a human hair, OK?
you have to get them on a surface where they stick.
So, you pour them out onto a surface
and they start to stick to that surface,
and we take a picture using an atomic-force microscope.
It's got a needle, like a record needle,
that goes back and forth over the surface,
bumps up and down, and feels the height of the first surface.
It feels the DNA origami.
There's the atomic-force microscope working
and you can see that the landing's a little rough.
When you zoom in, they've got, you know,
weak jaws that flip over their heads
and some of their noses get punched out, but it's pretty good.
You can zoom in and even see the extra little loop,
this little nano-goatee.
And so, I got this in the mail about a year after I did this, unsolicited.
Anyone know what this is? What is it?
It's China, right?
So, what happened is, a graduate student in China,
Lulu Qian, did a great job.
She wrote all her own software
to design and built this DNA origami,
a beautiful rendition of China, which even has Taiwan,
and you can see it's sort of on the world's shortest leash, right?
(Laughter)
and you can make patterns as well as shapes, OK?
And you can make a map of the Americas and spell DNA with DNA.
well, actually, this all looks like nano-artwork,
but it turns out that nano-artwork
is just what you need to make nano-circuits.
So, you can put circuit components on the staples,
like a light bulb and a light switch.
Let the thing assemble, and you'll get some kind of a circuit.
And then you can maybe wash the DNA away and have the circuit left over.
So, this is what some colleagues of mine at Caltech did.
They took a DNA origami, organized some carbon nano-tubes,
made a little switch, you see here, wired it up,
tested it and showed that it is indeed a switch.
Now, this is just a single switch
and you need half a billion for a computer, so we have a long way to go.
But this is very promising
because the origami can organize parts just one-tenth the size
of those in a normal computer.
So it's very promising for making small computers.
So, you start with something in the computer.
You get a high-level description of the computer program,
a high-level description of the origami.
You can compile it to molecules, send it to a synthesizer,
and it actually works.
And it turns out that a company has made a nice program
that's much better than my code, which was kind of ugly,
and will allow us to do this in a nice,
visual, computer-aided design way.
why isn't DNA origami the end of the story?
You have your molecular compiler, you can do whatever you want.
The fact is that it does not scale.
So if you want to build a human from DNA origami,
the problem is, you need a long strand
that's 10 trillion trillion bases long.
That's three light years' worth of DNA,
so we're not going to do this.
We're going to turn to another technology,
called algorithmic self-assembly of tiles.
It was started by Erik Winfree,
and what it does,
it has tiles that are a hundredth the size of a DNA origami.
You zoom in, there are just four DNA strands
and they have little single-stranded bits on them
that can bind to other tiles, if they match.
And we like to draw these tiles as little squares.
And if you look at their sticky ends, these little DNA bits,
you can see that they actually form a checkerboard pattern.
So, these tiles would make a complicated, self-assembling checkerboard.
And the point of this, if you didn't catch that,
is that tiles are a kind of molecular program
and they can output patterns.
And a really amazing part of this is
that any computer program can be translated
into one of these tile programs -- specifically, counting.
So, you can come up with a set of tiles
that when they come together, form a little binary counter
rather than a checkerboard.
So you can read off binary numbers five, six and seven.
you need some kind of input, a kind of seed.
You can use DNA origami for that.
You can encode the number 32
in the right-hand side of a DNA origami,
and when you add those tiles that count,
they will start to count -- they will read that 32
and they'll stop at 32.
So, what we've done is we've figured out a way
to have a molecular program know when to stop going.
It knows when to stop growing because it can count.
It knows how big it is.
So, that answers that sort of first question I was talking about.
It doesn't tell us how babies do it, however.
than DNA origami could otherwise.
Here's the DNA origami, and what we can do
is we can write 32 on both edges of the DNA origami,
and we can now use our watering can
and water with tiles, and we can start growing tiles off of that
and create a square.
The counter serves as a template
to fill in a square in the middle of this thing.
So, what we've done is we've succeeded
in making something much bigger than a DNA origami
by combining DNA origami with tiles.
And the neat thing about it is, is that it's also reprogrammable.
You can just change a couple of the DNA strands in this binary representation
and you'll get 96 rather than 32.
And if you do that, the origami's the same size,
but the resulting square that you get is three times bigger.
what I was telling you about development.
You have a very sensitive computer program
where small changes -- single, tiny, little mutations --
can take something that made one size square
and make something very much bigger.
Now, this -- using counting to compute
and build these kinds of things
by this kind of developmental process
is something that also has bearing on Craig Venter's question.
So, you can ask, how many DNA strands are required
to build a square of a given size?
If we wanted to make a square of size 10, 100 or 1,000,
if we used DNA origami alone,
we would require a number of DNA strands that's the square
of the size of that square;
so we'd need 100, 10,000 or a million DNA strands.
That's really not affordable.
But if we use a little computation --
we use origami, plus some tiles that count --
then we can get away with using 100, 200 or 300 DNA strands.
And so we can exponentially reduce the number of DNA strands we use,
if we use counting, if we use a little bit of computation.
And so computation is some very powerful way
to reduce the number of molecules you need to build something,
to reduce the size of the genome that you're building.
about computers building computers.
If you look at the square that you build with the origami
and some counters growing off it,
the pattern that it has is exactly the pattern that you need
to make a memory.
So if you affix some wires and switches to those tiles --
rather than to the staple strands, you affix them to the tiles --
then they'll self-assemble the somewhat complicated circuits,
the demultiplexer circuits, that you need to address this memory.
So you can actually make a complicated circuit
using a little bit of computation.
It's a molecular computer building an electronic computer.
Now, you ask me, how far have we gotten down this path?
Experimentally, this is what we've done in the last year.
Here is a DNA origami rectangle,
and here are some tiles growing from it.
And you can see how they count.
One, two, three, four, five, six, nine, 10, 11, 12, 17.
So it's got some errors, but at least it counts up.
(Laughter)
and that's about the time constant for how long it takes
to do these kinds of things, so I think we made a lot of progress.
We've got ideas about how to fix these errors.
And I think in the next five or 10 years,
we'll make the kind of squares that I described
and maybe even get to some of those self-assembled circuits.
I want you to remember that
to create life's very diverse and complex forms,
life uses computation to do that.
And the computations that it uses, they're molecular computations,
and in order to understand this and get a better handle on it,
as Feynman said, you know,
we need to build something to understand it.
And so we are going to use molecules and refashion this thing,
rebuild everything from the bottom up,
using DNA in ways that nature never intended,
using DNA origami,
and DNA origami to seed this algorithmic self-assembly.
hopefully from some of those big questions,
is that this molecular programming isn't just about making gadgets.
It's not just making about --
it's making self-assembled cell phones and circuits.
What it's really about is taking computer science
and looking at big questions in a new light,
asking new versions of those big questions
and trying to understand how biology
(Applause)
What I'd like to do is just drag us all down into the gutter,
and actually all the way down into the sewer
because I want to talk about diarrhea.
And in particular, I want to talk about
the design of diarrhea.
And when evolutionary biologists talk about design,
they really mean design by natural selection.
And that brings me to the title of the talk,
"Using Evolution to Design Disease Organisms Intelligently."
And I also have a little bit of a sort of smartass subtitle to this.
But I'm not just doing this to be cute.
I really think that this subtitle explains
what somebody like me, who's sort of a Darwin wannabe,
how they actually look at one's role in
sort of coming into this field of health sciences and medicine.
It's really not a very friendly field for evolutionary biologists.
You actually see a great potential,
but you see a lot of people who are sort of defending their turf,
and may actually be very resistant, when one tries
to introduce ideas.
One is that, why are some disease organisms more harmful?
about diarrheal disease organisms.
And the focus when I'm talking about the diarrheal organisms,
as well as the focus when I'm talking about any organisms
that cause acute infectious disease,
is to think about the problem from a germ's point of view,
germ's-eye view.
And in particular, to think about a fundamental idea
which I think makes sense out of a tremendous amount of variation
in the harmfulness of disease organisms.
And that idea is that from the germ's-eye point of view,
disease organisms have to get from one host to another,
and often they have to rely on the well-being of the host
to move them to another host.
And when you have that, then evolutionary theory tells us
that natural selection will favor the more exploitative,
more predator-like organisms.
So, natural selection will favor organisms
that are more likely to cause damage.
If instead transmission to another host requires host mobility,
then we expect that the winners of the competition
will be the milder organisms.
So, if the pathogen doesn't need the host to be healthy and active,
for their own reproductive success.
But if the host needs to be mobile in order to transmit the pathogen,
then it's the benign ones that tend to be the winners.
Diarrheal disease organisms get transmitted in basically three ways.
They can be transmitted from person-to-person contact,
person-to-food-then-to-person contact,
when somebody eats contaminated food,
or they can be transmitted through the water.
And when they're transmitted through the water,
unlike the first two modes of transmission,
of other individuals.
To sort of illustrate that, this diagram emphasizes that
if you've got a sick person in bed,
and then the water may move into sources of drinking water.
when diarrheal disease organisms are transported by water,
we expect them to be more predator-like, more harmful.
And you can test these ideas.
So, one way you can test is just look at all diarrheal bacteria,
and see whether or not the ones that tend to be
more transmitted by water, tend to be more harmful.
And the answer is -- yep, they are.
Now I put those names in there just for the bacteria buffs,
but the main point here is that --
all show a very strong, positive association between
how much death they cause per untreated infection.
So this suggests we're on the right track.
how can we use this knowledge
to make disease organisms evolve to be mild?
the right-hand side of that graph to the left-hand side of the graph.
But it doesn't tell you how long.
I mean, if this would require thousands of years,
then it's worthless in terms of controlling of these pathogens.
But if it could occur in just a few years,
then it might be a very important way to control
domesticate these organisms.
We could make them evolve to be not so harmful to us.
which is the El Tor biotype of the organism called Vibrio cholerae.
And that is the species of organism that is responsible
for causing cholera.
And the reason I thought this is a really great organism to look at
is that we understand why it's so harmful.
It's harmful because it produces a toxin,
and that toxin is released when the organism
gets into our intestinal tract.
It causes fluid to flow from the cells that line our intestine
into the lumen, the internal chamber of our intestine,
and then that fluid goes the only way it can, which is out the other end.
And it flushes out thousands of different other competitors
that would otherwise make life difficult for the Vibrios.
After a few days of infection you end up having --
the fecal material really isn't so disgusting as we might imagine.
It's sort of cloudy water.
And if you took a drop of that water,
you might find a million diarrheal organisms.
If the organism produced a lot of toxin,
you might find 10 million, or 100 million.
If it didn't produce a lot of this toxin,
then you might find a smaller number.
So the task is to try to figure out
how to determine whether or not you could get an organism like this
to evolve towards mildness by blocking waterborne transmission,
thereby allowing the organism only to be transmitted
by person-to-person contact,
or person-food-person contact --
both of which would really require that people be
mobile and fairly healthy for transmission.
One would be to take a lot of different strains of this organism --
some that produce a lot of toxins, some that produce a little --
and take those strains and spew them out in different countries.
Some countries that might have clean water supplies,
so that you can't get waterborne transmission:
you expect the organism to evolve to mildness there.
Other countries, in which you've got a lot of waterborne transmission,
there you expect these organisms to evolve
towards a high level of harmfulness, right?
There's a little ethical problem in this experiment.
I was hoping to hear a few gasps at least.
That makes me worry a little bit.
And this ethical problem's a big problem.
Just to emphasize this, this is what we're really talking about.
Here's a girl who's almost dead.
She got rehydration therapy, she perked up,
within a few days she was looking like a completely different person.
So, we don't want to run an experiment like that.
But interestingly, just that thing happened in 1991.
In 1991, this cholera organism got into Lima, Peru,
and within two months it had spread to the neighboring areas.
Now, I don't know how that happened,
and I didn't have anything to do with it, I promise you.
I don't think anybody knows,
but I'm not averse to, once that's happened,
to see whether or not the prediction that we would make,
that I did make before, actually holds up.
Did the organism evolve to mildness in a place like Chile,
which has some of the most well protected water supplies
in Latin America?
And did it evolve to be more harmful in a place like Ecuador,
which has some of the least well protected?
And Peru's got something sort of in between.
I got a lot of strains from these different countries
and we measured their toxin production in the lab.
And we found that in Chile -- within two months of the invasion of Peru
you had strains entering Chile --
and when you look at those strains,
in the very far left-hand side of this graph,
you see a lot of variation in the toxin production.
Each dot corresponds to an islet from a different person --
a lot of variation on which natural selection can act.
But the interesting point is, if you look over the 1990s,
within a few years the organisms evolved to be more mild.
They evolved to produce less toxin.
And to just give you a sense of how important this might be,
if we look in 1995, we find that there's only one case of cholera,
on average, reported from Chile every two years.
That's how much we have in America,
cholera that's acquired endemically,
and we don't think we've got a problem here.
They didn't -- they solved the problem in Chile.
But, before we get too confident, we'd better look at some of those other countries,
and make sure that this organism doesn't just always evolve toward mildness.
Well, in Peru it didn't.
And in Ecuador -- remember, this is the place where it has
the highest potential waterborne transmission --
it looked like it got more harmful.
In every case there's a lot of variation,
but something about the environment the people are living in,
and I think the only realistic explanation is that it's
the degree of waterborne transmission,
favored the harmful strains in one place, and mild strains in another.
it suggests that something that we might want to do anyhow,
if we had enough money, could actually give us a much bigger bang for the buck.
It would make these organisms evolve to mildness,
so that even though people might be getting infected,
they'd be infected with mild strains.
It wouldn't be causing severe disease.
But there's another really interesting aspect of this,
and this is that if you could control the evolution of virulence,
evolution of harmfulness,
then you should be able to control antibiotic resistance.
And the idea is very simple.
If you've got a harmful organism,
a high proportion of the people are going to be symptomatic,
a high proportion of the people are going to be going to get antibiotics.
You've got a lot of pressure favoring antibiotic resistance,
so you get increased virulence leading to
the evolution of increased antibiotic resistance.
And once you get increased antibiotic resistance,
the antibiotics aren't knocking out the harmful strains anymore.
So, you've got a higher level of virulence.
The goal is to turn this around.
If you could cause an evolutionary decrease in virulence
by cleaning up the water supply,
you should be able to get an evolutionary decrease
in antibiotic resistance.
So, we can go to the same countries and look and see.
Did Chile avoid the problem of antibiotic resistance,
whereas did Ecuador actually have the beginnings of the problem?
If we look in the beginning of the 1990s,
we see, again, a lot of variation.
In this case, on the Y-axis, we've just got a measure of antibiotic sensitivity --
and I won't go into that.
But we've got a lot of variation in antibiotic sensitivity in Chile,
Peru and Ecuador, and no trend across the years.
But if we look at the end of the 1990s, just half a decade later,
we see that in Ecuador they started having a resistance problem.
Antibiotic sensitivity was going down.
And in Chile, you still had antibiotic sensitivity.
They got the organism to evolve to mildness,
and they got no development of antibiotic resistance.
Now, these ideas should apply across the board,
as long as you can figure out why some organisms evolved to virulence.
And I want to give you just one more example,
because we've talked a little bit about malaria.
And the example I want to deal with is,
or the idea I want to deal with, the question is,
what can we do to try to get the malarial organism to evolve to mildness?
Now, malaria's transmitted by a mosquito,
and normally if you're infected with malaria, and you're feeling sick,
it makes it even easier for the mosquito to bite you.
that vector-borne diseases are more harmful
than non-vector-borne diseases.
But I think there's a really fascinating example
of what one can do experimentally to try to actually demonstrate this.
In the case of waterborne transmission,
we'd like to clean up the water supplies,
see whether or not we can get those organisms to evolve towards mildness.
In the case of malaria, what we'd like to do is mosquito-proof houses.
And the logic's a little more subtle here.
If you mosquito-proof houses,
when people get sick, they're sitting in bed --
or in mosquito-proof hospitals, they're sitting in a hospital bed --
and the mosquitoes can't get to them.
in a place where you've got mosquito-proof housing, then you're a loser.
The only pathogens that get transmitted
are the ones that are infecting people that feel healthy enough
to walk outside and get mosquito bites.
So, if you were to mosquito proof houses,
you should be able to get these organisms to evolve to mildness.
And there's a really wonderful experiment that was done
that suggests that we really should go ahead and do this.
And that experiment was done in Northern Alabama.
Just to give you a little perspective on this,
I've given you a star at the intellectual center of the United States,
which is right there in Louisville, Kentucky.
And this really cool experiment was done
about 200 miles south of there, in Northern Alabama,
by the Tennessee Valley Authority.
They had dammed up the Tennessee River.
They'd caused the water to back up,
they needed electric, hydroelectric power.
And when you get stagnant water, you get mosquitoes.
They found in the late '30s -- 10 years after they'd made these dams --
that the people in Northern Alabama were infected with malaria,
about a third to half of them were infected with malaria.
OK, so the Tennessee Valley Authority was in a little bit of a bind.
There wasn't DDT, there wasn't chloroquines: what do they do?
Well, they decided to mosquito proof every house in Northern Alabama.
So they did. They divided Northern Alabama into 11 zones,
and within three years, about 100 dollars per house,
they mosquito proofed every house.
And these are the data.
Every row across here represents one of those 11 zones.
And the asterisks represent the time at which
the mosquito proofing was complete.
And so what you can see is that
just the mosquito-proofed housing, and nothing else,
caused the eradication of malaria.
And this was, incidentally, published in 1949,
in the leading textbook of malaria, called "Boyd's Malariology."
But almost no malaria experts even know it exists.
This is important,
because it tells us that if you have moderate biting densities,
you can eradicate malaria by mosquito proofing houses.
Like, you know, just as you get into the malaria zone,
sub-Saharan Africa.
But as you move to really intense biting rate areas, like Nigeria,
you're certainly not going to eradicate.
But that's when you should be favoring evolution towards mildness.
So to me, it's an experiment that's waiting to happen,
and if it confirms the prediction, then
we should have a very powerful tool.
In a way, much more powerful than the kind of tools we're looking at,
because most of what's being done today is
to rely on things like anti-malarial drugs.
And we know that, although it's great to make those
anti-malarial drugs available at really low cost and high frequency,
we know that when you make them highly available
you're going to get resistance to those drugs.
And so it's a short-term solution.
This is a long-term solution.
working in the direction we want it to go,
rather than always having to battle evolution as a problem
that stymies our efforts to control the pathogen,
for example with anti-malarial drugs.
So, this table I've given just to emphasize
that I've only talked about two examples.
But as I said earlier, this kind of logic applies across the board
for infectious diseases, and it ought to.
Because when we're dealing with infectious diseases, we're dealing with living systems.
We're dealing with living systems;
we're dealing with systems that evolve.
And so if you do something with those systems,
they're going to evolve one way or another.
And all I'm saying is that we need to figure out how they'll evolve,
so that -- we need to adjust our interventions
to get the most bang for the intervention buck,
so that we can get these organisms to evolve in the direction we want them to go.
but I did want to put them up there,
just to give you a sense that there really are solutions
to controlling the evolution of harmfulness
of some of the nasty pathogens that we're confronted with.
And this links up with a lot of the other ideas that have been talked about.
So, for example, earlier today there was discussion of,
how do you really lower sexual transmission of HIV?
What this emphasizes is that we need to figure out how it will work.
Will it maybe get lowered if we alter the economy of the area?
It may get lowered if we intervene in ways that
encourage people to stay more faithful to partners, and so on.
because if we lower it, we'll get an evolutionary change in the virus.
And the data really do support this:
that you actually do get the virus evolving towards mildness.
And that will just add to the effectiveness of our control efforts.
So the other thing I really like about this,
besides the fact that it brings a whole new dimension
into the study of control of disease,
is that often the kinds of interventions that you want,
that it indicates should be done,
are the kinds of interventions that people want anyhow.
But people just haven't been able to justify the cost.
If we know that we're going to get extra bang for the buck from providing clean water,
then I think that we can say,
let's push the effort into that aspect of the control,
so that we can actually solve the problem,
even though, if you just look at the frequency of infection,
you would suggest that you can't solve the problem well enough
just by cleaning up water supply.
Anyhow, I'll end that there, and thank you very much.
As a particle physicist, I study the elementary particles
and how they interact on the most fundamental level.
For most of my research career, I've been using accelerators,
such as the electron accelerator at Stanford University, just up the road,
to study things on the smallest scale.
But more recently, I've been turning my attention
to the universe on the largest scale.
Because, as I'll explain to you,
the questions on the smallest and the largest scale are actually very connected.
So I'm going to tell you about our twenty-first-century view of the universe,
what it's made of and what the big questions in the physical sciences are --
at least some of the big questions.
that the ordinary matter in the universe --
and by ordinary matter, I mean you, me,
the planets, the stars, the galaxies --
the ordinary matter makes up only a few percent
of the content of the universe.
Almost a quarter, or approximately a quarter
of the matter in the universe, is stuff that's invisible.
By invisible, I mean it doesn't absorb in the electromagnetic spectrum.
It doesn't emit in the electromagnetic spectrum. It doesn't reflect.
It doesn't interact with the electromagnetic spectrum,
which is what we use to detect things.
It doesn't interact at all. So how do we know it's there?
We know it's there by its gravitational effects.
In fact, this dark matter dominates
the gravitational effects in the universe on a large scale,
and I'll be telling you about the evidence for that.
The rest of the pie is a very mysterious substance called dark energy.
More about that later, OK.
So for now, let's turn to the evidence for dark matter.
In these galaxies, especially in a spiral galaxy like this,
most of the mass of the stars is concentrated in the middle of the galaxy.
This huge mass of all these stars keeps stars in circular orbits in the galaxy.
So we have these stars going around in circles like this.
As you can imagine, even if you know physics, this should be intuitive, OK --
that stars that are closer to the mass in the middle will be rotating at a higher speed
than those that are further out here, OK.
that they should be slower on the edges than on the inside.
In other words, if we measured speed as a function of distance --
this is the only time I'm going to show a graph, OK --
we would expect that it goes down as the distance increases
from the center of the galaxy.
When those measurements are made,
instead what we find is that the speed is basically constant,
as a function of distance.
If it's constant, that means that the stars out here
are feeling the gravitational effects of matter that we do not see.
In fact, this galaxy and every other galaxy
appears to be embedded in a cloud of this invisible dark matter.
And this cloud of matter is much more spherical than the galaxy themselves,
and it extends over a much wider range than the galaxy.
So we see the galaxy and fixate on that, but it's actually a cloud of dark matter
that's dominating the structure and the dynamics of this galaxy.
they tend to cluster.
And this is an example of a very, actually, famous cluster, the Coma cluster.
And there are thousands of galaxies in this cluster.
They're the white, fuzzy, elliptical things here.
So these galaxy clusters -- we take a snapshot now,
we take a snapshot in a decade, it'll look identical.
But these galaxies are actually moving at extremely high speeds.
They're moving around in this gravitational potential well of this cluster, OK.
So all of these galaxies are moving.
We can measure the speeds of these galaxies, their orbital velocities,
and figure out how much mass is in this cluster.
than can be accounted for by the galaxies that we see.
Or if we look in other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum,
we see that there's a lot of gas in this cluster, as well.
But that cannot account for the mass either.
In fact, there appears to be about ten times as much mass here
in the form of this invisible or dark matter
as there is in the ordinary matter, OK.
It would be nice if we could see this dark matter a little bit more directly.
I'm just putting this big, blue blob on there, OK,
to try to remind you that it's there.
Can we see it more visually? Yes, we can.
So here's an observer:
it could be an eye; it could be a telescope.
And suppose there's a galaxy out here in the universe.
How do we see that galaxy?
A ray of light leaves the galaxy and travels through the universe
for perhaps billions of years
before it enters the telescope or your eye.
Now, how do we deduce where the galaxy is?
Well, we deduce it by the direction that the ray is traveling
as it enters our eye, right?
We say, the ray of light came this way;
the galaxy must be there, OK.
Now, suppose I put in the middle a cluster of galaxies --
and don't forget the dark matter, OK.
Now, if we consider a different ray of light, one going off like this,
we now need to take into account
what Einstein predicted when he developed general relativity.
And that was that the gravitational field, due to mass,
will deflect not only the trajectory of particles,
but will deflect light itself.
but would rather bend and could end up going into our eye.
Where will this observer see the galaxy?
You can respond. Up, right?
We extrapolate backwards and say the galaxy is up here.
Is there any other ray of light
that could make into the observer's eye from that galaxy?
Yes, great. I see people going down like this.
So a ray of light could go down, be bent
up into the observer's eye,
and the observer sees a ray of light here.
a three-dimensional universe, OK,
a three-dimensional space.
Are there any other rays of light that could make it into the eye?
Yes! The rays would lie on a -- I'd like to see -- yeah, on a cone.
So there's a whole ray of light -- rays of light on a cone --
that will all be bent by that cluster
and make it into the observer's eye.
If there is a cone of light coming into my eye, what do I see?
A circle, a ring. It's called an Einstein ring. Einstein predicted that, OK.
Now, it will only be a perfect ring if the source, the deflector
and the eyeball, in this case, are all in a perfectly straight line.
If they're slightly skewed, we'll see a different image.
to figure out what that image will look like.
Because it turns out that there is a kind of lens that we can devise,
that has the right shape to produce this kind of effect.
We call this gravitational lensing.
And so, this is your instrument, OK.
(Laughter).
But ignore the top part.
It's the base that I want you to concentrate, OK.
So, actually, at home, whenever we break a wineglass,
I save the bottom, take it over to the machine shop.
We shave it off, and I have a little gravitational lens, OK.
So it's got the right shape to produce the lensing.
And so the next thing you need to do in your experiment
is grab a napkin. I grabbed a piece of graph paper -- I'm a physicist. (Laughter)
So, a napkin. Draw a little model galaxy in the middle.
And now put the lens over the galaxy,
and what you'll find is that you'll see a ring, an Einstein ring.
Now, move the base off to the side,
and the ring will split up into arcs, OK.
And you can put it on top of any image.
On the graph paper, you can see
how all the lines on the graph paper have been distorted.
And again, this is a kind of an accurate model
of what happens with the gravitational lensing.
Do we see arcs in the sky when we look at, say, a cluster of galaxies?
And the answer is yes.
And so, here's an image from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Many of the images you are seeing
are earlier from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Well, first of all, for the golden shape galaxies --
those are the galaxies in the cluster.
They're the ones that are embedded in that sea of dark matter
that are causing the bending of the light
to cause these optical illusions, or mirages, practically,
of the background galaxies.
So the streaks that you see, all these streaks,
are actually distorted images of galaxies that are much further away.
we see in those images, we can calculate how much mass
there must be in this cluster.
And it's an enormous amount of mass.
And also, you can tell by eye, by looking at this,
that these arcs are not centered on individual galaxies.
They are centered on some more spread out structure,
and that is the dark matter
in which the cluster is embedded, OK.
So this is the closest you can get to kind of seeing
at least the effects of the dark matter with your naked eye.
So the evidence that we have
that a quarter of the universe is dark matter --
this gravitationally attracting stuff --
is that galaxies, the speed with which stars orbiting galaxies
is much too large; it must be embedded in dark matter.
The speed with which galaxies within clusters are orbiting is much too large;
it must be embedded in dark matter.
And we see these gravitational lensing effects, these distortions
that say that, again, clusters are embedded in dark matter.
So to understand the evidence for dark energy, we need to discuss something
that Stephen Hawking referred to in the previous session.
And that is the fact that space itself is expanding.
So if we imagine a section of our infinite universe --
and so I've put down four spiral galaxies, OK --
and imagine that you put down a set of tape measures,
so every line on here corresponds to a tape measure,
horizontal or vertical, for measuring where things are.
If you could do this, what you would find
that with each passing day, each passing year,
each passing billions of years, OK,
the distance between galaxies is getting greater.
And it's not because galaxies are moving
away from each other through space.
They're not necessarily moving through space.
They're moving away from each other
because space itself is getting bigger, OK.
That's what the expansion of the universe or space means.
So they're moving further apart.
is that after the Big Bang, space expanded at a very rapid rate.
But because gravitationally attracting matter
is embedded in this space,
it tends to slow down the expansion of the space, OK.
So the expansion slows down with time.
So, in the last century, OK, people debated
about whether this expansion of space would continue forever;
whether it would slow down, you know,
will be slowing down, but continue forever;
slow down and stop, asymptotically stop;
or slow down, stop, and then reverse, so it starts to contract again.
So a little over a decade ago,
two groups of physicists and astronomers
set out to measure the rate at which
the expansion of space was slowing down, OK.
By how much less is it expanding today,
compared to, say, a couple of billion years ago?
was that space is expanding at a faster rate today
than it was a few billion years ago, OK.
So the expansion of space is actually speeding up.
This was a completely surprising result.
There is no persuasive theoretical argument for why this should happen, OK.
No one was predicting ahead of time this is what's going to be found.
It was the opposite of what was expected.
So we need something to be able to explain that.
Now it turns out, in the mathematics,
you can put it in as a term that's an energy,
from anything we've ever seen before.
We call it dark energy,
and it has this effect of causing space to expand.
But we don't have a good motivation
for putting it in there at this point, OK.
So it's really unexplained as to why we need to put it in.
is that, first of all, dark matter and dark energy
are completely different things, OK.
There are really two mysteries out there as to what makes up most of the universe,
and they have very different effects.
Dark matter, because it gravitationally attracts,
it tends to encourage the growth of structure, OK.
So clusters of galaxies will tend to form,
because of all this gravitational attraction.
Dark energy, on the other hand,
is putting more and more space between the galaxies,
makes it, the gravitational attraction between them decrease,
and so it impedes the growth of structure.
So by looking at things like clusters of galaxies,
and how they -- their number density,
how many there are as a function of time --
we can learn about how dark matter and dark energy
compete against each other in structure forming.
you know, really persuasive argument for dark energy.
Do we have anything for dark matter? And the answer is yes.
We have well-motivated candidates for the dark matter.
Now, what do I mean by well motivated?
I mean that we have mathematically consistent theories
that were actually introduced
to explain a completely different phenomenon, OK,
things that I haven't even talked about,
that each predict the existence
of a very weakly interacting, new particle.
where a prediction comes out of a mathematically consistent theory
that was actually developed for something else.
But we don't know if either of those
are actually the dark matter candidate, OK.
One or both, who knows? Or it could be something completely different.
Now, we look for these dark matter particles
because, after all, they are here in the room, OK,
and they didn't come in the door.
They just pass through anything.
They can come through the building, through the Earth --
they're so non-interacting.
that are extremely sensitive to a dark matter particle coming through and bumping it.
So a crystal that will ring if that happens.
So one of my colleagues up the road and his collaborators
have built such a detector.
And they've put it deep down in an iron mine in Minnesota,
OK, deep under the ground, and in fact, in the last couple of days
announced the most sensitive results so far.
They haven't seen anything, OK, but it puts limits on what the mass
and the interaction strength of these dark matter particles are.
There's going to be a satellite telescope launched later this year
and it will look towards the middle of the galaxy,
to see if we can see dark matter particles annihilating
and producing gamma rays that could be detected with this.
The Large Hadron Collider, a particle physics accelerator,
that we'll be turning on later this year.
It is possible that dark matter particles might be produced
at the Large Hadron Collider.
they will actually escape the detector,
so their signature will be missing energy, OK.
Now, unfortunately, there is a lot of new physics
whose signature could be missing energy,
so it will be hard to tell the difference.
And finally, for future endeavors, there are telescopes being designed
specifically to address the questions of dark matter and dark energy --
ground-based telescopes, and there are three space-based telescopes
that are in competition right now
to be launched to investigate dark matter and dark energy.
So in terms of the big questions:
what is dark matter? What is dark energy?
The big questions facing physics.
And I'm sure you have lots of questions,
which I very much look forward to addressing
over the next 72 hours, while I'm here. Thank you.
(Applause)
Those of us who believe in heaven have some sort of idea of what heaven would be.
We were in Queens,
we were building the big, big, big, big building in Midtown,
but they were very proud
What you find at the store at the corner, without going to any kind of fancy store,
because it's great to work there. You really have power
in that people usually tend to know about your exhibition or see the exhibitions,
and then they stumble upon my show and I keep them there.
in my department have been doing ever since the museum was founded in 1929,
which is to try and see what's going on in the world
There were a lot of programs in architecture and design that were about
Mutant Materials in Contemporary Design.
where I asked different designers to come up with ideas for

current conditions in economy, in materials, in sustainability issues,
and then what they do at the end -- if they are good --
as a half-full glass instead of half-empty --
these kind of water-sterilizing straws,
and some of the entries that you see in his website were actually in the exhibition.

but also sustainability of human interrelationships --
is very much part of the work of so many designers.
which is quite fantastic.
And this other medicine is something that you can draw on your skin,
and I've been bugging a lot of you about this here --
as an instruction, as a direction rather than a prescription of form.
I've sent an email already to quite a few of you.
Well, I'm involved in other things, besides physics.
In fact, mostly now in other things.
And the professional, historical linguists in the U.S.
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away
from any long-distance relationships, big groupings,
groupings that go back a long time,
longer than the familiar families.
They don't like that. They think it's crank. I don't think it's crank.
And there are some brilliant linguists, mostly Russians,
who are working on that, at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow,
and I would love to see where that leads.
some 20, 25,000 years ago?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor,
when there was presumably a competition among many languages?
How far back does that go? How far back does modern language go?
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back?
than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures
and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe,
in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago, or earlier.
I can't believe they did all those things and didn't also have a modern language.
So, I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further.
of today's attested languages couldn't descend perhaps
from one that's much younger than that, like say 20,000 years,
or something of that kind. It's what we call a bottleneck.
You may just know more about everything than anyone.
So, it's been an honor. Thank you Murray Gell-Mann.
(Applause)
It's a simple idea about nature.
I want to say a word for nature
and tell you about a tool, a very simple tool that I have found.
Although it's really nothing more than a literary conceit; it's not a technology.
It's very powerful for, I think, changing our relationship to the natural world
and to the other species on whom we depend.
And that tool is very simply, as Chris suggested,
cutting up potatoes and planting it,
and the bees were working on this tree;
bumblebees, just making this thing vibrate.
is that it doesn't take all your concentration,
you really can't get hurt -- it's not like woodworking --
and both of us -- probably, if I can imagine the bee's point of view --
brought it, and I was planting it.
And that bee, no doubt, assumed that it had decided,
that we are sovereign subjects in nature, the bee as well as me.
I plant the potatoes, I weed the garden, I domesticate the species.
But that day, it occurred to me:
but we know better.
We know that what's going on between the bee and that flower
is that bee has been cleverly manipulated by that flower.
And when I say manipulated, I'm talking about in a Darwinian sense, right?
and also picking up some powder on its leg,
And suddenly mowing the lawn that day was a completely different experience.
And that's what the lawn was.
But then I realized, "No, this is exactly what the grasses want us to do.
I'm a dupe. I'm a dupe of the lawns, whose goal in life is to outcompete the trees,
who they compete with for sunlight."
And so by getting us to mow the lawn, we keep the trees from coming back,
and wrote a whole book about it called "The Botany of Desire."
And I realized that in the same way you can look at a flower
what could we find out about ourselves by doing the same thing?
That a certain kind of potato, a certain kind of drug,
a sativa-indica Cannabis cross has something to say about us.
And that, wouldn't this be kind of an interesting way to look at the world?
is what does it get us?
And when you're talking about nature, which is really my subject as a writer,
how does it meet the Aldo Leopold test?
Which is, does it make us better citizens of the biotic community?
Get us to do things that leads to the support and perpetuation of the biota,
helps us deal with this weird anomaly,
which is -- and this is in the realm of intellectual history --
which is that we have this Darwinian revolution 150 years ago ...
Ugh. Mini-Me. (Laughter)
We have this intellectual, this Darwinian revolution in which, thanks to Darwin,
we figured out we are just one species among many;
evolution is working on us the same way it's working on all the others;
But the weird thing is, we have not absorbed this lesson 150 years later;
who believe that subjectivity, consciousness, sets us apart;
that the world is divided into subjects and objects;
that there is nature on one side, culture on another.
As soon as you start seeing things from the plant's point of view or the animal's point of view,
you realize that the real literary conceit is that --
is the idea that nature is opposed to culture,
the idea that consciousness is everything --
and that's another very important thing it does.
is a cure for the disease of human self-importance.
You suddenly realize that consciousness --
which we value and we consider
the crowning achievement of nature,
And it's kind of natural that we would think it was the best tool.
So when you look at the plants, you realize that there are other tools
and they're just as interesting.
lima beans. You know what a lima bean does when it's attacked by spider mites?
It releases this volatile chemical that goes out into the world
and summons another species of mite
that comes in and attacks the spider mite, defending the lima bean.
Their complexity, their sophistication, is something to really marvel at,
Just to give you grounds for comparison, rice: 35,000 genes.
So who's the more sophisticated species?
help us think ecologically.
and what I learned, in fact, is that we are all, now, being manipulated by corn.
And the talk you heard about ethanol earlier today,
to me, is the final triumph of corn over good sense. (Laughter) (Applause)
It is part of corn's scheme for world domination.
(Laughter)
And you will see, the amount of corn planted this year will be up dramatically from last year
and there will be that much more habitat
because we've decided ethanol is going to help us.
which of course is a Cartesian system.
It's based on this idea that we bend other species to our will
about looking at things from the species' point of view are actually implemented,
that I've ever come across in 25 years of writing about nature.
And that is this:
the farm is called Polyface, which means ...
the idea is he's got six different species of animals, as well as some plants,
growing in this very elaborate symbiotic arrangement.
what else does he have?
All the six different species -- rabbits, actually --
are all performing ecological services for one another,
such that the manure of one is the lunch for the other
and they take care of pests for one another.
It's a very elaborate and beautiful dance,
but I'm going to just give you a close-up on one piece of it,
And this is a lot more than growing food, as you'll see;
this is a different way to think about nature
and a way to get away from the zero-sum notion,
the Cartesian idea that either nature's winning or we're winning,
The only technology involved here is this cheap electric fencing:
relatively new, hooked to a car battery;
even I could carry a quarter-acre paddock, set it up in 15 minutes.
Cows graze one day. They move, OK?
They graze everything down, intensive grazing.
He waits three days,
and then we towed in something called the Eggmobile.
The Eggmobile is a very rickety contraption --
but it houses 350 chickens.
He tows this into the paddock three days later and opens the gangplank,
turns them down, and 350 hens come streaming down the gangplank --
And the reason he's waited three days
And third, while they're in this paddock
they are, of course, defecating madly
and their very nitrogenous manure is fertilizing this field.
And within four or five weeks, he can do it again.
He can graze again, he can cut, he can bring in another species,
like the lambs, or he can make hay for the winter.
20,000 broilers; 1,000 turkeys; 1,000 rabbits --
an immense amount of food.
Well, look how much food you can produce on 100 acres if you do this kind of ...
again, give each species what it wants,
let it realize its desires, its physiological distinctiveness.
Put that in play.
and it immediately does something very interesting.
Any one of you who gardens knows that there is something called the root-shoot ratio,
and plants need to keep the root mass
in some rough balance with the leaf mass to be happy.
So when they lose a lot of leaf mass, they shed roots;
they kind of cauterize them and the roots die.
And the species in the soil go to work
This is how soil is created.
which is still a Cartesian system, more or less.
And what it tells you is that if you begin to take account of other species,
take account of the soil, that even with nothing more than this perspectival idea
-- because there is no technology involved here except for those fences,
What I am always thinking about
is what this session is about, which is called simplicity.
And almost, I would almost call it being simple-minded,
but in the best sense of the word.
I'm trying to figure out two very simple things:
how to live and how to die, period.
That's all I'm trying to do, all day long.
And I'm also trying to have some meals, and have some snacks,
and, you know, and yell at my children, and do all the normal things
that keep you grounded.
My older sister was busy torturing my parents,
and they were busy torturing her.
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored,
which is a fabulous thing, actually, I want to tell you.
So, I was able to completely daydream my way through my life.
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU, at a very good time, in 1967,
where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU.
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him.
And feminists hated us, and the whole thing was wretched
from beginning to end.
But I kept writing bad poetry, and he didn't blow up the math building,
but he went to Cuba.
But I gave him the money, because I was from Riverdale
so I had more money than he did.
(Laughter)
And that was a good thing to help, you know, the cause.
But, then he came back, and things happened,
and I decided I really hated my writing,
that it was awful, awful, purple prose.
And I decided that I wanted to tell --
but I still wanted to tell a narrative story
and I still wanted to tell my stories.
So I decided that I would start to draw. How hard could that be?
And so what happened was that I started
just becoming an editorial illustrator through, you know,
sheer whatever, sheer ignorance.
Well, Tibor really started the studio, called M&Co.
And the premise of M&Co was, we don't know anything,
but that's all right, we're going to do it anyway.
And as a matter of fact, it's better not to know anything,
because if you know too much, you're stymied.
So, the premise in the studio was,
there are no boundaries, there is no fear.
And I -- and my full-time job, I landed the best job on Earth,
was to daydream, and to actually come up with absurd ideas
that -- fortunately, there were enough people there,
and it was a team, it was a collective,
it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas.
But the point was that I was there as myself, as a dreamer.
And so some of the things -- I mean, it was a long history of M&Co,
and clearly we also needed to make some money,
so we decided we would create a series of products.
And some of the watches there,
attempting to be beautiful and humorous --
maybe not attempting, hopefully succeeding.
That to be able to talk about content,
to break apart what you normally expect, to use humor and surprise,
elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us.
It was a very high, it was a very impersonal time in design
and we wanted to say, the content is what's important,
not the package, not the wrapping.
You really have to be journalists, you have to be inventors,
you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything.
and, though I don't know if I believe in luck --
I don't know what I believe in, it's a very complicated question,
but I do know that before I go away, I crank his tail seven times.
So, whenever he sees a suitcase in the house,
because everybody's always, you know, leaving,
they're always cranking this wonderful dog's tail,
and he runs to the other room.
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and --
from working for adults to children, and back and forth,
because, you know, I can say that I'm immature,
and in a way, that's true.
I don't really -- I mean, I could tell you that I didn't understand,
I'm not proud of it, but I didn't understand
let's say 95 percent of the talks at this conference.
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings
and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann's talk.
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham's talk.
So, good things come out of, you know, incomprehension --
(Laughter)
-- which I will do a painting of, and then it will end up in my work.
So, I'm open to the possibilities of not knowing
and finding out something new.
You have to condense a story into 32 pages, usually.
And what you have to do is, you really have to edit down to what you want to say.
And hopefully, you're not talking down to kids
and you're not talking in such a way that you,
you know, couldn't stand reading it after one time.
So, I hopefully am writing, you know,
books that are good for children and for adults.
But the painting reflects --
I don't think differently for children than I do for adults.
I try to use the same kind of imagination, the same kind of whimsy,
the same kind of love of language.
So, you know, and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends.
"You! Sit down there." You know, I take lots of photos.
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair.
So, I get to put in all of the things that I love.
Hopefully, a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels,
and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve.
And the books are really journals of my life.
I never -- I don't like plots.
I don't know what a plot means.
I can't stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning,
you know, beginning, middle and end. It really scares me,
because my life is too random and too confused,
and I enjoy it that way.
and this is our room. And I had this dream
that I was wearing this fantastic green gown,
and I was looking out the window,
and it was really a beautiful thing.
And so, I was able to put that into this story, which is an alphabet,
and hopefully go on to something else.
The letter C had other things in it.
I was fortunate also, to meet the man who's sitting on the bed,
though I gave him hair over here and he doesn't have hair.
Well, he has some hair but -- well, he used to have hair.
And with him, I was able to do a project that was really fantastic.
I work for the New Yorker, and I do covers, and 9/11 happened
and it was, you know, a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it.
and somebody said Bronxistan,
and somebody said Ferreristan,
and we came up with this New Yorker cover,
which we were able to -- we didn't know what we were doing.
We weren't trying to be funny, we weren't trying to be --
well, we were trying to be funny actually, that's not true.
We hoped we'd be funny, but we didn't know it would be a cover,
and we didn't know that that image, at the moment that it happened,
would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people.
And it really became the -- I don't know, you know,
it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on.
And from, you know, Fattushis, to Taxistan to, you know,
for the Fashtoonks, Botoxia, Pashmina, Khlintunisia, you know,
we were able to take the city
and make fun of this completely foreign, who are -- what's going on over here?
Who are these people? What are these tribes?
And David Remnick, who was really wonderful about it,
had one problem. He didn't like Al Zheimers,
because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer's.
But you know, we said, "David, who's going to know?
They're not."
(Laughter)
So it stayed in, and it was, and, you know, it was a good thing.
You know, in the course of my life, I never know what's going to happen
and that's kind of the beauty part.
and I picked up this book, "The Elements of Style," at a yard sale.
And I didn't -- and I'd never used it in school,
because I was too busy writing poems, and flunking out,
and I don't know what, sitting in cafes.
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought, this book is amazing.
I said, people should know about this book.
(Laughter)
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift, it needed a few illustrations.
And basically, I called the, you know, I convinced the White Estate,
and what an intersection of like, you know,
Polish Jew, you know, main WASP family. Here I am, saying,
I'd like to do something to this book.
And they said yes, and they left me completely alone,
which was a gorgeous, wonderful thing.
And I took the examples that they gave,
and just did 56 paintings, basically.
So, this is, I don't know if you can read this.
"Well, Susan, this is a fine mess you are in."
And when you're dealing with grammar,
which is, you know, incredibly dry,
E.B. White wrote such wonderful, whimsical -- and actually, Strunk --
and then you come to the rules and, you know,
there are lots of grammar things. "Do you mind me asking a question?
Do you mind my asking a question?"
"Would, could, should, or would, should, could."
And "would" is Coco Chanel's lover, "should" is Edith Sitwell,
and "could" is an August Sander subject.
And, "He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug."
(Laughter)
that I really love very much.
And then, "Be obscure clearly! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand."
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules,
which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him
for the rest of time, or you can ignore them, which I do,
or you can, I don't know what, you know, eat a sandwich.
So, what I did when I was painting was I started singing,
because I really adore singing,
and I think that music is the highest form of all art.
So, I commissioned a wonderful composer, Nico Muhly,
who wrote nine songs using the text,
and we performed this fantastic evening of --
he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals.
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky
in the main reading room of the New York Public Library,
where you're supposed to be very, very quiet,
and it was a phenomenally wonderful event,
which we hopefully will do some more.
asked me to do a column, and they said, you can do whatever you want.
So, once a month for the last year,
I've been doing a column called "The Principles of Uncertainty,"
which, you know, I don't know who Heisenberg is,
but I know I can throw that around now. You know,
it's the principles of uncertainty, so, you know.
I'm going to read quickly -- and probably I'm going to edit some,
because I don't have that much time left -- a few of the columns.
And basically, I was so, you know, it was so amusing,
because I said, "Well, how much space do I have?"
And they said, "Well, you know, it's the Internet."
And I said, "Yes, but how much space do I have?"
And they said, "It's unlimited, it's unlimited."
OK. So, the first one I was very timid, and I'll begin.
"How can I tell you everything that is in my heart?
Impossible to begin. Enough. No. Begin with the hapless dodo."
And I talk about the dodo, and how the dodo became extinct,
and then I talk about Spinoza.
"As the last dodo was dying, Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation
for everything, called eudaemonia.
And then he breathed his last, with loved ones around him,
and I know that he had chicken soup also, as his last meal."
I happen to know it for a fact.
And then he died, and there was no more Spinoza. Extinct.
but we do have a stuffed Pavlov's dog,
and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg, in Russia.
And there he is, with this horrible electrical box on his rump
in this fantastic, decrepit palace.
"And I think it must have been a very, very dark day
when the Bolsheviks arrived.
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs,
but Stalin was a paranoid man, even more than my father."
(Laughter)
You don't even know.
"And decided his top people had to be extinctified."
Which I think I made up, which is a good thing.
And so, this is a chart of, you know, just a small chart,
because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed.
So, shot dead, smacked over the head, you know, thrown away.
"Nabokov's family fled Russia. How could the young Nabokov,
sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair,
leafing through a book and butterflies,
imagine such displacement, such loss?"
And then I want to tell you that this is a map.
Too many pogroms.
Leaving the shack, the wild blueberry woods, the geese, the River Sluch,
they went to Palestine and then America."
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America,
and that is my DNA over here, because that person who I grew up with
had no use for facts whatsoever.
Facts were actually banished from our home.
And so, if you see that Texas -- you know, Texas and California
are under Canada, and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina,
this is the home that I grew up in, OK?
So, it's a miracle that I'm here today.
But actually, it's not. It's actually a wonderful thing.
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin,
which is the town they came from, and, "Sorry, the rest unknown, thank you."
But in her lexicon, "sorry, the rest unknown, thank you" is
"sorry, the rest unknown, go to hell,"
because she couldn't care less.
(Laughter)
is that February's a really wretched month in New York
and the images for me conjure up these really awful things.
Well, not so awful.
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper
and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead.
And I say, "I hope he's not really dead,
just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow,
but the caption says he is dead."
And actually, he was. I think he's dead, though I don't know,
maybe he's not dead.
"And this woman leans over in anguish, not about that man,
but about all sad things. It happens quite often in February."
There's consoling.
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase,
and basically -- you know, I guess onions are a theme here.
And he says, "It is impossible not to lie.
It is February and not lying is impossible."
And I really spend a lot of time wondering,
how much truth do we tell?
What is it that we're actually -- what story are we actually telling?
How do we know when we are ourselves?
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths
are real stories, you know, are real sentences?
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying?
A quote by Bertrand Russell,
"All the labor of all the ages, all the devotion, all the inspiration,
all the noonday brightness of human genius
are destined to extinction.
So now, my friends, if that is true,
and it is true, what is the point?"
A complicated question.
And so, you know, I talk to my friends
and I go to plays where they're singing Russian songs.
Oh my God, you know what?
Could we have -- no, we don't have time.
I taped my aunt. I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the --
you know, could we have it for a second?
Do you have that?
(Music)
OK. I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean
every day of the year until she was about 85.
So -- and that's a song about how everybody's miserable
because, you know, we're from Russia.
(Laughter)
and when I brought her a copy of "The Elements of Style,"
she said she would treasure it.
And then I said -- oh, and she was talking about Moss Hart, and I said,
"When you met him, you knew it was him."
And she said, "I knew it was he."
(Laughter)
So, I was the one who should have kept the book, but it was a really wonderful moment.
And she dated George Gershwin, so, you know, get out.
Gershwin died at the age of 38.
He's buried in the same cemetery as my husband.
I don't want to talk about that now.
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake
is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby.
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate.
(Laughter)
And I would like to run it for them.
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise,
who's also still working, and I looked at her sink,
which is really amazing, and left.
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street.
And a woman who lives on our street, Lolita.
And then I go and have some tea.
And then my Aunt Frances dies, and before she died,
she tried to pay with Sweet'N Low packets for her bagel.
(Laughter)
And I wonder what the point is and then I know, and I see
that Hy Meyerowitz, Rick Meyerowitz's father,
a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx,
won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931.
That's actually Hy.
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit,
and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine.
And it says, "Ich habe genug," which is a Bach cantata,
which I once thought meant "I've had it, I can't take it anymore,
give me a break," but I was wrong.
It means "I have enough." And that is utterly true.
I happen to be alive, end of discussion. Thank you.
(Applause)
Who are we?
That is the big question.
super-intelligent ape.
This could be us.
We belong to the family called the Hominidae.
in terms of our place in the world today
that exist on planet Earth today.
that have ever lived on the planet in past times.
We're one species out of approximately,
or let's say, at least 16 upright-walking apes
that exists on planet Earth today, except for the bonobos.
And we share our origins with a handful of the living great apes.
with the gorillas, the chimpanzee and also the bonobos.
We have a common past, and we have a common future.
And it is important to remember that all of these great apes
have come on as long and as interesting evolutionary journey
as we ourselves have today.
And it's this journey that is of such interest to humanity,
and it's this journey that has been the focus
of the past three generations of my family,
as we've been in East Africa looking for the fossil remains
of our ancestors to try and piece together our evolutionary past.
A group of dedicated young men and women walk very slowly
out across vast areas of Africa,
looking for small fragments of bone, fossil bone, that may be on the surface.
And that's an example of what we may do as we walk across
the landscape in Northern Kenya, looking for fossils.
I doubt many of you in the audience can see
the fossil that's in this picture,
but if you look very carefully, there is a jaw, a lower jaw,
of a 4.1-million-year-old upright-walking ape
as it was found at Lake Turkana on the west side.
(Laughter)
It's extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive
and it is something that is going to involve a lot more people,
to begin to piece together our past.
We still really haven't got a very complete picture of it.
Today, we've got great technology: we have GPS.
We mark it with a GPS fix,
and we also take a digital photograph of the specimen,
so we could essentially put it back on the surface,
exactly where we found it.
And we can bring all this information into big GIS packages, today.
When we then find something very important,
like the bones of a human ancestor,
we begin to excavate it extremely carefully and slowly,
or the very first time that anybody has ever seen the remains.
And here's a very special moment, when my mother and myself
were digging up some remains of human ancestors.
And it is one of the most special things
to ever do with your mother.
(Laughter)
Not many people can say that.
I'd just like to point out, if you look at the map of Africa,
it does actually look like a hominid skull in its shape.
Now we're going to go to the East African and the Rift Valley.
It essentially runs up from the Gulf of Aden,
or runs down to Lake Malawi.
And the Rift Valley is a depression.
It's a basin, and rivers flow down from the highlands into the basin,
carrying sediment, preserving the bones of animals that lived there.
You then hope that the earth moves in such a way
as to bring the bones back up to the surface.
And then you hope that one of us lot
will walk around and find small pieces of you.
(Laughter)
OK, so it is absolutely surprising that we know as much
as we do know today about our ancestors,
because it's incredibly difficult,
A, for these things to become -- to be -- preserved,
and secondly, for them to have been brought back up to the surface.
and begin to actually piece together our evolutionary story.
in the very north of our country, Kenya.
And if you look north here, there's a big river that flows into the lake
that's been carrying sediment and preserving the remains
of the animals that lived there.
Fossil sites run up and down both lengths of that lake basin,
which represents some 20,000 square miles.
That's a huge job that we've got on our hands.
Two million years ago at Lake Turkana,
Homo erectus, one of our human ancestors,
in the north. But, essentially, two million years ago,
Homo erectus, up in the far right corner,
lived alongside three other species of human ancestor.
And here is a skull of a Homo erectus,
which I just pulled off the shelf there.
(Laughter)
In fact, if you go back in time,
Where did these things come from?
That's what we're still trying to find answers to,
and it is important to realize that there is diversity
in all different species, and our ancestors are no exception.
Here's some reconstructions of some of the fossils
that have been found from Lake Turkana.
essentially accompanying my parents to Lake Turkana
in search of human remains.
And we were able to dig up, when we got old enough,
fossils such as this, a slender-snouted crocodile.
a very exciting expedition was in place on the west side,
when they found essentially the skeleton of this Homo erectus.
because I was the same age that he was when he died.
And I imagined him to be tall, dark-skinned.
His brothers certainly were able to run long distances
chasing prey, probably sweating heavily as they did so.
And this individual himself, this one that I'm holding up here,
actually had a bad back. He'd probably had an injury as a child.
He had a scoliosis and therefore must have been looked after
members of his family group, to have got to where he did in life, age 12.
Unfortunately for him, he fell into a swamp
and couldn't get out.
Essentially, his bones were rapidly buried
and beautifully preserved.
when this very famous fossil hunter, Kamoya Kimeu,
walked along a small hillside
and found that small piece of his skull lying on the surface
It's actually this little piece up here on the top.
Well, an excavation was begun immediately,
and more and more little bits of skull
started to be extracted from the sediment.
And what was so fun about it was this:
the skull pieces got closer and closer to the roots of the tree,
and fairly recently the tree had grown up,
but it had found that the skull had captured nice water in the hillside,
and so it had decided to grow its roots in and around this,
holding it in place and preventing it from washing away down the slope.
We began to find limb bones; we found finger bones,
the bones of the pelvis, vertebrae, ribs, the collar bones,
things that had never, ever been seen before in Homo erectus.
It was truly exciting.
He had a body very similar to our own,
and he was on the threshold of becoming human.
started to move northwards out of Africa,
and you start to see fossils of Homo erectus
in Georgia, China and also in parts of Indonesia.
So, Homo erectus was the first human ancestor to leave Africa
and begin its spread across the globe.
Some exciting finds, again, as I mentioned,
from Dmanisi, in the Republic of Georgia.
But also, surprising finds
recently announced from the Island of Flores in Indonesia,
But they lived only 18,000 years ago,
and that is truly extraordinary to think about.
because people do find it hard to think of time,
Homo erectus left Africa 90,000 generations ago.
We evolved essentially from an African stock.
Again, at about 200,000 years as a fully-fledged us.
And we only left Africa about 70,000 years ago.
And until 30,000 years ago, at least three upright-walking apes
shared the planet Earth.
We're certainly a polluting, wasteful, aggressive species,
with a few nice things thrown in, perhaps.
(Laughter)
For the most part, we're not particularly pleasant at all.
We have a much larger brain than our ape ancestors.
Is this a good evolutionary adaptation, or is it going to lead us
to being the shortest-lived hominid species on planet Earth?
I think it's our collective intelligence.
It's our ability to write things down,
our language and our consciousness.
From very primitive beginnings, with a very crude tool kit of stones,
we now have a very advanced tool kit, and our tool use
has really reached unprecedented levels:
we've got buggies to Mars; we've mapped the human genome;
and recently even created synthetic life, thanks to Craig Venter.
all over the world, from extraordinary places.
Even from within an excavation in northern Kenya,
we can talk to people about what we're doing.
we have reached extraordinary numbers
of people on this planet.
Human ancestors really only survive on planet Earth,
if you look at the fossil record,
for about, on average, a million years at a time.
We've only been around for the past 200,000 years as a species,
yet we've reached a population of more than six and a half billion people.
I mean, these are extraordinary numbers.
has removed the checks and balances on our population growth.
We have to control our numbers, and I think this is as important
as anything else that's being done in the world today.
But we have to control our numbers,
because we can't really hold it together as a species.
It's important to remember that we all evolved in Africa.
We all have an African origin.
We have a common past and we share a common future.
Evolutionarily speaking, we're just a blip.
We're sitting on the edge of a precipice,
and we have the tools and the technology at our hands
to communicate what needs to be done
to hold it together today.
But will we do that, or will we just let nature take its course?
I think evolutionarily speaking,
this is probably a fairly good thing, in the end.
So I thought, "I will talk about death."
Seemed to be the passion today.
Actually, it's not about death.
It's inevitable, terrible, but really what I want to talk about is,
I'm just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die.
That's what I want to talk about.
that appeared soon after he died, saying,
"Hi! I'm Art Buchwald, and I just died."
And Mike, who I met at Galapagos, a trip which I won at TED,
is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling
his journey through cancer.
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting
through letters and a notebook.
In the last two years of his life, when he was sick,
he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me.
He wrote about my strengths, weaknesses,
and gentle suggestions for improvement,
quoting specific incidents, and held a mirror to my life.
Handwriting is a disappearing art.
I'm all for email and thinking while typing,
but why give up old habits for new?
Why can't we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives?
There are times when I want to trade all those years
that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him,
and trade all those years for one hug.
But too late.
But that's when I take out his letters and I read them,
and the paper that touched his hand is in mine,
and I feel connected to him.
with a value legacy, and not a financial one.
A value for things with a personal touch --
an autographed book, a soul-searching letter.
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience
could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper --
John, it'll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter
to someone they love, we actually may start a revolution
where our children may go to penmanship classes.
I collect autographed books, and those of you authors
in the audience know I hound you for them --
and CDs too, Tracy.
I plan to publish my own notebook.
As I witnessed my father's body being swallowed by fire,
I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote.
I have no idea how I'm going to do it,
but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine
into a book, and leave that published book for my son.
at my father's cremation.
And those linguists, please pardon the grammar,
because I've not looked at it in the last 10 years.
I took it out for the first time to come here.
"Picture in a frame, ashes in a bottle,
boundless energy confined in the bottle,
forcing me to deal with reality,
forcing me to deal with being grown up.
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong,
but right now, I am being sucked down, surrounded
and suffocated by these raging emotional waters,
craving to cleanse my soul, trying to emerge
on a firm footing one more time, to keep on fighting and flourishing
just as you taught me.
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair,
holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity,
to live again and to love again."
Thank you.
I got a visit almost exactly a year ago,
a little over a year ago, from a very senior person at the Department of Defense.
Came to see me and said, "1,600 of the kids that we've sent out
have come back missing at least one full arm.
Whole arm. Shoulder disarticulation.
And we're doing the same thing we did for -- more or less,
that we've done since the Civil War, a stick and a hook.
And they deserve more than that."
And literally, this guy sat in my office in New Hampshire and said,
"I want you to give me something that we can put on these kids
that'll pick up a raisin or a grape off a table,
they'll be able to put it in their mouth without destroying either one,
and they'll be able to know the difference without looking at it."
You know, had efferent, afferent, and haptic response.
and he said, "That's what I want from you."
I said, "Look, you're nuts. That technology's just not available right now.
And it can't be done.
Not in an envelope of a human arm,
with 21 degrees of freedom, from your shoulder to your fingertips."
He said, "About two dozen of these 1,600 kids have come back bilateral.
You think it's bad to lose one arm?
That's an inconvenience compared to having both of them gone."
I got a day job,
and my nights and weekends are already filled up with things like,
let's supply water to the world, and power to the world, and educate all the kids,
which, Chris, I will not talk about. I don't need another mission.
He says to me, "We've done some work around the country.
We've got some pretty amazing neurology and other people."
I said, "I'll take a field trip, I'll go see what you got."
Over the next month I visited lots of places, some out here, around the country,
found the best of the best.
I went down to Washington. I saw these guys, and said,
"I did what you asked me. I looked at what's out there.
I still think you're nuts. But not as nuts as I thought."
got up to 20 some-odd people.
We said, we're going to build a device that does what he wants.
We have 14 out of the 21 degrees of freedom;
you don't need the ones in the last two fingers.
We put this thing together.
A couple of weeks ago we took it down to Walter Reed,
which is unfortunately more in the news these days.
We showed it to a bunch of guys.
One guy who described himself as being lucky,
because he lost his left arm, and he's a righty.
He sat at a table with seven or eight of these other guys.
Said he was lucky, because he had his good arm,
and then he pushed himself back from the table. He had no legs.
These kids have attitudes that you just can't believe.
a 30-second piece, and then I'm done.
But understand what you're looking at
we made small enough to fit on a 50th percentile female,
so that we could put it in any of these people.
It's going to go inside something that we use in CAT scans and
MRIs of whatever is their good arm,
to make silicon rubber, then coat it, and paint it in 3D --
exact mirror image of their other limb.
So, you won't see all the really cool stuff that's in this series elastic set of 14 actuators,
each one which has its own capability to sense temperature and pressure.
It also has a pneumatic cuff that holds it on,
so the more they put themselves under load, the more it attaches.
They take the load off, and it becomes, again, compliant.
I'm going to show you a guy doing a couple of simple things with this
that we demonstrated in Washington. Can we look at this thing?
This weighs 6.9 pounds.
Going to scratch his nose.
It's got 14 active degrees of freedom.
Now he's going to pick up a pen with his opposed thumb and index finger.
Now he's going to put that down, pick up a piece of paper,
rotate all the degrees of freedom in his hand and wrist, and read it.
(Applause)
or many ideas you can't get rid of, anyway,
that are going extinct on the planet
And cockroaches, as anyone who's tried to get rid of them knows,
have become really immune to the poisons that we're using.
So bird counts are indicating
that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way.
So she adapted.
No one taught her to bend this into a hook
to drop lines through holes in the ice.
drop it among the traffic.
Wait for the light to stop the traffic.
What's significant about this isn't that crows are using cars
in a place called Sendai City, at a driving school
And since that time,
to new challenges and new resources in their environment,
I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine.
Basically, what happens is that we put this out in a field
or someplace where there's lots of crows.
and hop up and help themselves.
they keep coming back and digging out peanuts
from the pile of coins that's there.
When they get really happy about this, we stymie them.
and then they go off and play in traffic.
They know this machine has been messing with them
So they poke at it and peck at it.
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea:
isn't that we can train crows to pick up peanuts.
Mind you, there's 216 million dollars' worth of change lost every year,
I think crows can be trained to do other things.
For example, why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events?
So I really consider myself a storyteller.
in the sense that I don't usually tell my own stories.
Instead, I'm really interested in building tools that allow
large numbers of other people to tell their stories,
I do this because I think that people actually have a lot in common.
And we define ourselves by our gaps.
There's language gaps,
there's ethnicity and racial gaps, there's age gaps,
there's gender gaps, there's sexuality gaps,
there's wealth and money gaps, there's education gaps,
there's also religious gaps.
You know, we have all these gaps and I think we like our gaps
because they make us feel like we identify with something,
some smaller community.
is that there's traditionally been this imbalance
between the desire that we have to express ourselves
and the number of sympathetic friends
who are willing to stand around and listen.
Since the dawn of human history, we've tried to rectify this imbalance
by making art, writing poems, singing songs,
scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper,
gossiping with friends. This is nothing new.
a lot of these very traditional physical human activities,
And as that's happened, people have been leaving behind footprints,
And so what I do is, I write computer programs
that study very large sets of these footprints,
which was made about a year ago,
scans the world's newly-posted blog entries
for occurrences of the phrases "I feel" or "I am feeling."
And when it finds one of those phrases,
it grabs the sentence up to the period,
and then automatically tries to deduce the age, gender
and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence.
Then, knowing the geographical location and the time,
we can also then figure out the weather
when that person wrote the sentence.
that collects about 20,000 feelings a day.
It's been running for about a year and a half.
It's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now.
And I'll show you a glimpse
of how this information is then visualized. So this is We Feel Fine.
each of which represents a single human feeling
The color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside --
And sad, negative feelings are darkly colored.
The diameter of each dot
represents the length of the sentence inside,
and the small dots contain small sentences.
Any dot can be clicked and expanded. And we see here,
So it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes
in the world of human emotions.
And all of these are stated by people:
"I know that objectively it really doesn't mean much,
but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond,
it's nice to feel bigger again."
and they swarm wildly around, kind of exploring the world of life.
And then they also exhibit curiosity.
You can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now.
around six words. Those six words represent the six movements
of We Feel Fine. We're currently seeing Madness.
There's also Murmurs, Montage, Mobs, Metrics and Mounds.
And I'll walk you through a few of those now.
Murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling.
And then, one by one, in reverse chronological order,
they excuse themselves, entering the scrolling list of feelings.
"I feel a bit better now."
"I feel like I'm in this fog of depression that I can't get out of."
And you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog
from which it was collected. And in that way,
you can connect with the authors of these statements
Montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs
to become extracted and display themselves in a grid.
This grid is then said to represent the picture of the world's feelings
in the last few hours, if you will.
Each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up.
We see, "I just feel like I'm not going to have fun
if it's not the both of us." That was from someone in Michigan.
We see, "I feel like I have been at a computer all day."
"I think I feel a little full."
Mobs provides different statistical breakdowns
of the population of the world's feelings in the last few hours.
We can also get a gender breakdown.
We see people in their twenties are the most prolific,
In weather, the feelings assume the physical characteristics
of the weather that they represent,
so that the ones collected on a sunny day
Metrics provides more numerical views on the data.
Here are gender, age, weather, location.
which kind of jiggle.
We see "better" is the most frequent feeling, followed by "bad."
And then if I go over here, the list begins to scroll,
and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected.
Here we see people that feel "slipping," "nauseous," "responsible."
So here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected:
"I feel very lonely."
"I feel in love with Carolyn." "I feel so naughty."
"I feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life."
as they live their lives. It scans the world's blogs
and looks at what people are writing,
and these people don't know they're being watched or interviewed.
And because of that,
you end up getting very honest, candid, sincere responses
And this is a technique that I explored in a different project,
It was divided into ten very simple themes --
love, anger, sadness and so on --
each of which contained a single, very open-ended question
put to the world: What do you love? What makes you angry?
It's a spinning globe,
the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures
and words and drawings of people
that submitted to the time capsule.
The ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule.
You can sift through this data and see what people have submitted.
So this project was punctuated by a really amazing event,
which was held in the desert outside Albuquerque in New Mexico
at the Jemez Pueblo, where for three consecutive nights,
the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides
of the ancient Red Rock Canyon walls,
which stand about 200 feet tall. It was really incredible.
And we also projected the contents of the time capsule
as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space.
You can see the orange line leaving the desert floor
at about a 45 degree angle there. This was amazing
because the first night I looked at all this information
and really started seeing the gaps that I talked about earlier --
the differences in age, gender and wealth and so on.
and saw these images go across the rocks,
the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture.
And it was really moving. And this picture here was taken
the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away,
where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space.
And there was something very moving
about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky.
and how humans have always used the night sky
to project their great stories.
You know, as a child in Vermont, on a farm where I grew up,
I would often look up into the dark sky
And as an adult, I've been more aware
You know, Orion facing the roaring bull.
Perseus flying to the rescue of Andromeda.
Zeus battling Chronos for control of Mount Olympus.
I mean, these are the great tales of the Greeks.
And it caused me to wonder specifically,
what would those look like? What would those be?
If we could make new pictures in the sky, what would we draw?
which is debuting here today at TED.
Nobody's seen this yet, publicly.
It's called Universe: Revealing Our Modern Mythology.
And it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky.
So, it's my great pleasure now to show this to you.
and there's an Aurora Borealis in the background,
kind of morphing with color. The color of the Aurora Borealis
can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom,
and we'll put it down here to red.
Each of those stars actually represents
a news story, a person, a company. You know,
And you might notice that as the cursor begins
to touch some of these stars, that shapes begin to emerge.
And those are
the constellations of today.
It's using the API of a really great company that I work with
And it's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level
of the world's current mythology over the last couple of months.
Iraq, Bush. And we can actually isolate just the words --
playing a big role recently.
And the things that relate to Ford enter its orbit
We can click on one of those
and have the photograph be the center of the universe.
Now the things that relate to it are swirling around.
We can click on this and we see this iconic image
of Betty Ford kissing her husband's coffin.
This is a photographic representation, called Snapshots.
But we can actually be more specific in defining our universe.
So, if we want to,
let's check out what Bill Clinton's universe looks like.
And let's see, in the past week, what he's been up to.
So now, we have a new universe, which is just constrained
We can see the stories
that Bill Clinton is taking part in right now.
Any of those can be opened up.
we get different perspectives on this story.
You can click any of those to go out and read the article
at the source. This one's from Al Jazeera.
that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines
in the universe of Bill Clinton. So there's Bill Clinton, Hillary,
Iraq, George Bush, Barack Obama, Scooter Libby --
these are kind of the people of Bill Clinton.
We can also see a world map, so this shows us the geographic reach
we'll see what that universe looks like.
Here we have our star field. Here we have our shapes.
Here we have our secrets.
So we see again, climate change is large:
Nairobi, global conference, environmental.
And there are also quotes that you can see,
these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept.
So this is a piece that demands exploration.
And you'll all be able to use it and kind of explore
what your own personal mythology might be.
and then see what the constellations of those might look like.
First of all, I've been watching this trend
where we have these books like such and such "For Dummies."
Do you know these books, these such and such "For Dummies?"
My daughters pointed out that I'm very similar looking, so this is a bit of a problem.
(Laughter)
But I was looking online at Amazon.com for other books like this.
You know, there's also something called the "Complete Idiot's Guide?"
There's a sort of business model around being stupid in some sense.
We like to have technology make us feel bad, for some strange reason.
I was in Milan last week, for the Italian launch.
It's kind of a book about questions, questions about simplicity.
Very few answers. I'm also wondering myself, what is simplicity?
Is it good? Is it bad? Is complexity better? I'm not sure.
I was very tired of simplicity, as you can imagine.
And so in my life, I've discovered that
vacation is the most important skill for any kind of over-achiever.
Because your companies will always take away your life,
but they can never take away your vacation -- in theory.
(Laughter)
and I went to the Gap, because I only have black pants.
So I went and bought khaki shorts or whatever,
and unfortunately, their branding was all about "Keep It Simple."
(Laughter)
I opened up a magazine, and Visa's branding was,
"Business Takes Simplicity."
I develop photographs, and Kodak said, "Keep It Simple."
So, I felt kind of weird that simplicity was sort of following me around.
but you know this person? This is Paris Hilton, apparently.
And she has this show, "The Simple Life."
So I watched this. It's not very simple, a little bit confusing.
(Laughter)
So, I looked for a different show to watch.
So, I opened up this TV Guide thing,
and on the E! channel, this "Simple Life" show is very popular.
They'll play it over, and over, and over.
(Laughter)
So it was traumatizing, actually.
And Cape Cod, there are idyllic roads, and all of us can drive in this room.
And when you drive, these signs are very important.
It's a very simple sign, it says, "road" and "road approaching."
So I'm mostly driving along, okay, and then I saw this sign.
(Laughter)
So, I thought complexity was attacking me suddenly,
so I thought, "Ah, simplicity. Very important."
What if the sky was 41 percent gray? Wouldn't that be the perfect sky?"
I mean that simplicity sky.
But in reality, the sky looked like this. It was a beautiful, complex sky.
We're human beings: we love complex things.
We love relationships -- very complex. So we love this kind of stuff.
Maybe some of you guys have heard of this place.
It's designed by I. M. Pei, one of the premier modernist architects.
Modernism means white box, and it's a perfect white box.
(Laughter)
And some of you guys are entrepreneurs, etc., whatever.
Last month, I was at Google, and, boy, that cafeteria, man.
You guys have things here in Silicon Valley like stock options.
See, in academia, we get titles, lots of titles.
I have a default title as a father of a bunch of daughters.
This year at TED, I'm happy to report that I have new titles,
in addition to my previous titles.
Another "Associate Director of Research."
And this also happened, so I have five daughters now.
(Laughter)
That's my baby Reina. (Applause) Thank you.
And so, my life is much more complex because of the baby, actually,
but that's okay. We will still stay married, I think.
you see, I grew up in a tofu factory in Seattle.
Many of you may not like tofu because you haven't had good tofu,
but tofu's a good food. It's a very simple kind of food.
It's very hard work to make tofu.
As a child, we used to wake up at 1 a.m. and work till 6 p.m., six days a week.
My father was kind of like Andy Grove, paranoid of the competition.
So often, seven days a week. Family business equals child labor.
School was great, and maybe going to school
helped me get to this Media Lab place, I'm not sure.
(Laughter)
Thank you.
But the Media Lab is an interesting place, and it's important to me
because as a student, I was a computer science undergrad,
and I discovered design later on in my life.
Who knows Muriel Cooper? Muriel Cooper?
Wasn't she amazing? Muriel Cooper. She was wacky.
And she was a TEDster, exactly, and she showed us,
she showed the world how to make the computer beautiful again.
And she's very important in my life,
because she's the one that told me to leave MIT and go to art school.
It was the best advice I ever got. So I went to art school, because of her.
She passed away in 1994,
and I was hired back to MIT to try to fill her shoes, but it's so hard.
This amazing person, Muriel Cooper.
I had a nice sort of situation, because somehow I was connected to Paul Rand.
Some of you guys know Paul Rand,
the greatest graphic designer -- I'm sorry -- out there.
The great graphic designer Paul Rand
designed the IBM logo, the Westinghouse logo.
He basically said, "I've designed everything."
And also Ikko Tanaka was a very important mentor in my life --
the Paul Rand of Japan. He designed most of the major icons of Japan,
like Issey Miyake's brand and also Muji.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar talked about mentors,
these people in your life -- the problem with mentors is that they all die.
This is a sad thing, but it's actually a happy thing in a way,
because you can remember them in their pure form.
I think that the mentors that we all meet sort of humanize us.
When you get older, and you're all freaked out, whatever,
the mentors calm us down.
And I'm grateful for my mentors, and I'm sure all of you are too.
The T doesn't stand for "human," it stands for "technology."
And because of that, I always wondered about this human thing.
So, I've always been Googling this word, "human,"
to find out how many hits I get.
And in 2001, I had 26 million hits, and for "computer,"
because computers are against humans a bit,
So, if you sort of compare that, like this,
you'll see that computer versus human --
I've been tracking this for the last year --
computer versus human over the last year has changed.
It used to be kind of two to one. Now, humans are catching up.
Very good, us humans! We're catching up with the computers.
In the simplicity realm, it's also interesting.
So if you compare complexities to simplicity,
it's also catching up in a way, too.
So, somehow humans and simplicity are intertwined, I think.
I spent my entire early career making complex stuff.
Lots of complex stuff.
I wrote computer programs to make complex graphics like this.
I had clients in Japan to make really complex stuff like this.
And I've always felt bad about it, in a sense.
So, I hid in a time dimension.
I built things in a time-graphics dimension.
I did this series of calendars for Shiseido.
This is a floral theme calendar in 1997,
and this is a firework calendar. So, you launch the number into space,
because the Japanese believe that when you see fireworks,
you're cooler for some reason.
This is why they have fireworks in the summer.
A very extreme culture.
Lastly, this is a fall-based calendar,
because I have so many leaves in my yard.
So this is the leaves in my yard, essentially.
I've been lucky to have been there before people made these kind of things,
and so I made all this kind of stuff that messes with your eyes.
I feel kind of bad about that.
Tomorrow, Paola Antonelli is speaking. I love Paola.
She has this show right now at MoMA,
where some of these early works are here on display at MoMA, on the walls.
If you're in New York, please go and see that.
and people say, "Oh, I know your work.
You're the guy that makes eye candy."
And when you're told this, you feel kind of weird.
"Eye candy" -- sort of pejorative, don't you think?
So, I say, "No, I make eye meat," instead.
(Laughter)
And eye meat is something different, something more fibrous,
something more powerful, perhaps. But what could that be, eye meat?
Computer programs are essentially trees,
and when you make art with a computer program, there's kind of a problem.
Whenever you make art with a computer program,
you're always on the tree, and the paradox is that
for excellent art, you want to be off the tree.
So, this is sort of a complication I've found.
I took these to Tokyo in 2001 to make computer objects.
This is a new way to type, on my old, color Classic.
You can't type very much on this.
I also discovered that an IR mouse responds to CRT emissions
and starts to move by itself, so this is a self-drawing machine.
And also, one year, the G3 Bondi Blue thing --
that caddy would come out, like, dangerous, like, "whack," like that.
But I thought, "This is very interesting. What if I make like a car crash test?"
So I have a crash test.
(Laughter)
And sort of measure the impact. Stuff like this are things I made,
just to sort of understand what these things are.
(Laughter)
I was concerned with contemporary art
that was all about piss, and sort of really sad things,
and so I wanted to think about something happy.
So I focused on food as my area --
these sort of clementine peel things.
In Japan, it's a wonderful thing to remove the clementine peel
just in one piece. Who's done that before? One-piece clementine?
Oh, you guys are missing out, if you haven't done it yet.
It was very good, and I discovered I can make sculptures out of this,
actually, in different forms.
If you dry them quick, you can make, like, elephants and steers and stuff,
and my wife didn't like these, because they mold, so I had to stop that.
and scanned them all. And I was looking for some kind of food theme,
and I wrote some software to automatically lay out french-fry images.
And as a child, I'd hear that song, you know,
"Oh, beautiful, for spacious skies, for amber waves of grain,"
so I made this amber waves image.
It's sort of a Midwest cornfield out of french fries.
so I used to love Cheetos. Oh, I love Cheetos, yummy.
So, I wanted to play with Cheetos in some way.
I wasn't sure where to go with this. I invented Cheeto paint.
Cheeto paint is a very simple way to paint with Cheetos.
(Laughter)
I discovered that Cheetos are good, expressive material.
And with these Cheetos, I began to think,
"What can I make with these Cheetos?"
I was looking for some kind of form,
and in the end, I made 100 butter-fries. Do you get it?
(Laughter)
And each butter-fry is composed of different pieces.
People ask me how they make the antenna.
Sometimes, they find a hair in the food. That's my hair.
My hair's clean -- it's okay.
It's a strange business model. I can come into work everyday
and staple five pieces of paper and just stare at it with my latte.
End of story.
(Laughter)
But I realized that life could be very boring,
so I've been thinking about life, and I notice that my camera --
my digital camera versus my car, a very strange thing.
The car is so big, the camera is so small,
yet the manual for the camera is so much bigger than the car manual.
It doesn't make any sense.
(Laughter)
and I discovered, in this weird, M. Night Shyamalan way,
that I discovered [the] letters, M, I, T. You know the word?
In the words "simplicity" and "complexity," M, I, T occur in perfect sequence.
It's a bit eerie, isn't it?
So, I thought, maybe I'll do this for the next twenty years or something.
It's a very short, simple book. There are ten laws and three keys.
The ten laws and three keys -- I won't go over them because that's why I have a book,
and also that's why it's on the Web for free.
But the laws are kind of like sushi in a way: there are all kinds.
In Japan, they say that sushi is challenging.
You know the uni is the most challenging, so number ten is challenging.
People hate number ten like they hate uni, actually.
The three keys are easy to eat, so this is anago, cooked already, so easy to eat.
So enjoy your sushi meal later, with the laws of simplicity.
Because I want to simplify them for you.
Because that's what this is about. I have to simplify this thing.
I have what's called the cookie versus laundry thing.
Anyone who has kids knows that if you offer a kid
a big cookie or a small cookie,
which cookie are they going to take? The big cookie.
You can say the small cookie has Godiva chocolate bits in it,
but it doesn't work. They want the big cookie.
But if you offer kids two piles of laundry to fold,
the small pile or the big pile, which will they choose?
You know, when you want more, it's because you want to enjoy it.
When you want less, it's because it's about work.
And so, to boil it all down, simplicity is about living life
with more enjoyment and less pain.
I think this is sort of simple more versus less.
Basically, it always depends.
This book I wrote because I want to figure out life.
I love life. I love being alive. I like to see things.
And so life is a big question, I think, in simplicity,
because you're trying to simplify your life.
By being at TED, we see so many things at one time.
And I can't help but enjoy looking at everything in the world.
Like everything you see, every time you wake up.
It's such a joy to sort of experience everything in the world.
From everything from a weird hotel lobby,
to Saran wrap placed over your window,
to this moment where I had my road in front of my house paved dark black,
and this white moth was sitting there dying in the sun.
because life is finite.
This was given to me by the chairman of Shiseido.
He's an expert in aging. This horizontal axis is how old you are --
twelve years old, twenty-four years old, seventy-four, ninety-six years old --
and this is some medical data. So, brain strength increases up to 60,
and then after 60, it sort of goes down. Kind of depressing in a way.
You know, I have a lot of cocky freshmen at MIT, so I tell them,
"Oh, your bodies are really getting stronger and stronger,
but in your late twenties and mid-thirties, cells, they die."
OK. It gets them to work harder, sometimes.
And if you have your vision, vision is interesting.
As you age from infant age, your vision gets better,
and maybe in your late teens, early twenties, you're looking for a mate,
and your vision goes after that.
(Laughter)
So, as you get older, you may, like, have kids, whatever.
And then the kids graduate, and you have no responsibility any more --
that's very good, too.
"What actually goes up? Does anything go up?
What's the positive part of this, you know?" I think wisdom always goes up.
I love these eighty-year-old, ninety-year-old guys and women.
They have so many thoughts, and they have so much wisdom,
and I think -- you know, this TED thing, I've come here.
And this is the fourth time, and I come here for this wisdom, I think.
This whole TED effect, it sort of ups your wisdom, somehow.
And I'm so glad to be here, and I'm very grateful to be here, Chris.
And this is an amazing experience for me as well.
You all know this story.
In the summer of 1950,
Enrico Fermi, the Italian-American physicist
and atomic-pile builder,
went to lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory
and joined some colleagues there, and asked them a question:
"Where is everybody?"
This confused his colleagues, obviously,
because they were sitting right there with him.
And then he had to clarify that he wasn't talking about them.
He was talking about the space aliens.
the supposed flying saucer crash
at Roswell, New Mexico.
And even though that turned out to be nothing,
nothing at all --
(Laughter) --
merely a downed weather balloon
piloted by small hairless men
with slits for mouths ...
Still, America had gone saucer-mad,
even famous scientists
who were eating lunch.
Fermi's reasoning, if I may paraphrase badly,
is that the universe is so vast
that it stands to reason,
there should be other intelligent life out there.
And the universe is so old
that unless we were the very first civilization ever to evolve,
we should have some evidence of their existence by now.
And yet, to the best of our knowledge, we are alone.
and his colleagues had no answer.
Fermi then went on with the same blunt logic
to disprove fairies,
Sasquatch, God,
the possibility of love --
and thereafter, as you know,
Enrico Fermi ate alone.
(Laughter)
Now,
I am not a scientist.
I have never built an atomic pile.
Although, I might argue that, technically,
every pile is atomic.
that Enrico Fermi perhaps did not consider.
One is that the aliens might be
very far away.
Perhaps, I dare say,
even on other planets.
The other possibility --
(Laughter) --
is, perhaps, Enrico Fermi himself
was an alien.
Isn't it a little convenient
that in the midst of the World War, out of nowhere,
suddenly an Italian scientist showed up
with an amazing new technology
that would transform everything in the world
and darken the history of the human species forever after?
And isn't it a little strange
that he required no payment for this?
That he asked for only one thing --
a gift of two healthy sperm whales?
That's -- that's not true.
But it is strange.
wouldn't he be the first to have tried to convince
his fellow scientists
that the space aliens are not already here?
For it is given in certain UFO-ology
or UFOlogy circles,
that the aliens are already here and have been for millennia;
that they have walked among us in disguise,
observing us, guiding our evolution
from ape to man --
if you believe in that sort of thing --
and, occasionally, kidnapping us in their flying saucers
and taking us away to have sex with us in pyramids.
I think you'll agree.
there are memories I have
that are difficult to explain --
happenings that are so odd and unaccountably weird,
that it is difficult to imagine
they were not the result
of prolonged and frequent contact with aliens throughout my life.
For how else will you explain
the amazing and absolutely true
close encounters that I had
and will describe to you now?
Encounter one: Ocean City, New Jersey, 1980.
This was the summer when the special edition of
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind" was released.
And I went on vacation with my parents to the Jersey shore.
Within 12 hours, I was horribly sunburned,
just like Richard Dreyfuss in the movie.
largely sitting outside our little rental house at night,
the sidewalk still warm from the sun,
watching the skies for UFOs.
What did I see? Stars, satellites,
blinking airplanes -- typical sky junk.
Occasionally, kids would come and
join me and watch,
but their necks soon got sore, and they would go off to the boardwalk
to play video games and mingle with humans.
I was pretty good at the video games. I was not very good at the other part,
so I stayed alone with the cosmos.
An elderly couple came walking down the street.
I would say they were in their late seventies,
and I would say that they were on a date,
because he was wearing a very neat little suit
with a yellow tie -- a brown suit.
And she was wearing a cardigan, because it was now fully night
and a chill was coming in off the ocean.
I remember, for some reason,
that they were exactly the same height.
And then they stopped, and the man turned to me
and said,
"What are you looking for,
flying saucers?"
for an old man on a date.
But what was stranger still --
and even I realized it at the time,
as a nine-year-old child --
was that they stopped at all.
That this old man would interrupt his moonlight stroll
with his sweetheart with the precise reason
of making fun of a child.
"Oh," he said,
"little green men."
And then his girlfriend joined in, too.
"There's no such thing as space men," she said.
"There's no such thing."
And then they both laughed. "Ha, ha, ha."
I looked around.
The street was entirely empty.
I had stopped hearing the sound of the ocean.
It was as though time had stopped.
I did not know why they were teasing me.
I looked into their strangely angry faces,
and I remember wondering,
are they wearing rubber masks?
Giant, almond-shaped, unblinking eyes?
Slits for mouths?
The old man crooked his finger as though he were firing a gun,
and then he made laser sounds.
"Kew, kew, kew --
watch out."
And they turned at once and walked away.
The old man reached out
his knobbly claw
for the woman's hand,
and found it, and left me alone.
Now, you could describe this as a simple misunderstanding --
a strange encounter among humans.
Maybe it was swamp gas, but --
(Laughter) --
I know what I saw.
I went to see the movie "Dune,"
and a girl talked to me. Now, on its face --
(Laughter) --
this is impossible on its face, I realize --
but it is absolutely true.
It was opening night, naturally.
I went with my friend Tim McGonigal, who sat on my left.
On my right was the girl in question.
She had long, curly black hair, a blue jean jacket.
I remember, she had some sort of injury to her ankle,
an Ace bandage, and she had crutches.
She was very tall, I would say.
I was starting high school at the time. I would say she was a junior,
but I had never seen her before. She didn't go to my school.
I didn't know her name, and I never will.
She was sitting with someone who I presume was her mother,
and they were talking about the novel, "Dune."
They were both big fans, mother and daughter --
very unusual.
They were talking about how their favorite characters
were the giant sandworms.
And then it got stranger.
That's when she turned to me and said,
"Are you looking forward to seeing the movie?"
because I had not read the novel "Dune" at that time.
I was merely a connoisseur of movies
featuring desert planets, as I still am.
But it was also the tone of how she asked the question:
apropos of nothing, like she didn't even care about the answer,
as though she just wanted to talk to me.
I did not know what to say. I said, "Yes."
I did not even turn my head.
The movie began.
I need not remind you that this was David Lynch's version of "Dune,"
in which all of the characters
were sexy and deformed at the same time.
which was a kind of giant, floating fetus-creature
that lived in a giant tank with this orange mist
of psychedelic spice
swirling around him,
allowing him to bend space and time.
He could never leave the tank
or interact with the outside world.
He had become, in his isolation,
so deformed and so sexy,
that he had to talk through a kind of old-timey radio
to the outside world, and could never touch them.
I mean, I liked him a lot better than the sandworms.
The sandworms were fine, but your favorite character?
Please.
everyone seemed very happy
to get up and get out of the theatre as soon as possible.
Except for the girl.
As I walked out, her pace slowed.
Perhaps it was the crutches,
but it seemed --
(Laughter) --
it seemed as though she might want to talk to me again.
When I say it out loud, it sounds so ridiculous,
but I can only come to the conclusion
that it was what, in the alien abductee community,
they call a "screen memory":
a ridiculous false recollection designed by their brain
to cover up some trauma -- say, of being kidnapped
and flown off to a sex pyramid.
I did not slow down to talk to her.
I sure am glad I never saw her again.
1989.
In the mid-to-late '80s,
the novelist Whitley Strieber wrote a book called "Communion,"
in which he described his own lifelong experiences
being abducted by aliens.
And he also described the phenomenon known in this community
as "lost time,"
where Whitley Strieber would suddenly become aware
that he could not remember the previous ten minutes,
or the previous ten hours, or the previous ten days.
And would come to the conclusion that that was when the aliens
were taking him and giving him rectal probes.
This image by Ted Joseph was from that book,
and was his, sort of, police sketch
of what the creatures looked like
that Whitley Strieber had described to him.
And it was so successful that they made it into a movie.
And in 1989, the way I remember it,
I was in Philadelphia
visiting my girlfriend, and we decided,
apropos of nothing, to go see this movie.
And the way I remember it, the movie featured these details.
One: Whitley Strieber
was played by Christopher Walken.
Two: the alien was played by a rubber puppet.
sequence of the film in which the rubber puppet
gives Christopher Walken a rectal probe.
Four: this was being shown
in a regular movie theater in Center City, Philadelphia.
Five: all of which is to say,
they made a movie out of the book, "Communion,"
and it starred Christopher Walken.
Does something seem strange about this to you?
Something odd? Something off? Something wrong with this picture?
Think about it. Yes. The answer is:
I had a girlfriend. What?
I remember walking out of the theater
and becoming suddenly aware of this fact,
as we walked hand in hand,
and pondering these very same questions.
And to this day, I have no answer for you.
Close encounter four: the Algarve,
Portugal, 1991.
Some years later, I and this woman --
we'll call her "Catherine Fletcher" --
(Laughter) --
went traveling through the south of Portugal together.
We stayed in old, crumbling, walled cities,
in tiny little hotels,
and we would climb up to the roof and drink Vinho Verde
and watch the sun set and play checkers.
What? Did we do this? Really? Does anyone do this?
We went to some topless beaches.
Excuse me? No, not in my life.
For what it's worth, we went to Sagres,
which was considered, at the time, to be the end of the world.
And there I was chased by a pack of feral dogs on the dock,
and the lead dog bit me on the ass,
requiring me to go to a strange Portuguese clinic
and receive an ass shot.
Make of that what you will.
we were in the district capital of Faro,
and Catherine decided that she wanted to go to the beach
one last time.
Now, Faro is a bustling little city,
and to get to the beach, she explained, you would have to take
a bus and then a boat.
And did I want to come with?
But I was exhausted and dog-bitten, and so I said, "No."
I remember what she looked like before she left.
The freckles had grown
and multiplied on her face and shoulders,
clustering into a kind of a tan.
A tan, we were both tan --
is this true?
Her eyes were extra bright and extra blue, as a result.
She was smiling.
She was a single woman about to go alone into a country,
not even speaking the language,
to travel alone by bus and boat
to go to a beach she did not know
or had never seen.
I loved her, and then she went out
into that strange, alien land.
it was very late in the day, almost dinnertime,
and she had not come back.
Nervous, I went down to the street to look for her.
Now, I did not speak Portuguese.
I did not know where the beach was.
I could not call her on a cell phone because this was 1991,
and the aliens had not given us that technology yet.
two possible outcomes:
either Catherine would come back to the hotel,
or she would never come back to the hotel.
And so I sat down to wait.
I did not watch the skies, but the very end of the street
where the buses and cars and pedestrians
and little scooters were moving along.
And I watched those constellations shift,
hoping that they would part and I would see her face.
It was at that moment,
in that very small town of 30,000 or so,
that I truly appreciated the vastness of the universe
and the searching we might do in it.
And that's when the Liberians came along.
Five young men -- all laughing, happy, traveling together,
coming back to this hotel where they were staying.
what was I doing, and I explained.
And he said, "Don't worry." He was sure that Catherine would be safe.
But he did not seem so very sure,
for he sat down to wait with me.
And for the next two hours, they all waited with me:
taking turns, going up to their room, coming back,
telling me jokes, distracting me.
Two hours, they gave me a message.
We are not alone.
I turned and looked down the street.
The stars aligned, and she came back.
She was smiling. She did not understand why I was so worried.
Neither did the Liberians,
although there was a huge amount of relief in their laughter
as they clapped us on the back, and went back up to their room
and left us alone in the street, holding hands.
An event like this leaves a scar on the memory,
much like a piece of alien technology
that has been inserted into your buttocks
by a "Portuguese doctor."
even now that we are married,
I look for her still, whenever she is not in the room.
And even though, I think you'll agree, it is probable
that during the time she was away,
she was kidnapped and replaced by an alien clone,
I love her and wait for her still.
I've actually been waiting by the phone
for a call from TED for years.
And in fact, in 2000, I was ready to talk about eBay, but no call.
In 2003, I was ready to do a talk
about the Skoll Foundation and social entrepreneurship. No call.
In 2004, I started Participant Productions
and we had a really good first year, and no call.
And finally, I get a call last year,
and then I have to go up after J.J. Abrams.
(Laughter)
You've got a cruel sense of humor, TED.
(Laughter)
I had some misgivings.
But I found that there were some advantages to being in Hollywood.
(Laughter)
And, in fact, some advantages to owning your own media company.
And I also found that Hollywood and Silicon Valley
have a lot more in common than I would have dreamed.
Hollywood has its sex symbols, and the Valley has its sex symbols.
(Laughter)
Hollywood has its rivalries, and the Valley has its rivalries.
Hollywood gathers around power tables,
and the Valley gathers around power tables.
So it turned out there was a lot more in common
than I would have dreamed.
And part of it is a personal story. When Chris invited me to speak,
he said, people think of you as a bit of an enigma,
and they want to know what drives you a bit.
And what really drives me is a vision of the future
that I think we all share.
It's a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability.
And when we heard a lot of the presentations
over the last couple of days,
Ed Wilson and the pictures of James Nachtwey,
I think we all realized how far we have to go
to get to this new version of humanity
that I like to call "Humanity 2.0."
And it's also something that resides in each of us,
to close what I think
are the two big calamities in the world today.
this gap that President Clinton last night
called uneven, unfair and unsustainable --
and, out of that, comes poverty and illiteracy and disease
and all these evils that we see around us.
But perhaps the other, bigger gap is what we call the hope gap.
And someone, at some point, came up with this very bad idea
that an ordinary individual couldn't make a difference in the world.
And I think that's just a horrible thing.
And so chapter one really begins today, with all of us,
because within each of us is the power to
equal those opportunity gaps and to close the hope gaps.
And if the men and women of TED
can't make a difference in the world, I don't know who can.
and my family used to go camping in upstate New York.
And there really wasn't much to do there for the summer,
except get beaten up by my sister or read books.
And so I used to read authors like James Michener
and James Clavell and Ayn Rand.
And their stories made the world seem a very small
and interconnected place.
And it struck me that if I could write stories
that were about this world as being small and interconnected,
that maybe I could get people interested in the issues
that affected us all, and maybe engage them to make a difference.
so I decided to go on a path to become financially independent,
so I could write these stories as quickly as I could.
I then had a bit of a wake-up call when I was 14.
And my dad came home one day
and announced that he had cancer, and it looked pretty bad.
And what he said was, he wasn't so much afraid that he might die,
but that he hadn't done the things that he wanted to with his life.
And knock on wood, he's still alive today, many years later.
But for a young man that made a real impression on me,
that one never knows how much time one really has.
So I set out in a hurry. I studied engineering.
I started a couple of businesses
that I thought would be the ticket to financial freedom.
called Micros on the Move,
which is very well named,
because people kept stealing the computers.
(Laughter)
So I figured I needed to learn a little bit more about business,
so I went to Stanford Business School and studied there.
And while I was there, I made friends with a fellow
named Pierre Omidyar, who is here today. And Pierre, I apologize
for this. This is a photo from the old days.
And just after I'd graduated, Pierre came to me
with this idea to help people
buy and sell things online with each other.
And with the wisdom of my Stanford degree,
I said, "Pierre, what a stupid idea."
(Laughter)
And needless to say, I was right.
(Laughter)
to build eBay as a company. And the rest of that story, you know.
The company went public two years later
and is today one of the best known companies in the world.
Hundreds of millions of people use it in hundreds of countries, and so on.
But for me, personally, it was a real change.
I went from living in a house with five guys in Palo Alto
and living off their leftovers,
to all of a sudden having all kinds of resources.
And I wanted to figure out how I could
take the blessing of these resources and share it with the world.
who is a remarkable man.
He was the architect of the Great Society programs
under Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s.
And I asked him what he felt was the best thing I could do,
or anyone could do, to make a difference
in the long-term issues facing humanity.
And John said, "Bet on good people doing good things.
Bet on good people doing good things."
And that really resonated with me.
to bet on these good people doing good things.
These leading, innovative, nonprofit folks,
who are using business skills in a very leveraged way
to solve social problems.
People today we call social entrepreneurs.
And to put a face on it, people like Muhammad Yunus,
who started the Grameen Bank,
has lifted 100 million people plus out of poverty around the world,
won the Nobel Peace Prize.
But there's also a lot of people that you don't know.
Folks like Ann Cotton, who started a group called CAMFED in Africa,
because she felt girls' education was lagging.
And she started it about 10 years ago,
and today, she educates over a quarter million African girls.
And somebody like Dr. Victoria Hale,
who started the world's first nonprofit pharmaceutical company,
and whose first drug will be fighting visceral leishmaniasis,
also known as black fever.
And by 2010, she hopes to eliminate this disease,
which is really a scourge in the developing world.
And so this is one way to bet
on good people doing good things.
that I find really is powerful.
It's what we call, "Invest, connect and celebrate."
And invest: if you see good people doing good things,
invest in them. Invest in their organizations,
or in business. Invest in these folks.
Connecting them together through conferences --
like a TED -- brings so many powerful connections,
or through the World Forum on Social Entrepreneurship
that my foundation does at Oxford every year.
And celebrate them: tell their stories,
because not only are there good people doing good work,
but their stories can help close these gaps of hope.
that really got me back to thinking when I was a kid
and wanted to tell stories to get people involved
in the issues that affect us all.
And a light bulb went off,
which was, first, that I didn't actually have to do the writing myself, I could find writers.
And then the next light bulb was, better than just writing,
what about film and TV, to get out to people in a big way?
And I thought about the films that inspired me,
films like "Gandhi" and "Schindler's List."
And I wondered who was doing these kinds of films today.
And there really wasn't a specific company
that was focused on the public interest.
to talk about the idea of a pro-social media company
and I was met with a lot of encouragement.
One of the lines of encouragement
that I heard over and over was,
"The streets of Hollywood are littered with the carcasses of people like you,
who think you're going to come to this town and make movies."
And then of course, there was the other adage.
"The surest way to become a millionaire
is to start by being a billionaire and go into the movie business."
(Laughter)
with the vision to be a global media company
focused on the public interest.
And our mission is to produce entertainment
that creates and inspires social change.
And we don't just want people to see our movies
and say, that was fun, and forget about it.
We want them to actually get involved in the issues.
In 2005, we launched our first slate of films,
"Murder Ball," "North Country," "Syriana"
and "Good Night and Good Luck."
And much to my surprise, they were noticed.
And it turned out to be a pretty good year for this guy.
Perhaps more importantly,
tens of thousands of people joined the advocacy programs
and the activism programs
that we created to go around the movies.
And we had an online component of that,
our community sect called Participate.net.
But with our social sector partners, like the ACLU and PBS and the
Sierra Club and the NRDC, once people saw the film,
there was actually something they could do to make a difference.
kind of a box office disaster.
But it was a film that starred Charlize Theron
and it was about women's rights, women's empowerment,
domestic violence and so on.
And we released the film at the same time that
the Congress was debating the renewal of the Violence Against Women Act.
And with screenings on the Hill, and discussions,
and with our social sector partners,
like the National Organization of Women,
the film was widely credited
with influencing the successful renewal of the act.
And that to me, spoke volumes, because it's --
the film started about a true-life story
about a woman who was harassed, sued her employer,
led to a landmark case that led to the Equal Opportunity Act,
and the Violence Against Women Act and others.
And then the movie about this person doing these things,
then led to this greater renewal.
And so again,
it goes back to betting on good people doing good things.
I first saw Al do his slide show presentation
on global warming in May of 2005.
At that point, I thought I knew something about global warming.
I thought it was a 30 to 50 year problem.
And after we saw his slide show,
it became clear that it was much more urgent.
And so right afterwards, I met backstage with Al, and
with Lawrence Bender, who was there, and Laurie David,
and Davis Guggenheim,
who was running documentaries for Participant at the time.
And with Al's blessing, we decided on the spot to turn it into a film,
because we felt that we could get the message out there
far more quickly than having Al go around the world,
speaking to audiences of 100 or 200 at a time.
that nobody knows nothing about anything.
And I really thought this was going to be
a straight-to-PBS charitable initiative.
And so it was a great shock to all of us
when the film really captured the public interest,
and today is mandatory viewing in schools in England and Scotland,
and most of Scandinavia.
We've sent 50,000 DVDs to high school teachers in the U.S.
and it's really changed the debate on global warming.
It was also a pretty good year for this guy.
We now call Al the George Clooney of global warming.
(Laughter)
Everything we do looks at the major issues in the world.
And we have 10 films in production right now,
and dozens others in development.
I'll quickly talk about a few coming up.
One is "Charlie Wilson's War," with Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.
And it's the true story of Congressman Charlie Wilson, and
how he funded the Taliban to fight the Russians in Afghanistan.
And we're also doing a movie called "The Kite Runner,"
based on the book "The Kite Runner," also about Afghanistan.
And we think once people see these films,
they'll have a much better understanding of that part of the world
and the Middle East in general.
It's based on the protesters at the Democratic Convention in 1968,
Abby Hoffman and crew,
and, again, a story about a small group of individuals
who did make change in the world.
And a documentary that we're doing on Jimmy Carter
and his Mid-East peace efforts over the years.
And in particular, we've been following him on his recent book tour,
which, as many of you know, has been very non-controversial --
(Laughter)
-- which is really bad for getting people to come see a movie.
to make change in their own way.
And all the people in this room
have done so through their business lives,
or their philanthropic work, or their other interests.
And one thing that I've learned
is that there's never one right way to make change.
One can do it as a tech person, or as a finance person,
or a nonprofit person, or as an entertainment person,
but every one of us is all of those things and more.
we can close the opportunity gaps, we can close the hope gaps.
And I can imagine, if we do this,
the headlines in 10 years might read something like these:
"New AIDS Cases in Africa Fall to Zero,"
"U.S. Imports its Last Barrel of Oil" --
(Applause)
-- "Israelis and Palestinians Celebrate
10 Years of Peaceful Coexistence."
(Applause)
And I like this one, "Snow Has Returned to Kilimanjaro."
(Laughter)
And finally, an eBay listing for one well-traveled slide show,
now obsolete, museum piece. Please contact Al Gore.
And I believe that, working together,
we can make all of these things happen.
And I want to thank you all for having me here today.
It's been a real honor. Thank you.
(Applause)
Oh, thank you.
I live and work from Tokyo, Japan.
And I specialize in human behavioral research,
and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways,
and to design for that future.
And you know, to be honest, I've been doing this for seven years,
and I haven't got a clue what the future is going to be like.
But I've got a pretty good idea
It's not in the lab,
and it's increasingly in places like India, China, Brazil, Africa.
We live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people.
And it'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that.
And I mention this because,
if we want to design for that future,
we need to figure out what those people are about.
And that's, kind of, where I see what my job is
and what our team's job is.
So I'll give you an example. What do you carry?
If you think of everything in your life that you own,
when you walk out that door,
what do you consider to take with you?
When you're looking around, what do you consider?
Of that stuff, what do you carry?
And of that stuff, what do you actually use?
because the conscious and subconscious decision process
implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using
has some kind of spiritual, emotional or functional value.
And to put it really bluntly, you know,
people are willing to pay for stuff that has value, right?
So I've probably done about five years' research
looking at what people carry.
I go in people's bags. I look in people's pockets, purses.
I go in their homes. And we do this worldwide,
and we follow them around town with video cameras.
It's kind of like stalking with permission.
And we do all this -- and to go back to the original question,
OK, that's fair enough.
But if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are --
across cultures and across gender and across contexts --
most people will say keys, money
and, if they own one, a mobile phone.
And I'm not saying this is a good thing, but this is a thing, right?
I mean, I couldn't take your phones off you if I wanted to.
You'd probably kick me out, or something.
OK, it might seem like an obvious thing
for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask.
But really, the question is, why? Right?
So why are these things so important in our lives?
And it turns out, from our research, that it boils down to survival --
survival for us and survival for our loved ones.
Money is useful for buying food, sustenance,
among all its other uses.
And a mobile phone, it turns out, is a great recovery tool.
If you prefer this kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs,
those three objects are very good at supporting
the lowest rungs in Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
Yes, they do a whole bunch of other stuff,
but they're very good at this.
And in particular, it's the mobile phone's ability
to allow people to transcend space and time.
And what I mean by that is, you know,
And you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience,
and someone else can pick it up at their convenience.
And this is fairly universally appreciated, it turns out,
which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected.
And they value that connectivity.
And you can do them with phone kiosks.
And the mobile phone, in addition, is both personal --
and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it's convenient.
You don't need to ask permission from anyone,
you can just go ahead and do it, right?
But -- and it's a pretty big but -- we forget.
We're human, that's what we do. It's one of our features.
I think, quite a nice feature.
So we forget, but we're also adaptable,
and we adapt to situations around us pretty well.
And so we have these strategies to remember,
and one of them was mentioned yesterday.
And it's, quite simply, the point of reflection.
And that's that moment when you're walking out of a space,
and you turn around, and quite often you tap your pockets.
Even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets.
And you turn around, and you look back into the space,
and some people talk aloud.
And pretty much everyone does it at some point.
and what I mean is that you don't travel all the time, and always in hotels,
but most people have what we call a center of gravity.
And a center of gravity is where you keep these objects.
And these things don't stay in the center of gravity,
but over time, they gravitate there.
It's where you expect to find stuff.
And in fact, when you're turning around,
and you're looking inside the house,
and you're looking for this stuff,
this is where you look first, right?
OK, so when we did this research,
we found the absolutely, 100 percent, guaranteed way
to never forget anything ever, ever again.
And that is, quite simply, to have nothing to remember.
(Laughter)
But is, in fact, about the art of delegation.
And from a design perspective,
it's about understanding what you can delegate to technology
and what you can delegate to other people.
And it turns out, delegation -- if you want it to be --
can be the solution for pretty much everything,
apart from things like bodily functions, going to the toilet.
You can't ask someone to do that on your behalf.
And apart from things like entertainment,
you wouldn't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf,
or, at least, not yet.
Maybe sometime in the future, we will.
So this is -- probably the thing I'm most passionate about
is the research that we've been doing on illiteracy
and how people who are illiterate communicate.
So, the U.N. estimated -- this is 2004 figures --
that there are almost 800 million people who can't read and write, worldwide.
So, we've been conducting a lot of research.
And one of the things we were looking at is --
if you can't read and write,
if you want to communicate over distances,
Simple question: if you can't read and write,
how do you manage your contact information?
Just from a design perspective, we didn't really understand how they did it,
and so that's just one small example
of the kind of research that we were doing.
And it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation.
So they delegate that part of the task process to other people,
the stuff that they can't do themselves.
Let me give you another example of delegation.
This one's a little bit more sophisticated,
and this is from a study that we did in Uganda
about how people who are sharing devices, use those devices.
Sente is a word in Uganda that means money.
It has a second meaning, which is to send money as airtime. OK?
So let's say, June, you're in a village, rural village.
I'm in Kampala and I'm the wage earner.
I'm sending money back, and it works like this.
So, in your village, there's one person in the village with a phone,
and that's the phone kiosk operator.
And it's quite likely that they'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk.
So what I do is, I buy a prepaid card like this.
And instead of using that money to top up my own phone,
I call up the local village operator.
And I read out that number to them, and they use it to top up their phone.
So, they're topping up the value from Kampala,
and it's now being topped up in the village.
You take a 10 or 20 percent commission, and then you --
the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission,
and passes the rest over to you in cash.
So the first is, it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone --
anyone who has a mobile phone --
essentially into an ATM machine.
It brings rudimentary banking services to places
where there's no banking infrastructure.
And even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure,
they wouldn't necessarily be considered viable customers,
because they're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts.
There's a second thing I like about this.
And that is that despite all the resources at my disposal,
and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication,
I know I could never have designed something as elegant
and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this. OK?
But the difference between this and that
is, there's no central authority trying to control this.
This is just street-up innovation.
They'll probably give you three new ones, right?
I mean, that's buy three, get one free. That kind of thing.
If you go on the streets of India and China, you see this kind of stuff.
And this is where they take the stuff that breaks,
and they fix it, and they put it back into circulation.
and you can see people taking down a phone
and putting it back together.
They reverse-engineer manuals.
This is a kind of hacker's manual,
and it's written in Chinese and English.
They also write them in Hindi.
There are training institutes where they're churning out people
for fixing these things as well.
But what I like about this is,
it boils down to someone on the street with a small, flat surface,
a screwdriver, a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads --
because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge.
And it's all about the social network of the knowledge, floating around.
And I like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff,
and build stuff, and potentially distribute stuff.
Like, this is Viagra that I bought from a backstreet sex shop in China.
And China is a country where you get a lot of fakes.
And I know what you're asking -- did I test it?
I'm not going to answer that, OK.
But I look at something like this, and I consider the implications
of trust and confidence in the purchase process.
And we look at this and we think, well, how does that apply,
for example, for the design of -- the lessons from this --
apply to the design of online services, future services in these markets?
(Laughter) --
from Tibet.
And I look at something like this, and honestly, you know,
why would someone design underpants with a pocket, right?
And I look at something like this and it makes me question,
in some kind of personal area network,
how would we prioritize where to put stuff?
And yes, this is quite trivial, but actually the lessons from this can apply to that
kind of personal area networks.
And what you see here is a couple of phone numbers
written above the shack in rural Uganda.
This doesn't have house numbers. This has phone numbers.
So what does it mean when people's identity is mobile?
When those extra three billion people's identity is mobile, it isn't fixed?
Your notion of identity is out-of-date already, OK,
for those extra three billion people.
This is how it's shifting.
And this is from Delhi.
and it's a guy in a teashop.
You can see the chai being poured in the background.
And he's a, you know, incredibly poor teashop worker,
on the lowest rungs in the society.
And he, somehow, has the appreciation
of the values of Livestrong.
And it's not necessarily the same values,
but some kind of values of Livestrong,
to actually go out and purchase them,
and actually display them.
where everything is intertwined, and the dots are --
it's all about the dots joining together.
and it's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out
what it's going to be like when everyone on the planet
has the ability to transcend space and time
in a personal and convenient manner, right?
When everyone's connected.
So, the first thing is the immediacy of ideas,
the speed at which ideas go around.
And I know TED is about big ideas,
but actually, the benchmark for a big idea is changing.
If you want a big idea, you need to embrace everyone on the planet,
that's the first thing.
And what I mean by that is, as these become smaller,
as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater --
things like banking, identity --
these things quite simply move very quickly around the world.
And so the speed of the adoption of things
is just going to become that much more rapid,
in a way that we just totally cannot conceive,
when you get it to 6.3 billion
and the growth in the world's population.
carefully design this stuff --
the street will take it, and will figure out ways to innovate,
as long as it meets base needs --
In ways that, despite our resources, they can do it better than us.
That's my feeling.
And if we're smart, we'll look at this stuff that's going on,
and we'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse
both what we design and how we design.
With another three billion people connected,
they want to be part of the conversation.
And I think our relevance and TED's relevance
is really about embracing that and learning how to listen, essentially.
And we need to learn how to listen.
So thank you very, very much.
(Applause)
I hope you'll understand my English.
In the mornings it is terrible, and the afternoon is worst.
(Laughter)
During many years, I made some speeches starting with this
saying: "City is not a problem, it's a solution."
And more and more, I'm convinced that
it's not only a solution for a country,
but it's a solution for the problem of climate change.
I'm working in cities for almost 40 years,
and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big,
or the other mayors say, "We don't have financial resources,"
I would like to say
from the experience I had: every city in the world
can be improved in less than three years.
There's no matter of scale. It's not a question of scale,
it's not a question of financial resources.
Every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility
and also a design.
from a book I made for teenagers.
The best example of quality of life is the turtle
because the turtle is an example of living and working together.
And when you realize that the casque of the turtle
looks like an urban tessitura,
and can we imagine, if we cut the casque of the turtle, how sad she's going to be?
And that's what we're doing in our cities:
living here, working here, having leisure here.
And most of the people are leaving the city
and living outside of the city.
He is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave.
The chairs are on the tables and still drinking,
and he drinks a lot. (Laughter)
And he coughs a lot. Very egotistical:
he carries only one or two people
and he asks always for more infrastructure.
Freeways.
He's a very demanding person.
And on the other hand, Accordion, the friendly bus,
he carries 300 people --
275 in Sweden; 300 Brazilians. (Laughter)
Curitiba, my city: three million in the metropolitan area,
1,800,000 people in the city itself.
Curitiba, Rio: it's like two birds kissing themselves.
Oaxaca, San Francisco -- it's very easy:
Market Street, Van Ness and the waterfront.
And every city has its own design.
But to make it happen, sometimes you have to propose a scenario
and to propose a design --
an idea that everyone, or the large majority,
will help you to make it happen.
And that's the structure of the city of Curitiba.
And this is where we have more density;
it's where we have more public transport.
So, this system started in '74. We started with 25,000 passengers a day,
now it's 2,200,000 passengers a day.
And it took 25 years until another city ...
which is Bogota, and they did a very good job.
And now there's 83 cities all over the world that they
are doing what they call the BRT of Curitiba.
And one thing: it's important not for only your own city;
every city, besides its normal problems,
they have a very important role
in being with the whole humanity.
That means mostly two main issues --
mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities.
And we are very close to my house.
You can come when you are in Curitiba and have a coffee there.
And that's the evolution of the system.
What in the design that made the difference
is the boarding tubes:
the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway.
That's why, I'm trying to say,
it's like metro-nizing the bus.
This is the design of the bus,
and you can pay before entering the bus you're boarding.
And for handicapped, they can use this as a normal system.
the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars --
more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars, it's ...
-- that's why when we're talking about sustainability,
it's not enough, green buildings.
It's not enough, a new materials.
It's not enough, new sources of energy.
It's the concept of the city, the design of the city,
that's also important, too. And also, how to teach the children.
I'll speak on this later on.
to make the connections between all the systems.
We started in '83, proposing for the city of Rio
how to connect the subway with the bus.
The subway was against, of course.
And 23 years after, they called us to develop -- we're developing this idea.
And you can understand how different it's going to be,
the image of Rio with the system --
one-minute frequency.
And it's not Shanghai,
it's not being colored during the day, only at night
it will look this way.
we designed this in '83.
And this is the model,
how it's going to work. So, it's the same system;
the vehicle is different. And that's the model.
What I'm trying to say is, I'm not trying
to prove which system of transport is better.
I'm trying to say we have to combine
all the systems, and with one condition:
never -- if you have a subway, if you have surface systems,
if you have any kind of system --
never compete in the same space.
that the car is like your mother-in-law:
you have to have good relationship with her,
but she cannot command your life.
So, when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law,
you have a problem. (Laughter)
So, all the ideas about how to transform through design --
old quarries and open universities and botanic garden --
all of it's related to how we teach the children.
And the children, we teach during six months how to separate their garbage.
And after, the children teach their parents.
And now we have 70 percent --
since 20 years, it's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world.
Seven zero.
(Applause)
So teach the children.
we have to work with everything what's said,
but don't forget the cities and the children.
I'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city,
because you cannot have empty places during 18 hours a day.
You should have always
a structure of living and working together.
Try to understand the sectors in the city
that could play different roles during the 24 hours.
We don't rip our family portrait,
even if we don't like the nose of our uncle,
because this portrait is you.
And these are the references that we have in any city.
This is the main pedestrian mall;
we did it in 72 hours. Yes, you have to be fast.
And these are the references from our ethnic contribution.
This is the Italian portal,
the Ukrainian park, the Polish park, the Japanese square, the German park.
All of a sudden, the Soviet Union, they split.
And since we have people from
Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, [unclear],
we have to stop the program.
(Laughter)
If you cut two zeros, it's much better.
And this is the Wire Opera theater. We did it in two months.
Parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks.
Quarries once made the nature, and
sometimes we took this and we transformed.
And every part can be transformed;
every frog can be transformed in a prince.
Planning takes time. And I'm proposing urban acupuncture.
That means me, with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning.
And this is an acupuncture note --
or I.M. Pei's. Some small ones
can make the city better.
The smallest park in New York, the most beautiful:
32 meters.
that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials --
but keep in mind that we have to work fast
to the end, because we don't have the whole time to plan.
And I think creativity, innovation is starting.
And we cannot have all the answers.
So when you start --
and we cannot be so prepotent on having all the answers --
it's important starting and having the contribution from people,
and they could teach you
if you're not in the right track.
OK?
Please, allow me just two minutes.
You're going to make the music and the rhythm.
(Applause)
"No, seriously, what the hell is that island?"
When I talked to the kind rep from TED,
and I said, "Listen, you know, what should I talk about?"
He died in 1986. He was an amazing guy.
And one of the reasons he was amazing:
After World War II, he began an electronics company.
He started selling surplus parts, kits, to schools and stuff.
But it's an amazing gift to give a kid.
but he got me interested in all sorts of different odd crafts,
I'm obsessed with silk-screening and bookbinding and box making.
When I was a kid, I was always, like, taking apart boxes and stuff.
And I'm obsessed with engineering of paper.
He would also supply me with tools.
And in 1976, that was sort of an anomaly,
to be a 10-year-old kid that had access to a camera.
And you know, he was so generous; I couldn't believe it.
You don't understand. This is, like, I want to make movies.
She was fantastic.
And it let me make things, which, to me, was sort of the dream.
He sort of humored my obsession to other things too, like magic.
Which is good, but now I can't move.
Tannen's Mystery Magic Box.
The premise behind the Mystery Magic Box was the following:
but for some reason I haven't opened this box.
and bored people elsewhere.
It represents hope. It represents potential.
but when I started to think that maybe there are times
to write it, cast it, crew it, shoot it, cut it, post it, turn in a two-hour pilot.
just to show you some stuff that we did.
And part of that was the amazing availability of technology,
We might have been able to write it;
It needs to be filled with something fantastic.
So, you know, I love Apple computers.
It basically says, what are you going to write worthy of me?
you look at stories, you think, what are stories but mystery boxes?
He gets the droid, you see the holographic image.
You learn it's a message. She wants to find Obi Wan Kenobi.
Then there's the thing of mystery in terms of imagination --
the withholding of information.
You know, doing that intentionally is much more engaging.
Whether it's like the shark in "Jaws" --
Look at "E.T.," for example --
It's about a guy who's on the verge of divorce.
There's a half an hour of investment in character
before you get to the stuff that you're expecting.
This is one of my favorite scenes ever,
and this is a scene that you wouldn't necessarily think of
when you think of "Jaws." But it's an amazing scene.
which is the stuff that really is inside the box, you know?
And often, the movie's there and it's going,
I was signing on online in the morning to watch Steve Jobs' keynote,
and what was on the enormous iPod behind him?
The inspiration I get from the technology
What I've realized is what my grandfather did for me when I was a kid,
everyone has access to now.
And so, there's an amazing sense of opportunity out there.
who have been silenced in the past --
it's a very exciting thing.
to someone who wants to write, "Go! Write! Do your thing."
It's free, you don't need permission.
No community is best served when only the elite have control.
And I feel like this is an amazing opportunity
like these couple of moments I'll show you.
There's that.
So my favorite visual effect in the movie is the one I'm about to show you.
It's a scene in which Tom's character wakes up.
and so the hand that you see --
So ...
And the mystery box, in honor of my grandfather, stays closed.
justice, loyalty, violence, death, political and social issues,
My first question was, naturally:
She told us of little girls raped by men
the universal symbol of beauty and passion.
and ties it with her own hair.
Rose Mapendo and her nine children end up in Phoenix, Arizona,
I know them well.
Outside, there is a line of women
who have waited several hours to be treated.
Although women do two-thirds of the world's labor,
It is a fact that giving women education, work,
If families prosper, the village prospers,
and eventually, so does the whole country.
the soil is enriched, and the village is saved.
Yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments
In any war today, most of the casualties are civilians,
In our species, the alpha males define reality,
and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality
all this knowledge, energy, talent and technology.
Let's get off our fannies, roll up our sleeves
So, where are the robots?
We've been told for 40 years already that they're coming soon.
Very soon they'll be doing everything for us.
They'll be cooking, cleaning, buying things, shopping, building. But they aren't here.
Meanwhile, we have illegal immigrants doing all the work,
but we don't have any robots.
So what can we do about that? What can we say?
So I want to give a little bit of a different perspective
of how we can perhaps look at these things in a little bit of a different way.
And this is an x-ray picture
of a real beetle, and a Swiss watch, back from '88. You look at that --
what was true then is certainly true today.
We can still make the pieces. We can make the right pieces.
We can make the circuitry of the right computational power,
but we can't actually put them together to make something
that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems.
Let's summon the best designer, the mother of all designers.
Let's see what evolution can do for us.
So we threw in -- we created a primordial soup
with lots of pieces of robots -- with bars, with motors, with neurons.
Put them all together, and put all this under kind of natural selection,
under mutation, and rewarded things for how well they can move forward.
A very simple task, and it's interesting to see what kind of things came out of that.
come out of this. They all move around.
They all crawl in different ways, and you can see on the right,
that we actually made a couple of these things,
and they work in reality. These are not very fantastic robots,
but they evolved to do exactly what we reward them for:
but we can also do that on a real machine.
Here's a physical robot that we actually
have a population of brains,
competing, or evolving on the machine.
It's like a rodeo show. They all get a ride on the machine,
and they get rewarded for how fast or how far
they can make the machine move forward.
And you can see these robots are not ready
to take over the world yet, but
they gradually learn how to move forward,
and they do this autonomously.
machines that learned how to walk in simulation,
and also machines that learned how to walk in reality.
But I want to show you a different approach,
and this is this robot over here, which has four legs.
It has eight motors, four on the knees and four on the hip.
It has also two tilt sensors that tell the machine
which way it's tilting.
You look at it and you see it has four legs,
the machine doesn't know if it's a snake, if it's a tree,
it doesn't have any idea what it looks like,
but it's going to try to find that out.
Initially, it does some random motion,
and then it tries to figure out what it might look like.
And you're seeing a lot of things passing through its minds,
a lot of self-models that try to explain the relationship
between actuation and sensing. It then tries to do
a second action that creates the most disagreement
among predictions of these alternative models,
like a scientist in a lab. Then it does that
and tries to explain that, and prune out its self-models.
figured out what its self looks like. And once it has a self-model,
it can use that to derive a pattern of locomotion.
So what you're seeing here are a couple of machines --
a pattern of locomotion.
We were hoping that it wass going to have a kind of evil, spidery walk,
but instead it created this pretty lame way of moving forward.
that this machine did not do any physical trials on how to move forward,
nor did it have a model of itself.
It kind of figured out what it looks like, and how to move forward,
and then actually tried that out.
(Applause)
So that was what happened when we had a couple of --
that's what happened when you had a couple of -- OK, OK, OK --
(Laughter)
-- they don't like each other. So
there's a different robot.
That's what happened when the robots actually
are rewarded for doing something.
What happens if you don't reward them for anything, you just throw them in?
The cube can swivel, or flip on its side,
and we just throw 1,000 of these cubes into a soup --
this is in simulation --and don't reward them for anything,
we just let them flip. We pump energy into this
and see what happens in a couple of mutations.
So, initially nothing happens, they're just flipping around there.
But after a very short while, you can see these blue things
on the right there begin to take over.
the intrinsic reward is self-replication.
And we've actually built a couple of these,
and this is part of a larger robot made out of these cubes.
It's an accelerated view, where you can see the robot actually
carrying out some of its replication process.
So you're feeding it with more material -- cubes in this case --
and more energy, and it can make another robot.
So of course, this is a very crude machine,
but we're working on a micro-scale version of these,
and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in.
not very useful in themselves, but they might teach us something
about how we can build better robots,
and perhaps how humans, animals, create self-models and learn.
And one of the things that I think is important
is that we have to get away from this idea
of designing the machines manually,
but actually let them evolve and learn, like children,
and perhaps that's the way we'll get there. Thank you.
(Applause)
So, this is the short story of that research.
He stood over six feet tall.
what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth.
Our first study of people who were happily in love
We found activity in a tiny, little factory near the base of the brain
called the ventral tegmental area.
It's part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain,
Romantic love is an obsession, it possesses you.
for wanting, for motivation, for craving, for focus --
becomes more active when you can't get what you want.
What have I lost?
that I would like to tell the world?
Like hunger and thirst, it's almost impossible to stamp out."
You focus on the person, you obsessively think about them,
you crave them, you distort reality,
Not only did the instant craving come back,
Unless you're stuck in a laboratory cage --
As a matter of fact, ethologists know this.
There are over eight words for what they call "animal favoritism:"
selective proceptivity, mate choice, female choice, sexual choice.
which may only last for a second,
you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant.
And I think that this is really the origin
but it's really deepened my understanding
and compassion, really, for all human life.
As a matter of fact, in New York, I often catch myself
And in fact, sometimes I feel a little sorry
Our newest experiment has been hatched
We've put five people in so far,
still become active, 25 years later.
and asked about romantic love.
I never would have even thought to think of this,
but Match.com, the Internet dating site,
Your childhood certainly plays a role, but nobody knows how.
And that's about it, that's all they know.
I think we've evolved four very broad personality types
associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain.
to see to what degree you express these chemicals,
I'm putting the data together now,
I think there's biology to that.
I think we're going to end up, in the next few years,
to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms
that pull us to one person rather than another.
and this reminds me of it.
These are two women.
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do.
I told you three things last year.
I told you that the statistics of the world
have not been made properly available.
Because of that, we still have the old mindset
of developing in industrialized countries, which is wrong.
And that animated graphics can make a difference.
Things are changing
and today, on the United Nations Statistic Division Home Page,
it says, by first of May, full access to the databases.
(Applause)
And if I could share the image with you on the screen.
So three things have happened.
U.N. opened their statistic databases,
and we have a new version of the software
up working as a beta on the net,
so you don't have to download it any longer.
The bubbles are the countries.
Here you have the fertility rate -- the number of children per woman --
and there you have the length of life in years.
This is 1950 -- those were the industrialized countries,
those were developing countries.
At that time there was a "we" and "them."
There was a huge difference in the world.
But then it changed, and it went on quite well.
You can see how China is the red, big bubble.
The blue there is India.
And they go over all this -- I'm going to try to be
a little more serious this year in showing you
how things really changed.
And it's Africa that stands out as the problem down here, doesn't it?
Large families still, and the HIV epidemic
brought down the countries like this.
This is more or less what we saw last year,
and this is how it will go on into the future.
Because you see now, I presented statistics that don't exist.
Because this is where we are.
Will it be possible that this will happen?
I cover my lifetime here, you know?
I expect to live 100 years.
And this is where we are today.
Now could we look here instead at the economic situation in the world?
And I would like to show that against child survival.
We'll swap the axis.
Here you have child mortality -- that is, survival --
four kids dying there, 200 dying there.
And this is GDP per capita on this axis.
And this was 2007.
here we go, here we go, here we go -- not so much statistics 100 years ago.
Some countries still had statistics.
We are looking down in the archive,
and when we are down into 1820,
there is only Austria and Sweden that can produce numbers.
(Laughter)
But they were down here. They had 1,000 dollars per person per year.
And they lost one-fifth of their kids before their first birthday.
How they got slowly richer and richer,
and they add statistics.
Isn't it beautiful when they get statistics?
You see the importance of that?
And here, children don't live longer.
The last century, 1870, was bad for the kids in Europe,
because most of this statistics is Europe.
It was only by the turn of the century
that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year.
This is India coming up, with the first data from India.
And this is the United States moving away here, earning more money.
And we will soon see China coming up in the very far end corner here.
And it moves up with Mao Tse-Tung getting health,
not getting so rich.
There he died, then Deng Xiaoping brings money.
It moves this way over here.
And the bubbles keep moving up there,
and this is what the world looks like today.
(Applause)
We have a function here -- I can tell the world, "Stay where you are."
And I take the United States -- we still want to see the background --
I put them up like this, and now we go backwards.
And we can see that the United States
goes to the right of the mainstream.
They are on the money side all the time.
And down in 1915, the United States was a neighbor of India --
present, contemporary India.
And that means United States was richer,
but lost more kids than India is doing today, proportionally.
And look here -- compare to the Philippines of today.
The Philippines of today has almost the same economy
as the United States during the First World War.
But we have to bring United States forward quite a while
to find the same health of the United States
as we have in the Philippines.
About 1957 here, the health of the United States
is the same as the Philippines.
And this is the drama of this world which many call globalized,
is that Asia, Arabic countries, Latin America,
are much more ahead in being healthy, educated,
having human resources than they are economically.
in the emerging economies.
There now, social benefits, social progress,
are going ahead of economical progress.
And 1957 -- the United States had the same economy as Chile has today.
And how long do we have to bring United States
to get the same health as Chile has today?
I think we have to go, there -- we have 2001, or 2002 --
the United States has the same health as Chile.
Chile's catching up!
Within some years Chile may have better child survival
than the United States.
This is really a change, that you have this lag
of more or less 30, 40 years' difference on the health.
And there's a lot of infrastructure things,
and general human resources are there.
Now we can take away this --
and I would like to show you the rate of speed,
the rate of change, how fast they have gone.
And we go back to 1920, and I want to look at Japan.
And I want to look at Sweden and the United States.
And I'm going to stage a race here
between this sort of yellowish Ford here
and the red Toyota down there,
and the brownish Volvo.
(Laughter)
And here we go. Here we go.
The Toyota has a very bad start down here, you can see,
and the United States Ford is going off-road there.
And the Volvo is doing quite fine.
This is the war. The Toyota got off track, and now
the Toyota is coming on the healthier side of Sweden --
can you see that?
And they are taking over Sweden,
and they are now healthier than Sweden.
That's the part where I sold the Volvo and bought the Toyota.
(Laughter)
And now we can see that the rate of change was enormous in Japan.
They really caught up.
We have to look over generations to understand it.
And let me show you my own sort of family history --
we made these graphs here.
And this is the same thing, money down there, and health, you know?
And this is my family.
This is Sweden, 1830, when my great-great-grandma was born.
Sweden was like Sierra Leone today.
And this is when great-grandma was born, 1863.
And Sweden was like Mozambique.
And this is when my grandma was born, 1891.
She took care of me as a child,
so I'm not talking about statistic now --
now it's oral history in my family.
That's when I believe statistics,
when it's grandma-verified statistics.
(Laughter)
I think it's the best way of verifying historical statistics.
Sweden was like Ghana.
It's interesting to see the enormous diversity
within sub-Saharan Africa.
I told you last year, I'll tell you again,
my mother was born in Egypt, and I -- who am I?
I'm the Mexican in the family.
And my daughter, she was born in Chile,
and the grand-daughter was born in Singapore,
now the healthiest country on this Earth.
It bypassed Sweden about two to three years ago,
with better child survival.
But they're very small, you know?
They're so close to the hospital we can never
beat them out in these forests.
(Laughter)
But homage to Singapore.
Now this looks also like a very good story.
But it's not really that easy, that it's all a good story.
Because I have to show you one of the other facilities.
We can also make the color here represent the variable --
and what am I choosing here?
Carbon-dioxide emission, metric ton per capita.
This is 1962, and United States was emitting 16 tons per person.
And China was emitting 0.6,
and India was emitting 0.32 tons per capita.
And what happens when we moved on?
Well, you see the nice story of getting richer
and getting healthier --
everyone did it at the cost of emission of carbon dioxide.
There is no one who has done it so far.
And we don't have all the updated data
any longer, because this is really hot data today.
And there we are, 2001.
many say now the problem is that the emerging economies,
they are getting out too much carbon dioxide.
The Minister of the Environment of India said,
"Well, you were the one who caused the problem."
The OECD countries -- the high-income countries --
they were the ones who caused the climate change.
"But we forgive you, because you didn't know it.
But from now on, we count per capita.
From now on we count per capita.
And everyone is responsible for the per capita emission."
and health progress anywhere in the world
without destroying the climate.
And this is really what has to be changed.
I've been criticized for showing you a too positive image of the world,
but I don't think it's like this.
The world is quite a messy place.
This we can call Dollar Street.
Everyone lives on this street here.
What they earn here -- what number they live on --
is how much they earn per day.
This family earns about one dollar per day.
We drive up the street here,
we find a family here which earns about two to three dollars a day.
And we drive away here -- we find the first garden in the street,
and they earn 10 to 50 dollars a day.
If we look at the bed here, we can see
that they sleep on a rug on the floor.
This is what poverty line is --
80 percent of the family income is just to cover the energy needs,
the food for the day.
This is two to five dollars. You have a bed.
And here it's a much nicer bedroom, you can see.
I lectured on this for Ikea, and they wanted to see
the sofa immediately here.
(Laughter)
And this is the sofa, how it will emerge from there.
And the interesting thing, when you go around here in the photo panorama,
you see the family still sitting on the floor there.
Although there is a sofa,
if you watch in the kitchen, you can see that
the great difference for women does not come between one to 10 dollars.
It comes beyond here, when you really can get
good working conditions in the family.
And if you really want to see the difference,
you look at the toilet over here.
This can change. This can change.
These are all pictures and images from Africa,
and it can become much better.
We can get out of poverty.
I spent 20 years in interviews with African farmers
who were on the verge of famine.
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research.
The nice thing here is that you can't see
who are the researchers in this picture.
That's when research functions in poor societies --
you must really live with the people.
It's about having food.
And these two young farmers, they are girls now --
because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS --
they discuss with a trained agronomist.
This is one of the best agronomists in Malawi, Junatambe Kumbira,
and he's discussing what sort of cassava they will plant --
the best converter of sunshine to food that man has found.
And they are very, very eagerly interested to get advice,
and that's to survive in poverty.
That's one context.
Getting out of poverty.
The women told us one thing. "Get us technology.
We hate this mortar, to stand hours and hours.
Get us a mill so that we can mill our flour,
then we will be able to pay for the rest ourselves."
Technology will bring you out of poverty,
but there's a need for a market to get away from poverty.
And this woman is very happy now, bringing her products to the market.
But she's very thankful for the public investment in schooling
so she can count, and won't be cheated when she reaches the market.
She wants her kid to be healthy, so she can go to the market
and doesn't have to stay home.
And she wants the infrastructure -- it is nice with a paved road.
It's also good with credit.
Micro-credits gave her the bicycle, you know.
And information will tell her when to go to market with which product.
You can do this.
the seemingly impossible is possible.
Africa has not done bad.
In 50 years they've gone from a pre-Medieval situation
to a very decent 100-year-ago Europe,
with a functioning nation and state.
I would say that sub-Saharan Africa has done best in the world
during the last 50 years.
Because we don't consider where they came from.
It's this stupid concept of developing countries
that puts us, Argentina and Mozambique together 50 years ago,
and says that Mozambique did worse.
We have to know a little more about the world.
I have a neighbor who knows 200 types of wine.
He knows everything.
He knows the name of the grape, the temperature and everything.
I only know two types of wine -- red and white.
(Laughter)
But my neighbor only knows two types of countries --
industrialized and developing.
And I know 200, I know about the small data.
But you can do that.
(Applause)
You make a PowerPoint, you know?
(Laughter)
Homage to the Office package, no?
What is this, what is this, what am I telling?
I'm telling you that there are many dimensions of development.
Everyone wants your pet thing.
If you are in the corporate sector, you love micro-credit.
If you are fighting in a non-governmental organization,
you love equity between gender.
Or if you are a teacher, you'll love UNESCO, and so on.
On the global level, we have to have more than our own thing.
We need everything.
All these things are important for development,
especially when you just get out of poverty
and you should go towards welfare.
is, what is a goal for development,
and what are the means for development?
Let me first grade what are the most important means.
Economic growth to me, as a public-health professor,
is the most important thing for development
because it explains 80 percent of survival.
Governance. To have a government which functions --
that's what brought California out of the misery of 1850.
It was the government that made law function finally.
Education, human resources are important.
Health is also important, but not that much as a mean.
Environment is important.
Human rights is also important, but it just gets one cross.
We are not interested in money.
Money is not a goal.
It's the best mean, but I give it zero as a goal.
Governance, well it's fun to vote in a little thing,
but it's not a goal.
And going to school, that's not a goal, it's a mean.
Health I give two points. I mean it's nice to be healthy
-- at my age especially -- you can stand here, you're healthy.
And that's good, it gets two plusses.
Environment is very, very crucial.
There's nothing for the grandkid if you don't save up.
But where are the important goals?
Of course, it's human rights.
Human rights is the goal,
but it's not that strong of a mean for achieving development.
And culture. Culture is the most important thing, I would say,
because that's what brings joy to life.
That's the value of living.
Even African countries can achieve this.
And I've shown you the shot where the seemingly impossible is possible.
And remember, please remember my main message,
which is this: the seemingly impossible is possible.
We can have a good world.
I showed you the shots, I proved it in the PowerPoint,
and I think I will convince you also by culture.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Bring me my sword!
Sword swallowing is from ancient India.
It's a cultural expression that for thousands of years
has inspired human beings to think beyond the obvious.
(Laughter)
And I will now prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible
by taking this piece of steel -- solid steel --
this is the army bayonet from the Swedish Army, 1850,
in the last year we had war.
And it's all solid steel -- you can hear here.
And I'm going to take this blade of steel,
and push it down through my body of blood and flesh,
and prove to you that the seemingly impossible is possible.
Can I request a moment of absolute silence?
(Applause)
So I want to talk to you today about AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa.
is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa
that has had success in combating the epidemic.
the ABC campaign -- they decreased their prevalence in the 1990s
from about 15 percent to 6 percent over just a few years.
If you follow policy, you probably know that a few years ago
the president pledged 15 billion dollars to fight the epidemic over five years,
and a lot of that money is going to go to programs that try to replicate Uganda
and use behavior change to encourage people and decrease the epidemic.
that you might not know about the epidemic,
and I'm actually also going to challenge
some of these things that you think that you do know.
To do that I'm going to talk about my research
as an economist on the epidemic.
And I'm not really going to talk much about the economy.
I'm not going to tell you about exports and prices.
But I'm going to use tools and ideas that are familiar to economists
to think about a problem that's more traditionally
part of public health and epidemiology.
And probably for most people in this room, that's how you think about it.
It's going to be about thinking about how it evolves, and how people respond to it.
I think it may seem like I'm ignoring the policy stuff,
which is really the most important,
but I'm hoping that at the end of this talk you will conclude
that we actually cannot develop effective policy
unless we really understand how the epidemic works.
the first thing I think we need to understand is:
how do people respond to the epidemic?
So AIDS is a sexually transmitted infection, and it kills you.
So this means that in a place with a lot of AIDS,
there's a really significant cost of sex.
If you're an uninfected man living in Botswana, where the HIV rate is 30 percent,
if you have one more partner this year -- a long-term partner, girlfriend, mistress --
your chance of dying in 10 years increases by three percentage points.
And so I think that we really feel like then people should have less sex.
And in fact among gay men in the US
we did see that kind of change in the 1980s.
So if we look in this particularly high-risk sample, they're being asked,
"Did you have more than one unprotected sexual partner in the last two months?"
Over a period from '84 to '88, that share drops from about 85 percent to 55 percent.
It's a huge change in a very short period of time.
So we don't have quite as good data, but you can see here
the share of single men having pre-marital sex,
or married men having extra-marital sex,
and how that changes from the early '90s to late '90s,
and late '90s to early 2000s. The epidemic is getting worse.
People are learning more things about it.
We see almost no change in sexual behavior.
These are just tiny decreases -- two percentage points -- not significant.
and that to understand this you need to think about health
the way than an economist does -- as an investment.
So if you're a software engineer and you're trying to think about
whether to add some new functionality to your program,
it's important to think about how much it costs.
It's also important to think about what the benefit is.
If version 10 is coming out next week,
there's no point in adding more functionality into version nine.
Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie,
every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies,
that's a costly investment in your health.
But how much you want to invest is going to depend
on how much longer you expect to live in the future,
even if you don't make those investments.
AIDS is the same kind of thing. It's costly to avoid AIDS.
People really like to have sex.
But, you know, it has a benefit in terms of future longevity.
But life expectancy in Africa, even without AIDS, is really, really low:
40 or 50 years in a lot of places.
I think it's possible, if we think about that intuition, and think about that fact,
that maybe that explains some of this low behavior change.
And a great way to test that is to look across areas in Africa and see:
do people with more life expectancy change their sexual behavior more?
And the way that I'm going to do that is,
I'm going to look across areas with different levels of malaria.
So malaria is a disease that kills you.
It's a disease that kills a lot of adults in Africa, in addition to a lot of children.
And so people who live in areas with a lot of malaria
are going to have lower life expectancy than people who live in areas with limited malaria.
So one way to test to see whether we can explain
some of this behavior change by differences in life expectancy
is to look and see is there more behavior change
in areas where there's less malaria.
This shows you -- in areas with low malaria, medium malaria, high malaria --
what happens to the number of sexual partners as you increase HIV prevalence.
If you look at the blue line,
the areas with low levels of malaria, you can see in those areas,
actually, the number of sexual partners is decreasing a lot
as HIV prevalence goes up.
Areas with medium levels of malaria it decreases some --
it doesn't decrease as much. And areas with high levels of malaria --
actually, it's increasing a little bit, although that's not significant.
Young women who live in areas with high maternal mortality
change their behavior less in response to HIV
than young women who live in areas with low maternal mortality.
There's another risk, and they respond less to this existing risk.
It tells us something about why we see limited behavior change in Africa.
Even if you only cared about AIDS in Africa,
it might still be a good idea to invest in malaria,
in combating poor indoor air quality,
in improving maternal mortality rates.
Because if you improve those things,
then people are going to have an incentive to avoid AIDS on their own.
But it also tells us something about one of these facts that we talked about before.
Education campaigns, like the one that the president is focusing on in his funding,
may not be enough, at least not alone.
If people have no incentive to avoid AIDS on their own,
even if they know everything about the disease,
they still may not change their behavior.
People aren't changing their behavior enough
to decrease the growth in the epidemic.
So we're going to need to think about policy
and what kind of policies might be effective.
The reason that we know that the ABC campaign
was effective in Uganda is we have good data on prevalence over time.
In Uganda we see the prevalence went down.
We know they had this campaign. That's how we learn about what works.
It's not the only place we had any interventions.
Other places have tried things, so why don't we look at those places
and see what happened to their prevalence?
on HIV prevalence in the general population in Africa until about 2003.
So if I asked you, "Why don't you go and find me
the prevalence in Burkina Faso in 1991?"
You get on Google, you Google, and you find,
actually the only people tested in Burkina Faso in 1991
are STD patients and pregnant women,
which is not a terribly representative group of people.
Then if you poked a little more, you looked a little more at what was going on,
you'd find that actually that was a pretty good year,
because in some years the only people tested are IV drug users.
But even worse -- some years it's only IV drug users,
some years it's only pregnant women.
We have no way to figure out what happened over time.
We have no consistent testing.
In Kenya, in Zambia, and a bunch of countries,
there's been testing in random samples of the population.
But this leaves us with a big gap in our knowledge.
So I can tell you what the prevalence was in Kenya in 2003,
but I can't tell you anything about 1993 or 1983.
And I started thinking about how else might we figure out
what the prevalence of HIV was in Africa in the past.
And I think that the answer is, we can look at mortality data,
and we can use mortality data to figure out what the prevalence was in the past.
that AIDS is a very specific kind of disease.
It kills people in the prime of their lives.
Not a lot of other diseases have that profile. And you can see here --
this is a graph of death rates by age in Botswana and Egypt.
Botswana is a place with a lot of AIDS,
Egypt is a place without a lot of AIDS.
And you see they have pretty similar death rates among young kids and old people.
That suggests it's pretty similar levels of development.
the death rates in Botswana are much, much, much higher than in Egypt.
But since there are very few other diseases that kill people,
we can really attribute that mortality to HIV.
But because people who died this year of AIDS got it a few years ago,
we can use this data on mortality to figure out what HIV prevalence was in the past.
So it turns out, if you use this technique,
actually your estimates of prevalence are very close
to what we get from testing random samples in the population,
but they're very, very different than what UNAIDS tells us the prevalences are.
and prevalence based on the mortality data
for the years in the late 1990s in nine countries in Africa.
You can see, almost without exception,
the UNAIDS estimates are much higher than the mortality-based estimates.
UNAIDS tell us that the HIV rate in Zambia is 20 percent,
and mortality estimates suggest it's only about 5 percent.
And these are not trivial differences in mortality rates.
So this is another way to see this.
You can see that for the prevalence to be as high as UNAIDS says,
we have to really see 60 deaths per 10,000
rather than 20 deaths per 10,000 in this age group.
about how we can use this kind of information to learn something
that's going to help us think about the world.
But this also tells us that one of these facts
that I mentioned in the beginning may not be quite right.
If you think that 25 million people are infected,
if you think that the UNAIDS numbers are much too high,
maybe that's more like 10 or 15 million.
It doesn't mean that AIDS isn't a problem. It's a gigantic problem.
But it does suggest that that number might be a little big.
What I really want to do, is I want to use this new data
to try to figure out what makes the HIV epidemic grow faster or slower.
When I started working on these projects,
I was not thinking at all about economics,
but eventually it kind of sucks you back in.
So I am going to talk about exports and prices.
And I want to talk about the relationship between economic activity,
in particular export volume, and HIV infections.
with the fact that development, that openness to trade,
is really good for developing countries.
It's good for improving people's lives.
But openness and inter-connectedness, it comes with a cost
when we think about disease. I don't think this should be a surprise.
On Wednesday, I learned from Laurie Garrett
that I'm definitely going to get the bird flu,
and I wouldn't be at all worried about that
if we never had any contact with Asia.
The epidemic was introduced to the US
by actually one male steward on an airline flight,
who got the disease in Africa and brought it back.
And that was the genesis of the entire epidemic in the US.
In Africa, epidemiologists have noted for a long time
that truck drivers and migrants are more likely to be infected than other people.
Areas with a lot of economic activity --
with a lot of roads, with a lot of urbanization --
those areas have higher prevalence than others.
that if we gave people more exports, more trade, that that would increase prevalence.
By using this new data, using this information about prevalence over time,
we can actually test that. And so it seems to be --
fortunately, I think -- it seems to be the case
that these things are positively related.
More exports means more AIDS. And that effect is really big.
So the data that I have suggests that if you double export volume,
it will lead to a quadrupling of new HIV infections.
From a forecasting perspective, if we know where trade is likely to change,
for example, because of the African Growth and Opportunities Act
or other policies that encourage trade,
we can actually think about which areas are likely to be heavily infected with HIV.
And we can go and we can try to have pre-emptive preventive measures there.
Likewise, as we're developing policies to try to encourage exports,
if we know there's this externality --
this extra thing that's going to happen as we increase exports --
we can think about what the right kinds of policies are.
Even though it is the case that poverty is linked to AIDS,
in the sense that Africa is poor and they have a lot of AIDS,
it's not necessarily the case that improving poverty -- at least in the short run,
that improving exports and improving development --
it's not necessarily the case that that's going to lead
to a decline in HIV prevalence.
the special case of Uganda, and the fact that
it's the only country in sub-Saharan Africa with successful prevention.
It's been widely heralded.
It's been replicated in Kenya, and Tanzania, and South Africa and many other places.
But now I want to actually also question that.
Because it is true that there was a decline in prevalence
in Uganda in the 1990s. It's true that they had an education campaign.
But there was actually something else that happened in Uganda in this period.
Coffee is Uganda's major export.
Their exports went down a lot in the early 1990s -- and actually that decline lines up
really, really closely with this decline in new HIV infections.
So you can see that both of these series --
the black line is export value, the red line is new HIV infections --
you can see they're both increasing.
Starting about 1987 they're both going down a lot.
And then actually they track each other
a little bit on the increase later in the decade.
with some of the data that I talked about before,
it suggests that somewhere between 25 percent and 50 percent
of the decline in prevalence in Uganda
actually would have happened even without any education campaign.
We're spending so much money to try to replicate this campaign.
And if it was only 50 percent as effective as we think that it was,
then there are all sorts of other things
maybe we should be spending our money on instead.
Trying to change transmission rates by treating other sexually transmitted diseases.
Trying to change them by engaging in male circumcision.
There are tons of other things that we should think about doing.
And maybe this tells us that we should be thinking more about those things.
and I hope that I've gotten you questioning a little bit
some of the things that you did know.
And I hope that I've convinced you maybe
that it's important to understand things about the epidemic
in order to think about policy.
And when I leave here, I'm going to go back
and sit in my tiny office, and my computer, and my data.
And the thing that's most exciting about that
is every time I think about research, there are more questions.
There are more things that I think that I want to do.
And what's really, really great about being here
is I'm sure that the questions that you guys have
are very, very different than the questions that I think up myself.
And I can't wait to hear about what they are.
So thank you very much.
So, indeed, I have spent my life
Waking up with Abraham Lincoln in the morning,
thinking of Franklin Roosevelt when I went to bed at night.
But when I try and think about what I've learned
about the meaning in life, my mind keeps wandering back
to a seminar that I took when I was a graduate student at Harvard
with the great psychologist Erik Erikson.
attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms:
work, love and play.
And that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other,
is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age.
Whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication,
is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement,
but with serenity.
on the lives of two of the presidents I've studied to illustrate this point --
Abraham Lincoln and Lyndon Johnson.
As for that first sphere of work,
I think what Abraham Lincoln's life suggests
is that fierce ambition is a good thing.
He had a huge ambition.
But it wasn't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame --
what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life
so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it.
He somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm
from which he was born.
No schooling was possible for him,
except a few weeks here, a few weeks there.
But he read books in every spare moment he could find.
It was said when he got a copy of the King James Bible
or "Aesop's Fables," he was so excited he couldn't sleep.
He couldn't eat.
The great poet Emily Dickinson once said,
"There is no frigate like a book to take us lands away."
How true for Lincoln.
he went with Lord Byron's poetry to Spain and Portugal.
Literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings.
But there were so many losses in his early life
that he was haunted by death.
His mother died when he was only nine years old;
his only sister, Sarah, in childbirth a few years later;
and his first love, Ann Rutledge, at the age of 22.
Moreover, when his mother lay dying,
she did not hold out for him the hope
that they would meet in an afterworld.
She simply said to him,
"Abraham, I'm going away from you now, and I shall never return."
As a result he became obsessed with the thought
that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust.
a certain consolation from an ancient Greek notion --
but followed by other cultures as well --
that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life,
you could live on in the memory of others.
Your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence.
And that worthy ambition became his lodestar.
It carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered
when he was in his early 30s.
He had broken his engagement with Mary Todd,
not certain he was ready to marry her,
but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that.
His one intimate friend, Joshua Speed, was leaving Illinois
to go back to Kentucky because Speed's father had died.
And his political career in the state legislature
was on a downward slide.
He was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal.
They took all knives and razors and scissors from his room.
And his great friend Speed went to his side and said,
"Lincoln, you must rally or you will die."
He said that, "I would just as soon die right now,
but I've not yet done anything to make any human being
remember that I have lived."
He eventually won a seat in Congress.
He then ran twice for the Senate, lost twice.
"Everyone is broken by life," Ernest Hemingway once said,
"but some people are stronger in the broken places."
So then he surprised the nation with an upset victory
for the presidency over three far more experienced,
far more educated, far more celebrated rivals.
And then when he won the general election,
he stunned the nation even more
by appointing each of these three rivals into his Cabinet.
It was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought,
"He'll look like a figurehead compared to these people."
They said, "Why are you doing this, Lincoln?"
He said, "Look, these are the strongest
and most able men in the country.
The country is in peril. I need them by my side."
But perhaps my old friend Lyndon Johnson
might have put it in less noble fashion:
"Better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out,
than outside the tent pissing in."
(Laughter)
would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team.
For each of them soon came to understand
that he possessed an unparalleled array of
emotional strengths and political skills
that proved far more important than the thinness of his external résumé.
For one thing, he possessed an uncanny ability
to empathize with and to think about other peoples' point of view.
He repaired injured feelings that might have escalated
into permanent hostility.
He shared credit with ease,
assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates,
constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes.
These are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008.
(Applause)
He refused to be provoked by petty grievances.
He never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights.
And he expressed his unshakeable convictions
in everyday language, in metaphors, in stories.
And with a beauty of language -- almost as if
the Shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child
had worked their way into his very soul.
he brought his old friend, Joshua Speed, back to the White House,
and remembered that conversation of decades before, when he was so sad.
And he, pointing to the Proclamation, said,
"I believe, in this measure, my fondest hopes will be realized."
But as he was about to put his signature on the Proclamation
his own hand was numb and shaking
because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a New Year's reception.
So he put the pen down.
He said, "If ever my soul were in an act, it is in this act.
But if I sign with a shaking hand,
posterity will say, 'He hesitated.'"
So he waited until he could take up the pen
and sign with a bold and clear hand.
But even in his wildest dreams,
Lincoln could never have imagined
how far his reputation would reach.
Leo Tolstoy, in a New York newspaper in the early 1900s.
And in it, Tolstoy told of a trip that he'd recently made
to a very remote area of the Caucasus,
where there were only wild barbarians,
who had never left this part of Russia.
Knowing that Tolstoy was in their midst,
they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history.
So he said, "I told them about Napoleon
and Alexander the Great and Frederick the Great
and Julius Caesar, and they loved it.
But before I finished, the chief of the barbarians stood up and said,
'But wait, you haven't told us about the greatest ruler of them all.
We want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder,
who laughed like the sunrise,
who came from that place called America, which is so far from here,
that if a young man should travel there,
he would be an old man when he arrived.
Tell us of that man. Tell us of Abraham Lincoln.'"
He was stunned.
He told them everything he could about Lincoln.
And then in the interview he said, "What made Lincoln so great?
Not as great a general as Napoleon,
not as great a statesman as Frederick the Great."
But his greatness consisted, and historians would roundly agree,
in the integrity of his character
and the moral fiber of his being.
that had carried Lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized.
That ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself,
to go through that string of political failures
and the darkest days of the war.
His story would be told.
So as for that second sphere, not of work, but of love --
encompassing family, friends and colleagues --
it, too, takes work and commitment.
The Lyndon Johnson that I saw in the last years of his life,
when I helped him on his memoirs,
was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of
work, power and individual success,
that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left
to get him through the days
once the presidency was gone.
I was selected as a White House Fellow when I was 24 years old.
We had a big dance at the White House.
President Johnson did dance with me that night.
Not that peculiar --
there were only three women out of the 16 White House Fellows.
But he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me
to work directly for him in the White House.
But it was not to be that simple.
For in the months leading up to my selection,
like many young people, I'd been active
in the anti-Vietnam War movement,
and had written an article against Lyndon Johnson,
which unfortunately came out in The New Republic
two days after the dance in the White House.
(Laugher)
And the theme of the article was how to remove Lyndon Johnson from power.
(Laughter)
So I was certain he would kick me out of the program.
But instead, surprisingly, he said,
"Oh, bring her down here for a year,
and if I can't win her over, no one can."
So I did end up working for him in the White House.
Eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs,
never fully understanding why he'd chosen me to spend so many hours with.
He was a great storyteller.
Fabulous, colorful, anecdotal stories.
There was a problem with these stories, however,
which I later discovered, which is that half of them weren't true.
But they were great, nonetheless.
(Laughter)
So I think that part of his attraction for me was that I loved listening to his tall tales.
But I also worried that part of it was that I was then a young woman.
And he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation.
So I constantly chatted to him about boyfriends,
even when I didn't have any at all.
until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship.
Sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake,
conveniently called Lake Lyndon Baines Johnson.
And there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth --
all the romantic trappings.
And he started out,
"Doris, more than any other woman I have ever known ... "
And my heart sank.
And then he said,
"You remind me of my mother."
(Laughter)
But I must say, the older I've gotten,
the more I realize what an incredible privilege it was
to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man.
A victor in a thousand contests,
three great civil rights laws, Medicare, aid to education.
And yet, roundly defeated in the end by the war in Vietnam.
And because he was so sad and so vulnerable,
he opened up to me in ways he never would have
had I known him at the height of his power --
sharing his fears, his sorrows and his worries.
And I'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me
the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure,
that I've tried to bring to each of my books since then.
which Erik Erikson had tried to instill in all of us
about the importance of finding balance in life.
For on the surface, Lyndon Johnson should have had
everything in the world to feel good about in those last years,
in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency;
he had all the money he needed to pursue
any leisure activity he wanted;
he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside, a penthouse in the city,
sailboats, speedboats.
He had servants to answer any whim,
and he had a family who loved him deeply.
meant that in his retirement he could find no solace
in family, in recreation, in sports or in hobbies.
It was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large
that even the love of a family, without work, could not fill it.
As his spirits sagged, his body deteriorated
until, I believe, he slowly brought about his own death.
In those last years, he said he was so sad
watching the American people look toward a new president and forgetting him.
He spoke with immense sadness in his voice,
saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children,
and their children in turn.
But it was too late.
Despite all that power, all that wealth,
he was alone when he finally died --
his ultimate terror realized.
which he never had learned to enjoy,
I've learned over the years
that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy --
enough so that a hobby, a sport, a love of music,
or art, or literature, or any form of recreation,
can provide true pleasure, relaxation and replenishment.
So deep, for instance, was Abraham Lincoln's love of Shakespeare,
that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater,
even during those dark days of the war.
He said, when the lights went down and a Shakespeare play came on,
for a few precious hours he could imagine himself
back in Prince Hal's time.
that Lyndon Johnson never could enjoy,
was a love of -- somehow -- humor,
and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce
as a sidelight to the sadness.
He once said that he laughed so he did not cry,
that a good story, for him, was better than a drop of whiskey.
His storytelling powers had first been recognized
when he was on the circuit in Illinois.
The lawyers and the judges would travel
from one county courthouse to the other,
and when anyone was knowing Lincoln was in town,
they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories.
He would stand with his back against a fire
and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales.
And all these stories became part of his memory bank,
so he could call on them whenever he needed to.
And they're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument.
had to do with the Revolutionary War hero, Ethan Allen.
And as Lincoln told the story,
Mr. Allen went to Britain after the war.
And the British people were still upset
about losing the Revolution,
so they decided to embarrass him a little bit
by putting a huge picture of General Washington
in the only outhouse, where he'd have to encounter it.
They figured he'd be upset about the indignity
of George Washington being in an outhouse.
But he came out of the outhouse not upset at all.
And so they said, "Well, did you see George Washington in there?"
"Oh, yes," he said, "perfectly appropriate place for him."
"What do you mean?" they said.
"Well," he said, "there's nothing to make an Englishman shit
faster than the sight of General George Washington."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
and he had hundreds of these stories --
you would have to relax.
So between his nightly treks to the theater,
his story telling, and his extraordinary sense of humor
and his love of quoting Shakespeare and poetry,
he found that form of play which carried him through his days.
In my own life, I shall always be grateful
for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball.
Which allows me, from the beginning of spring training
to the end of the fall,
to have something to occupy my mind and heart
other than my work.
and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score
while listening to baseball games --
so that when he went to work in New York during the day,
I could record for him the history of that afternoon's
Brooklyn Dodgers game.
Now, when you're only six years old,
and your father comes home every single night
and listens to you -- as I now realize that I, in excruciating detail,
recounted every single play of every inning
of the game that had just taken place that afternoon.
But he made me feel I was telling him a fabulous story.
It makes you think there's something magic about history
to keep your father's attention.
from those nightly sessions with my father.
Because at first, I'd be so excited I would blurt out,
"The Dodgers won!" or, "The Dodgers lost!"
Which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away.
(Laughter)
So I finally learned you had to tell a story
from beginning to middle to end.
I must say, so fervent was my love
of the old Brooklyn Dodgers in those days
that I had to confess in my first confession
two sins that related to baseball.
came to my hometown of Rockville Centre, Long Island,
just as I was in preparation for my first Holy Communion.
And I was so excited --
first person I'd ever see outside of Ebbets Field.
But it so happened he was speaking in a Protestant Church.
When you are brought up as a Catholic, you think
that if you ever set foot in a Protestant Church,
you'll be struck dead at the threshold.
So I went to my father in tears, "What are we going to do?"
He said, "Don't worry. He's speaking in a parish hall.
We're sitting in folding chairs. He's talking about sportsmanship.
It's not a sin."
But as I left that night, I was certain that somehow
I'd traded the life of my everlasting soul
for this one night with Roy Campanella.
(Laughter)
And there were no indulgences around that I could buy.
So I had this sin on my soul when I went to my first confession.
I told the priest right away.
He said, "No problem. It wasn't a religious service."
But then, unfortunately, he said, "And what else, my child?"
I tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church,
wishing harm to others, being mean to my sisters.
And he said, "To whom did you wish harm?"
And I had to say that I wished that various New York Yankees players
would break arms, legs and ankles --
(Laughter)
-- so that the Brooklyn Dodgers could win their first World Series.
He said, "How often do you make these horrible wishes?"
And I had to say, every night when I said my prayers.
(Laughter)
So he said, "Look, I'll tell you something.
I love the Brooklyn Dodgers, as you do,
but I promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely.
You do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen."
"Oh yes," I said.
But luckily, my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest!
(Laughter)
when I was still in my 20s,
before I had gotten married and had my three sons,
I have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys.
Though when the Dodgers abandoned us to come to L.A.,
I lost faith in baseball until I moved to Boston
and became an irrational Red Sox fan.
And I must say, even now, when I sit with my sons
with our season tickets,
I can sometimes close my eyes against the sun
and imagine myself, a young girl once more, in the presence of my father,
watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below:
Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese, and Duke Snider.
When I open my eyes and I see my sons
in the place where my father once sat,
I feel an invisible loyalty and love
linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see,
but whose heart and soul they have come to know
through all the stories I have told.
Which is why, in the end, I shall always be grateful for this curious love of history,
allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past.
Allowing me to learn from these large figures
about the struggle for meaning for life.
Allowing me to believe that the private people
we have loved and lost in our families,
and the public figures we have respected in our history,
just as Abraham Lincoln wanted to believe,
really can live on, so long as we pledge
to tell and to retell the stories of their lives.
Thank you for letting me be that storyteller today.
(Applause)
Thank you.
One way to change our genes is to make new ones,
as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown.
Another is to change our lifestyles.
And what we're learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be,
that you don't have to wait very long to see the benefits.
When you eat healthier, manage stress, exercise and love more,
your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen.
But more than that, your brain gets measurably bigger.
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago
can actually be measured now.
This was figured out by Robin Williams
a few years before the rest of us.
to make your brain grow new brain cells.
Some of my favorite things, like chocolate and tea, blueberries,
alcohol in moderation, stress management
and cannabinoids found in marijuana.
I'm just the messenger.
(Laughter)
What were we just talking about?
(Laughter)
And other things that can make it worse,
that can cause you to lose brain cells.
The usual suspects, like saturated fat and sugar,
nicotine, opiates, cocaine, too much alcohol and chronic stress.
so you age less quickly. Your skin doesn't wrinkle as much.
Your heart gets more blood flow.
We've shown that you can actually reverse heart disease.
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left,
after only a year become measurably less clogged.
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left,
the blue means no blood flow.
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow.
We've shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression
of early prostate cancer and, by extension, breast cancer,
simply by making these changes.
We've found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited
70 percent in the group that made these changes,
whereas only nine percent in the comparison group.
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow,
so you increase sexual potency.
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done
by the Department of Health Services,
showing that nicotine, which constricts your arteries,
can cause a heart attack or a stroke,
but it also causes impotence.
Half of guys who smoke are impotent.
How sexy is that?
the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer.
This is what's called a heat map --
and the different colors -- and along the side, on the right, are different genes.
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed --
in effect, turning on the good genes, the disease-preventing genes,
turning off the disease-promoting genes.
giving many people new hope and new choices.
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe,
that are giving you your genetic profiles,
are giving some people a sense of, "Gosh, well, what can I do about it?"
Well, our genes are not our fate, and if we make these changes --
they're a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes
than we might have made otherwise,
we can actually change how our genes are expressed.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I had a fire nine days ago.
My archive:
175 films, my 16-millimeter negative,
all my books, my dad's books, my photographs.
I'd collected --
I was a collector, major, big-time.
It's gone.
I just looked at it,
and I didn't know what to do.
I mean, this was --
was I my things?
I always live in the present -- I love the present.
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid,
like, you've got to make something good out of something bad.
You've got to make something good out of something bad.
This was bad! Man, I was --
I cough. I was sick.
That's my camera lens. The first one --
the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago.
That's my feature film. "King, Murray"
won Cannes Film Festival 1970 --
the only print I had.
That's my papers.
Epiphany hit me. Something hit me.
"You've got to make something good out of something bad,"
I started to say to my friends, neighbors, my sister.
By the way, that's "Sputnik." I ran it last year.
"Sputnik" was downtown, the negative. It wasn't touched.
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film,
which opens in New York in two weeks
downtown.
I called my sister. I called my neighbors. I said, "Come dig."
That's me at my desk.
That was a desk took 40-some years to build.
You know -- all the stuff.
That's my daughter, Jean.
She came. She's a nurse in San Francisco.
I want pieces. Bits and pieces."
I came up with this idea: a life of bits and pieces,
which I'm just starting to work on -- my next project.
That's my sister. She took care of pictures,
because I was a big collector of snapshot photography
that I believed said a lot.
And those are some of the pictures that --
something was good about the burnt pictures.
I didn't know. I looked at that --
I said, "Wow, is that better than the --"
That's my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle. I made that movie for television.
It's the only copy I had. Pieces of it.
Idea about women.
You could cry about this." I really didn't.
I just instead said,
"I'm going to make something out of it, and maybe next year ... "
And I appreciate this moment
to come up on this stage with so many people
who've already given me so much solace,
and just say to TEDsters:
I'm proud of me. That I take something bad,
I turn it, and I'm going to make something good out of this,
all these pieces.
That's Arthur Leipzig's original photograph I loved.
I was a big record collector --
the records didn't make it. Boy, I tell you,
film burns. Film burns.
I mean, this was 16-millimeter safety film.
The negatives are gone.
marry the woman I first married when I was 20.
That's my daughter and me.
She's still there. She's there this morning, actually.
That's my house.
My family's living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley.
That's my wife, Heidi,
who didn't take it as well as I did.
My children, Davey and Henry.
My son, Davey, in the hotel two nights ago.
from my three minutes, is that I appreciate the chance
to share this with you. I will be back. I love being at TED.
I came to live it, and I am living it.
That's my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz, in Bonny Doon,
just 35 miles from here.
Thank you everybody.
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union,
a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object
through a desolate countryside.
With it, they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere
by being the first to conquer outer space.
The rocket was huge.
And packed in its nose was a silver ball
with two radios inside.
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time:
"We are about to create a new planet
that we will call Sputnik.
In the olden days, explorers
like Vasco da Gama and Columbus
had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe.
Now we have the good fortune to open up space.
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy."
which is just about completed.
It tells the story of Sputnik,
and the story of what happened to America as a result.
For days after the launch,
Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity.
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens,
it inspired awe and pride
that humans had finally launched an object into space.
the media and the politicians told us,
and we believed, that Sputnik was proof
that our enemy had beaten us
in science and technology,
and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs,
using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile.
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America --
historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9/11.
It provoked the missile gap.
It exploded an arms race.
It began the space race.
Within a year, Congress funded huge weapons increases,
and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons
to 20,000.
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases.
this day, June 1958,
the National Civil Defense Drill,
where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground.
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans
believed that a nuclear war would happen,
and that at least 50 percent of our population
was going to be killed.
For example, some in this room went to school on scholarship
because of Sputnik.
Support for engineering, math and science --
education in general -- boomed.
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik
led directly to ARPA, and the Internet,
and, of course, NASA.
can be stampeded by those who know how to use media.
But it also shows how we can turn
what appears at first to be a bad situation,
into something that was overall very good for America.
"Sputnik" will soon be released.
one of my investors:
longtime TEDster, Jay Walker.
And I'd like to thank you all.
Let's just start by looking at some great photographs.
This is an icon of National Geographic,
an Afghan refugee taken by Steve McCurry.
But the Harvard Lampoon is about to come out
with a parody of National Geographic,
and I shudder to think what they're going to do to this photograph.
Oh, the wrath of Photoshop.
He mounted a camera on the tail.
A poetic image for a story on Tolstoy, by Sam Abell.
Pygmies in the DRC, by Randy Olson.
I love this photograph because it reminds me
of Degas' bronze sculptures of the little dancer.
A polar bear swimming in the Arctic, by Paul Nicklen.
Polar bears need ice to be able to move back and forth --
they're not very good swimmers --
and we know what's happening to the ice.
These are camels moving across the Rift Valley in Africa,
photographed by Chris Johns.
Shot straight down, so these are the shadows of the camels.
This is a rancher in Texas, by William Albert Allard,
a great portraitist.
And Jane Goodall, making her own special connection,
photographed by Nick Nichols.
This is a soap disco in Spain, photographed by David Alan Harvey.
And David said that there was lot of weird stuff
happening on the dance floor.
But, hey, at least it's hygienic.
(Laughter)
These are sea lions in Australia doing their own dance,
by David Doubilet.
And this is a comet, captured by Dr. Euan Mason.
And finally, the bow of the Titanic, without movie stars,
photographed by Emory Kristof.
Photography carries a power that holds up
under the relentless swirl of today's saturated, media world,
because photographs emulate the way
that our mind freezes a significant moment.
Four years ago, I was at the beach with my son,
and he was learning how to swim
in this relatively soft surf of the Delaware beaches.
But I turned away for a moment, and he got caught into a riptide
and started to be pulled out towards the jetty.
I can stand here right now and see,
as I go tearing into the water after him,
the moments slowing down and freezing into this arrangement.
I can see the rocks are over here.
There's a wave about to crash onto him.
I can see his hands reaching out,
and I can see his face in terror,
looking at me, saying, "Help me, Dad."
I got him. The wave broke over us.
We got back on shore; he was fine.
We were a little bit rattled.
But this flashbulb memory, as it's called,
is when all the elements came together to define
not just the event, but my emotional connection to it.
And this is what a photograph taps into
when it makes its own powerful connection to a viewer.
I was talking to Kyle last week about this,
that I was going to tell this story.
And he said, "Oh, yeah, I remember that too!
I remember my image of you
was that you were up on the shore yelling at me."
(Laughter)
I thought I was a hero.
(Laughter)
this represents -- this is a cross-sample of
some remarkable images taken by some of the world's greatest photojournalists,
working at the very top of their craft --
except one.
This photograph was taken by Dr. Euan Mason
in New Zealand last year,
and it was submitted and published in National Geographic.
Last year, we added a section to our website called "Your Shot,"
where anyone can submit photographs for possible publication.
And it has become a wild success,
tapping into the enthusiast photography community.
The quality of these amateur photographs
can, at times, be amazing.
And seeing this reinforces, for me,
that every one of us has at least one or two
great photographs in them.
you have to have more than just one or two
great photographs in you.
You've got to be able to make them all the time.
But even more importantly,
you need to know how to create a visual narrative.
You need to know how to tell a story.
So I'm going to share with you some coverages
that I feel demonstrate the storytelling power of photography.
a very small and relatively unknown wildlife sanctuary
in Chad, called Zakouma.
The original intent was to travel there
and bring back a classic story of diverse species,
of an exotic locale.
And that is what Nick did, up to a point.
This is a serval cat.
He's actually taking his own picture,
shot with what's called a camera trap.
There's an infrared beam that's going across,
and he has stepped into the beam and taken his photograph.
These are baboons at a watering hole.
Nick -- the camera, again, an automatic camera
took thousands of pictures of this.
And Nick ended up with a lot of pictures
of the rear ends of baboons.
(Laughter)
A lion having a late night snack --
notice he's got a broken tooth.
And a crocodile walks up a riverbank toward its den.
I love this little bit of water
that comes off the back of his tail.
It's one of the largest intact herds in this part of Africa.
Here's a photograph shot in moonlight,
something that digital photography has made a big difference for.
It was with the elephants that this story pivoted.
Nick, along with researcher Dr. Michael Fay,
collared the matriarch of the herd.
They named her Annie,
and they began tracking her movements.
The herd was safe within the confines of the park,
because of this dedicated group of park rangers.
But once the annual rains began,
the herd would begin migrating to feeding grounds outside the park.
For outside the safety of the park were poachers,
who would hunt them down only for the value of their ivory tusks.
The matriarch that they were radio tracking,
after weeks of moving back and forth, in and out of the park,
came to a halt outside the park.
Annie had been killed, along with 20 members of her herd.
And they only came for the ivory.
This is actually one of the rangers.
They were able to chase off one of the poachers and recover this ivory,
because they couldn't leave it there,
because it's still valuable.
But what Nick did was he brought back
a story that went beyond the old-school method
of just straight, "Isn't this an amazing world?"
And instead, created a story that touched our audiences deeply.
Instead of just knowledge of this park,
he created an understanding and an empathy
for the elephants, the rangers and the many issues
surrounding human-wildlife conflicts.
Sometimes you can tell a broad story in a focused way.
We were looking at the same issue that Richard Wurman
touches upon in his new world population project.
For the first time in history,
more people live in urban, rather than rural, environments.
And most of that growth is not in the cities,
but in the slums that surround them.
Jonas Bendiksen, a very energetic photographer,
came to me and said,
"We need to document this, and here's my proposal.
Let's go all over the world and photograph every single slum around the world."
And I said, "Well, you know, that might be a bit ambitious for our budget."
So instead, what we did was
we decided to, instead of going out and doing what would result
in what we'd consider sort of a survey story --
where you just go in and see just a little bit of everything --
we put Jonas into Dharavi,
which is part of Mumbai, India,
and let him stay there, and really get into
the heart and soul of this really major part of the city.
What Jonas did was not just go and do a surface look
at the awful conditions that exist in such places.
He saw that this was a living and breathing and vital part
of how the entire urban area functioned.
By staying tightly focused in one place,
Jonas tapped into the soul and the enduring human spirit
that underlies this community.
And he did it in a beautiful way.
We teamed up underwater photographer Brian Skerry
and photojournalist Randy Olson
to document the depletion of the world's fisheries.
We weren't the only ones to tackle this subject,
but the photographs that Brian and Randy created
are among the best to capture both the human
and natural devastation of overfishing.
Here, in a photo by Brian,
a seemingly crucified shark is caught up
in a gill net off of Baja.
I've seen sort of OK pictures of bycatch,
the animals accidentally scooped up
while fishing for a specific species.
But here, Brian captured a unique view
by positioning himself underneath the boat
when they threw the waste overboard.
And Brian then went on to even greater risk
to get this never-before-made photograph
of a trawl net scraping the ocean bottom.
a makeshift fish market in Africa,
where the remains of filleted fish were sold to the locals,
the main parts having already been sent to Europe.
And here in China, Randy shot a jellyfish market.
As prime food sources are depleted,
the harvest goes deeper into the oceans
and brings in more such sources of protein.
This is called fishing down the food chain.
and I think anytime we're doing a big, big story on this,
we don't really want to go
and just look at all the problems.
We also want to look for solutions.
Brian photographed a marine sanctuary in New Zealand,
where commercial fishing had been banned --
the result being that the overfished species have been restored,
and with them a possible solution for sustainable fisheries.
issues that are potentially distressing and controversial.
James Nachtwey, who was honored at last year's TED,
took a look at the sweep of the medical system
that is utilized to handle the American wounded coming out of Iraq.
It is like a tube where a wounded soldier enters on one end
and exits back home, on the other.
Jim started in the battlefield.
Here, a medical technician tends to a wounded soldier
on the helicopter ride back to the field hospital.
Here is in the field hospital.
The soldier on the right has the name of his daughter
tattooed across his chest, as a reminder of home.
From here, the more severely wounded are transported
back to Germany, where they meet up with their families
for the first time.
And then back to the States to recuperate at veterans' hospitals,
such as here in Walter Reed.
And finally, often fitted with high-tech prosthesis,
they exit the medical system and attempt
to regain their pre-war lives.
Jim took what could have been a straight-up medical science story
and gave it a human dimension that touched our readers deeply.
of how photography can be used
to address some of our most important topics.
But there are also times when photographers
simply encounter things that are, when it comes down to it,
just plain fun.
Photographer Paul Nicklin traveled to Antarctica
to shoot a story on leopard seals.
They have been rarely photographed, partly because they are considered
one of the most dangerous predators in the ocean.
In fact, a year earlier, a researcher had been
grabbed by one and pulled down to depth and killed.
So you can imagine Paul was maybe a little bit hesitant
about getting into the water.
Now, what leopard seals do mostly is, they eat penguins.
You know of "The March of the Penguins."
This is sort of the munch of the penguins.
(Laughter)
Here a penguin goes up to the edge and looks out
to see if the coast is clear.
And then everybody kind of runs out and goes out.
And he said he was never really afraid of this.
Well, this one female came up to him.
She's probably -- it's a shame you can't see it in the photograph,
but she's 12 feet long.
So, she is pretty significant in size.
And Paul said he was never really afraid,
because she was more curious about him than threatened.
This mouthing behavior, on the right,
was really her way of saying to him, "Hey, look how big I am!"
Or you know, "My, what big teeth you have."
(Laughter)
Then Paul thinks that she simply took pity on him.
To her, here was this big, goofy creature in the water
that for some reason didn't seem to be interested
in chasing penguins.
So what she did was she started to bring penguins to him,
alive, and put them in front of him.
She dropped them off, and then they would swim away.
She'd kind of look at him, like "What are you doing?"
Go back and get them, and then bring them back
and drop them in front of him.
And she did this over the course of a couple of days,
until the point where she got so frustrated with him
that she started putting them directly on top of his head.
(Laughter)
Which just resulted in a fantastic photograph.
(Laughter)
Eventually, though, Paul thinks that she just figured
that he was never going to survive.
This is her just puffing out, you know,
snorting out in disgust.
(Laughter)
And lost interest with him, and went back to what she does best.
mysterious and unknown creature,
and came back with not just a collection of photographs,
but an amazing experience and a great story.
It is these kinds of stories,
ones that go beyond the immediate or just the superficial
that demonstrate the power of photojournalism.
I believe that photography can make a real connection to people,
and can be employed as a positive agent
for understanding the challenges and opportunities
facing our world today.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm a medical illustrator,
and I come from a slightly different point of view.
I've been watching, since I grew up,
the expressions of truth and beauty in the arts
and truth and beauty in the sciences.
And while these are both wonderful things in their own right --
they both have very wonderful things going for them --
truth and beauty as ideals that can be looked at by the sciences
and by math are almost like the ideal conjoined twins
that a scientist would want to date.
(Laughter)
These are expressions of truth as awe-full things,
by meaning they are things you can worship.
They are ideals that are powerful. They are irreducible.
They are unique. They are useful --
sometimes, often a long time after the fact.
And you can actually roll some of the pictures now,
because I don't want to look at me on the screen.
that are often opaque to people who are not in the sciences.
They are things that describe beauty in a way
that is often only accessible if you understand the language
and the syntax of the person
who studies the subject in which truth and beauty is expressed.
If you look at the math, E=mc squared,
if you look at the cosmological constant,
where there's an anthropic ideal, where you see that life had to evolve
from the numbers that describe the universe --
these are things that are really difficult to understand.
since I had my training as a medical illustrator --
since I was taught animation by my father,
who was a sculptor and my visual mentor --
I wanted to figure out a way to help people
understand truth and beauty in the biological sciences
by using animation, by using pictures, by telling stories
so that the things that are not necessarily evident to people
can be brought forth, and can be taught, and can be understood.
where what they learn is subjects that have truth and beauty
embedded in them, but the way they're taught is compartmentalized
and it's drawn down to the point where the truth and beauty
are not always evident.
It's almost like that old recipe for chicken soup
where you boil the chicken until the flavor is just gone.
We don't want to do that to our students.
So we have an opportunity to really open up education.
in the Molecular and Cellular Biology Department,
a couple of years ago. He asked me if my team and I
would be interested and willing to really change
how medical and scientific education is done at Harvard.
So we embarked on a project that would explore the cell --
that would explore the truth and beauty inherent
in molecular and cellular biology
so that students could understand a larger picture
that they could hang all of these facts on.
They could have a mental image of the cell
as a large, bustling, hugely complicated city
that's occupied by micro-machines.
These micro-machines,
which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over,
are self-directed, powerful, precise, accurate devices
that are made out of strings of amino acids.
And these micro-machines power how a cell moves.
They power how a cell replicates. They power our hearts.
They power our minds.
how we could make this story into an animation
that would be the centerpiece of BioVisions at Harvard,
which is a website that Harvard has
for its molecular and cellular biology students
that will -- in addition to all the textual information,
in addition to all the didactic stuff --
put everything together visually, so that these students
would have an internalized view of what a cell really is
in all of its truth and beauty, and be able to study
with this view in mind, so that their imaginations would be sparked,
so that their passions would be sparked
and so that they would be able to go on
and use these visions in their head to make new discoveries
and to be able to find out, really, how life works.
We worked with a theme, which is, you've got macrophages
that are streaming down a capillary,
and they're touching the surface of the capillary wall,
and they're picking up information from cells
that are on the capillary wall, and they are given this information
that there's an inflammation somewhere outside,
where they can't see and sense.
But they get the information that causes them to stop,
causes them to internalize that they need to make
all of the various parts that will cause them to change their shape,
and try to get out of this capillary and find out what's going on.
with the Harvard scientists and databank models
of the atomically accurate molecules
and figure out how they moved, and figure out what they did.
And figure out how to do this in a way
that was truthful in that it imparted what was going on,
but not so truthful that the compact crowding in a cell
would prevent the vista from happening.
Reader's Digest version of the first aspect of this film
that we produced. It's an ongoing project
that's going to go another four or five years.
And I want you to look at this
and see the paths that the cell manufactures --
these little walking machines, they're called kinesins --
that take these huge loads
that would challenge an ant in relative size.
Run the movie, please.
are really quite amazing, and they really are the basis of all life
because all of these machines interact with each other.
They pass information to each other.
They cause different things to happen inside the cell.
And the cell will actually manufacture the parts that it needs
on the fly, from information
that's brought from the nucleus by molecules that read the genes.
No life, from the smallest life to everybody here,
would be possible without these little micro-machines.
In fact, it would really, in the absence of these machines,
have made the attendance here, Chris, really quite sparse.
(Laughter)
(Music)
This little guy is called the kinesin,
and he pulls a sack that's full of brand new manufactured proteins
to wherever it's needed in the cell --
whether it's to a membrane, whether it's to an organelle,
whether it's to build something or repair something.
And each of us has about 100,000 of these things
running around, right now,
inside each one of your 100 trillion cells.
So no matter how lazy you feel,
you're not really intrinsically doing nothing.
(Laughter)
is think about this, and think about how powerful our cells are.
And think about some of the things
that we're learning about cellular mechanics.
Once we figure out all that's going on --
and believe me, we know almost a percent of what's going on --
once we figure out what's going on,
we're really going to be able to have a lot of control
over what we do with our health,
with what we do with future generations,
and how long we're going to live.
And hopefully we'll be able to use this
to discover more truth, and more beauty.
(Music)
are aware enough of what the cell needs that they do their bidding.
They work together. They make the cell do what it needs to do.
And their working together helps our bodies --
huge entities that they will never see -- function properly.
Enjoy the rest of the show. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you so much everyone from TED, and Chris and Amy in particular.
I cannot believe I'm here.
I have not slept in weeks.
Neil and I were sitting there comparing how little we've slept
in anticipation for this. I've never been so nervous --
and I do this when I'm nervous, I just realized. (Laughter)
So, I'm going to talk about sort of what we did at this organization
called 826 Valencia, and then I'm going to talk
about how we all might join in and do similar things.
I was trying to finish my first book,
I was wandering around dazed every day
because I wrote from 12 a.m. to 5 a.m.
So I would walk around in a daze during the day.
I had no mental acuity to speak of during the day, but I had flexible hours.
In the Brooklyn neighborhood that I lived in, Park Slope,
there are a lot of writers --
it's like a very high per capita ratio
of writers to normal people.
Meanwhile, I had grown up around a lot of teachers.
My mom was a teacher, my sister became a teacher
and after college so many of my friends went into teaching.
And so I was always hearing them talk about their lives
and how inspiring they were,
and they were really sort of the most hard-working
and constantly inspiring people I knew.
so many of the struggles they were dealing with.
And one of them was that so many of my friends
that were teaching in city schools were having trouble
with their students keeping up at grade level,
in their reading and writing in particular.
Now, so many of these students had come from households
where English isn't spoken in the home,
where a lot of them have different special needs,
learning disabilities. And of course they're working in schools
which sometimes and very often are under-funded.
And so they would talk to me about this and say,
"You know, what we really need is just more people,
more bodies, more one-on-one attention,
more hours, more expertise from people
that have skills in English and can work with these students one-on-one."
And they would say, "Well, we have five classes of 30 to 40 students each.
This can lead up to 150, 180, 200 students a day.
How can we possibly give each student
even one hour a week of one-on-one attention?"
You'd have to greatly multiply the workweek and clone the teachers.
And so we started talking about this.
And at the same time,
I thought about this massive group of people I knew:
writers, editors, journalists, graduate students,
assistant professors, you name it.
All these people that had sort of flexible daily hours
and an interest in the English word --
I hope to have an interest in the English language,
but I'm not speaking it well right now. (Laughter)
I'm trying. That clock has got me.
But everyone that I knew had an interest in the primacy of the written word
in terms of nurturing a democracy, nurturing an enlightened life.
And so they had, you know, their time
and their interest, but at the same time
there wasn't a conduit that I knew of in my community
to bring these two communities together.
And the idea was to put McSweeney's --
McSweeney's Quarterly, that we published twice or three times a year,
and a few other magazines --
we were going to move it into an office for the first time.
It used to be in my kitchen in Brooklyn.
We were going to move it into an office,
and we were going to actually share space with a tutoring center.
So we thought, "We'll have all these writers and editors and everybody --
sort of a writing community -- coming into the office every day anyway,
why don't we just open up
the front of the building for students to come in there after school,
get extra help on their written homework,
so you have basically no border between these two communities?"
working on whatever we're working on,
at 2:30 p.m. the students flow in and you put down what you're doing,
or you trade, or you work a little bit later or whatever it is.
You give those hours in the afternoon
to the students in the neighborhood.
the landlord was all for it. We did this mural,
that's a Chris Ware mural, that basically explains the entire history
of the printed word, in mural form -- it takes a long time
So we rented this space.
And everything was great except the landlord said,
"Well, the space is zoned for retail; you have to come up with something.
You've gotta sell something.
You can't just have a tutoring center."
So we thought, "Ha ha! Really!"
And we couldn't think of anything necessarily to sell,
but we did all the necessary research.
It used to be a weight room, so there were rubber floors below,
acoustic tile ceilings and fluorescent lights.
whitewashed beams and it had the look --
while we were renovating this place, somebody said,
"You know, it really kind of looks like the hull of a ship."
And we looked around and somebody else said,
"Well, you should sell supplies to the working buccaneer." (Laughter)
and we said, "There's a point to that.
Let's sell pirate supplies." This is the pirate supply store.
You see, this is sort of a sketch I did on a napkin.
A great carpenter built all this stuff and you see,
we made it look sort of pirate supply-like.
We have the peg legs there, that are all handmade and fitted to you.
Up at the top, you see the eyepatch display,
which is the black column there for everyday use
special occasions, bar mitzvahs and whatever.
that we fill with treasures that students dig in.
This is replacement eyes in case you lose one.
These are some signs that we have all over the place:
While you're reading the sign, we pull a rope behind the counter
and eight mop heads drop on your head.
That was just my one thing -- I said we had to have something that drops on people's heads.
It became mop heads. And this is the fish theater,
which is just a saltwater tank with three seats,
and then right behind it we set up this space,
which was the tutoring center.
So right there is the tutoring center,
and then behind the curtain were the McSweeney's offices,
where all of us would be working on the magazine and book editing and things like that.
or we thought they would come in. I should back up.
We set the place up, we opened up, we spent months and months
renovating this place.
We had tables, chairs, computers, everything.
I went to a dot-com auction at a Holiday Inn in Palo Alto
and I bought 11 G4s with a stroke of a paddle.
Anyway, we bought 'em, we set everything up and then we waited.
It was started with about 12 of my friends,
people that I had known for years that were writers in the neighborhood.
And we sat. And at 2:30 p.m. we put a sandwich board out on the front sidewalk
and it just said, "Free Tutoring for Your English-Related
and Writing-Related Needs -- Just Come In, It's All Free."
And we thought, "Oh, they're going to storm the gates,
they're gonna love it." And they didn't.
And so we waited, we sat at the tables, we waited and waited.
And everybody was becoming very discouraged
that maybe there was a trust gap,
because we were operating behind a pirate supply store. (Laughter)
We never put it together, you know?
And so then, around that time, I persuaded a woman named Nineveh Caligari,
a longtime San Francisco educator --
she was teaching in Mexico City,
she had all the experience necessary,
knew everything about education,
was connected with all the teachers and community members in the neighborhood --
I convinced her to move up from Mexico City where she was teaching.
She took over as executive director.
Immediately, she made the inroads with the teachers
and the parents and the students and everything,
and so suddenly it was actually full every day.
was one-on-one attention.
The goal was to have a one-to-one ratio with every one of these students.
a student can get one grade level higher.
And so most of these students, English is not spoken in the home.
They come there, many times their parents --
you can't see it, but there's a church pew
that I bought in a Berkeley auction right there --
the parents will sometimes watch while their kids are being tutored.
So that was the basis of it,
was one-on-one attention.
And we found ourselves full every day with kids.
If you're on Valencia Street within those few blocks at around 2 p.m.,
2:30 p.m., you will get run over, often,
by the kids and their big backpacks, or whatever, actually running to this space,
But there was something psychological happening there
that was just a little bit different.
And the other thing was, there was no stigma.
Kids weren't going into the "Center-for-Kids-That-Need-More-Help,"
or something like that. It was 826 Valencia.
First of all, it was a pirate supply store, which is insane.
And then secondly, there's a publishing company in the back.
And so our interns were actually working
at the same tables very often,
and shoulder-to-shoulder, computer-next-to-computer with the students.
publishing center, is what we called it --
and a writing center.
actually working on a novel -- because we had very gifted kids, too.
So there's no stigma.
They're all working next to each other. It's all a creative endeavor.
They're seeing adults. They're modeling their behavior.
These adults, they're working in their field.
They can lean over, ask a question of one of these adults
and it all sort of feeds on each other.
There's a lot of cross-pollination. The only problem,
especially for the adults working at McSweeney's
who hadn't necessarily bought into all of this when they signed up,
was that there was just the one bathroom. (Laughter)
With like 60 kids a day, this is a problem.
in a given day, working one-on-one, getting all this attention --
they go home, they're finished. They don't stall.
They don't do their homework in front of the TV.
They're allowed to go home at 5:30 p.m., enjoy their family,
enjoy other hobbies, get outside, play.
And that makes a happy family.
A bunch of happy families in a neighborhood is a happy community.
A bunch of happy communities tied together is a happy city and a happy world.
There you have it, you know -- one-on-one attention.
and then we had about 50,
and then a couple hundred.
And we now have 1,400 volunteers on our roster.
And we make it incredibly easy to volunteer.
The key thing is, even if you only have a couple of hours a month,
those two hours shoulder-to-shoulder,
next to one student, concentrated attention,
shining this beam of light on their work,
on their thoughts and their self-expression,
is going to be absolutely transformative,
because so many of the students have not had that ever before.
So we said, "Even if you have two hours one Sunday every six months,
it doesn't matter. That's going to be enough."
So that's partly why the tutor corps grew so fast.
going to do with the space during the day,
because it has to be used before 2:30 p.m.?"
So we started bringing in classes during the day.
you can see it being typed up above.
This is one of the classes getting way too excited about writing.
You just point a camera at a class,
and it always looks like this.
So this is one of the books that they do.
Notice the title of the book,
And the first line of that book is, "Once there was a book named Cindy
that was about the Titanic."
So, meanwhile, there's an adult in the back typing this up,
taking it completely seriously, which blows their mind.
This is a shot of just some of the tutors during one of the events.
The teachers that we work with --
and everything is different to teachers -- they tell us what to do.
We went in there thinking,
"We're ultimately, completely malleable. You're going to tell us.
The neighborhood's going to tell us, the parents are going to tell us.
Because what about the students that wouldn't come to you,
necessarily, who don't have really active parents that are bringing them in,
or aren't close enough?" So then we started saying,
"Well, we've got 1,400 people on our tutor roster.
Let's just put out the word." A teacher will say,
"I need 12 tutors for the next five Sundays.
We're working on our college essays. Send them in."
So we put that out on the wire: 1,400 tutors.
Whoever can make it signs up. They go in about a half an hour before the class.
The teacher tells them what to do,
how to do it, what their training is, what their project is so far.
They work under the teacher's guide,
And that's actually the brunt of what we do is,
people going straight from their workplace, straight from home,
straight into the classroom and
working directly with the students.
So then we're able to work with thousands and thousands of more students.
Then another school said, "Well, what if we
just give you a classroom and you can staff it all day?"
where we decorated it in buccaneer style.
It's right off the library. And there we serve
all 529 kids in this middle school.
This is their newspaper, the "Straight-Up News,"
that has an ongoing column from Mayor Gavin Newsom
in both languages -- English and Spanish.
So then one day Isabel Allende wrote to us and said,
"Hey, why don't you assign a book with high school students?
I want them to write about how to achieve peace in a violent world."
And so we went into Thurgood Marshall High School,
which is a school that we had worked with on some other things,
and we gave that assignment to the students.
And we said, "Isabel Allende is going to read all your essays at the end.
She's going to publish them in a book.
She's going to sponsor the printing of this book in paperback form.
It's going to be available in all the bookstores in the Bay Area
and throughout the world, on Amazon and you name it."
So these kids worked harder
than they've ever worked on anything in their lives,
because there was that outside audience,
there was Isabel Allende on the other end.
I think we had about 170 tutors that worked on this book with them
and so this worked out incredibly well.
We had a big party at the end.
This is a book that you can find anywhere. So that led to a series of these.
You can see Amy Tan sponsored the next one,
"I Might Get Somewhere."
And this became an ongoing thing. More and more books.
The kids will work harder than they've ever worked in their life
if they know it's going to be permanent,
know it's going to be on a shelf,
with hundreds of hours of five drafts, six drafts --
all this attention that we give to their thoughts.
And once they achieve that level, once they've written at that level,
they can never go back.
It's absolutely transformative.
And so then they're all sold in the store. This is near the planks.
So we sell 'em, and then something weird had been happening
with the stores. The store, actually --
even though we started out as just a gag -- the store actually made money.
So it was paying the rent.
And maybe this is just a San Francisco thing --
I don't know, I don't want to judge.
But people would come in --
and this was before the pirate movies and everything!
It was making a lot of money. Not a lot of money,
but it was paying the rent, paying a full-time staff member there.
There's the ocean maps you can see on the left.
People would come in and say, "What the --?
What is this?" I don't want to swear on the web. (Laughter)
Is that a rule? I don't know.
They would say, "What is this?"
And people would come in and learn more about it.
And then right beyond -- there's usually a little chain there --
right beyond, they would see the kids being tutored.
and they might be more likely to buy some lard,
or millet for their parrot, or, you know, a hook,
or hook protector for nighttime, all of these things we sell.
teachers, donors, volunteers, everybody --
because it was street level. It was open to the public.
It wasn't a non-profit buried, you know, on the 30th floor
of some building downtown. It was right in the neighborhood
that it was serving, and it was open all the time to the public.
So, it became this sort of weird, happy accident.
"Well, why don't we have a place like that here?"
And a lot of them had been former educators
or would-be educators, so they combined
with a lot of local designers, local writers,
and they just took the idea independently
and they did their own thing.
They didn't want to sell pirate supplies.
They didn't think that that was going to work there.
So, knowing the crime-fighting community in New York,
they opened the Brooklyn Superhero Supply Company.
This is Sam Potts' great design that did this.
And this was to make it look sort of like one of those
keysmith's shops that has to have every service
they've ever offered, you know, all over there.
So they opened this place. Inside, it's like a Costco
for superheroes -- all the supplies in kind of basic form.
These are all handmade.
These are all sort of repurposed other products, or whatever.
All the packaging is done by Sam Potts.
where kids put their parents. You have the office.
This is a little vault -- you have to put your product in there,
it goes up an electric lift
and then the guy behind the counter tells you
that you have to recite the vow of heroism,
which you do, if you want to buy anything. And it limits, really, their sales.
Personally, I think it's a problem.
Because they have to do it hand on heart and everything.
These are some of the products. These are all handmade.
This is a secret identity kit.
If you want to take on the identity of Sharon Boone,
one American female marketing executive
from Hoboken, New Jersey. It's a full dossier
on everything you would need to know about Sharon Boone.
So, this is the capery where you get fitted for your cape,
and then you walk up these three steel-graded steps
and then we turn on three hydraulic fans
from every side and then you can see the cape in action.
There's nothing worse than, you know,
getting up there and the cape is bunching up or something like that.
So then, the secret door --
this is one of the shelves you don't see
when you walk in, but it slowly opens.
You can see it there in the middle next to all the grappling hooks.
It opens and then this is the tutoring center in the back. (Applause)
locally funded, locally built.
All the designers, all of the builders,
everybody was local, all the time was pro-bono.
I just came and visited and said, "Yes, you guys are doing great,"
or whatever. That was it. You can see the time
So this is the space during tutoring hours.
It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention,
complete devotion to the students' work
and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility
And this switch is flicked in their heads
when they walk through those 18 feet of this bizarre store, right?
So it's school, but it's not school.
It's clearly not school, even though
they're working shoulder-to-shoulder on tables, pencils and papers, whatever.
You can read this quote.
Addicted to video games and TV. Couldn't concentrate at home.
Came in. Got this concentrated attention.
And he couldn't escape it.
So, soon enough, he was writing. He would finish his homework early --
got really addicted to finishing his homework early.
and to have it checked, and to know he's going to achieve
the next thing and be prepared for school the next day.
So he got hooked on that, and then he started doing other things.
He's now been published in five books.
He co-wrote a mockumentary about failed superheroes
called "Super-Has-Beens."
He wrote a series on "Penguin Balboa,"
which is a fighting -- a boxing -- penguin.
And then he read aloud just a few weeks ago to 500 people at Symphony Space,
at a benefit for 826 New York. So he's there every day.
There's four family members that come in every day.
This is L.A., The Echo Park Time Travel Mart:
"Whenever You Are, We're Already Then." (Laughter)
This is sort of a 7-Eleven for time travelers.
So you see everything: it's exactly as a 7-Eleven would be.
Leeches. Mammoth chunks. They even have their own Slurpee machine:
These are spaces that are only affiliated with us,
doing this same thing: Word St. in Pittsfield, Massachusetts;
Ink Spot in Cincinnati; Youth Speaks, San Francisco, California,
which inspired us; Studio St. Louis in St. Louis;
Austin Bat Cave in Austin;
Fighting Words in Dublin, Ireland, started by Roddy Doyle,
this will be open in April.
I wish that you -- you personally and every creative individual
and organization you know -- will find a way
to directly engage with a public school in your area
and that you'll then tell the story of how you got involved,
so that within a year we have a thousand examples --
a thousand! -- of transformative partnerships.
Profound leaps forward!
And these can be things that maybe you're already doing.
I know that so many people in this room
are already doing really interesting things.
I know that for a fact. So, tell us these stories and inspire others on the website.
I'm going to switch to "we," and not "I," hope:
We hope that the attendees of this conference will usher in
a new era of participation in our public schools.
We hope that you will take the lead
in partnering your innovative spirit and expertise
with that of innovative educators in your community.
Always let the teachers lead the way.
They will tell you how to be useful. I hope that you'll step in and help out.
There are a million ways.
You can walk up to your local school
and consult with the teachers. They'll always tell you how to help.
So, this is with Hot Studio in San Francisco,
they did this phenomenal job.
This website is already up, it's already got a bunch of stories,
a lot of ideas. It's called "Once Upon a School,"
which is a great title, I think.
This site will document every story, every project that comes
out of this conference and around the world. So you go to the website,
you see a bunch of ideas you can be inspired by
and then you add your own projects once you get started.
Hot Studio did a great job in a very tight deadline. So, visit the site.
If you have any questions, you can ask this guy,
who's our director of national programs. He'll be on the phone.
You email him, he'll answer any question you possibly want.
And he'll get you inspired and get you going
and guide you through the process so that you can affect change.
You can do and use the skills that you have.
The schools need you. The teachers need you.
Students and parents need you. They need your actual person:
your physical personhood and your open minds
and open ears and boundless compassion,
sitting next to them, listening and nodding
and asking questions for hours at a time.
Some of these kids just don't plain know how good they are:
how smart and how much they have to say.
You can tell them. You can shine that light on them,
one human interaction at a time. So we hope you'll join us.
Thank you so much.
You know, I'm struck by how one of the implicit themes of TED
about compassion and bring it from the global level to the personal.
I'm a psychologist, but rest assured,
at Princeton Theological Seminary that speaks to why it is
we do sometimes, and we don't other times.
A group of divinity students at the Princeton Theological Seminary
were told that they were going to give a practice sermon
and they were each given a sermon topic.
Half of those students were given, as a topic,
the parable of the Good Samaritan:
to help the stranger in need by the side of the road.
Half were given random Bible topics.
Then one by one, they were told they had to go to another building
and give their sermon.
As they went from the first building to the second,
each of them passed a man who was bent over and moaning,
Did it matter they were contemplating the parable
of the Good Samaritan? Answer: No, not at all.
What turned out to determine whether someone would stop
and help a stranger in need
was how much of a hurry they thought they were in --
that we don't take every opportunity to help
because our focus is in the wrong direction.
This studies the circuitry in two people's brains
that activates while they interact.
And the new thinking about compassion from social neuroscience
is that our default wiring is to help.
we automatically empathize, we automatically feel with them.
we're automatically prepared to help. At least that's the argument.
that goes from complete self-absorption,
if we're preoccupied, as we so often are throughout the day,
we don't really fully notice the other.
and I had an epiphany, it was -- I came to my check
to the Seva Foundation and I noticed that I thought,
boy, my friend Larry Brilliant would really be happy
Then I realized that what I was getting from giving
was a narcissistic hit -- that I felt good about myself.
Then I started to think about the people in the Himalayas
that I went from this kind of narcissistic self-focus
for the people that were being helped. I think that's a motivator.
and focusing on others
is one that I encourage us all to pay attention to.
I was at a sushi restaurant a while back
and I overheard two women talking about the brother of one woman,
who was in the singles scene. And this woman says,
"My brother is having trouble getting dates,
the conversation ends and the woman can decide
whether to give her card or her email address to the man
for follow up. And this woman says,
"My brother's never gotten a card, and I know exactly why.
The moment he sits down, he starts talking non-stop about himself;
of The New York Times, looking at the back stories of marriages --
because they're very interesting -- and I came to the marriage
of Alice Charney Epstein. And she said
that when she was in the dating scene,
how long it would take the guy to ask her a question
with the word "you" in it.
And apparently Epstein aced the test, therefore the article.
The Harvard Business Review recently had an article called
"The Human Moment," about how to make real contact
with a person at work. And they said, well,
the fundamental thing you have to do is turn off your BlackBerry,
and pay full attention to the person.
There is a newly coined word in the English language
for the moment when the person we're with whips out their BlackBerry
or answers that cell phone, and all of a sudden we don't exist.
I have a brother-in-law who's an expert on horror and terror --
he wrote the Annotated Dracula, the Essential Frankenstein --
decided to write a book about a serial killer.
This is a man who terrorized the very vicinity we're in
his mother and five co-eds at UC Santa Cruz.
and he realizes when he meets him
For one thing, he's almost seven feet tall.
But that's not the most terrifying thing about him.
The scariest thing is that his IQ is 160: a certified genius.
But there is zero correlation between IQ and emotional empathy,
to ask the one question he really wants to know the answer to,
and that is: how could you have done it?
And the strangler says very matter-of-factly,
"Oh no. If I'd felt the distress, I could not have done it.
and in a sense, I've been reflecting on turning that part of us off.
we do turn that part of ourselves off if there's another person.
the objects that we buy and use have hidden consequences.
Or we don't know if that fabric is a technological
or manufacturing nutrient; it can be reused
or does it just end up at landfill? In other words,
we're oblivious to the ecological and public health
and social and economic justice consequences
of the things we buy and use.
In a sense, the room itself is the elephant in the room,
but we don't see it. And we've become victims
of a system that points us elsewhere. Consider this.
And it talks about the back story of something like a t-shirt.
And it talks about where the cotton was grown
and the fertilizers that were used and the consequences
for soil of that fertilizer. And it mentions, for instance,
that cotton is very resistant to textile dye;
about 60 percent washes off into wastewater.
And it's well known by epidemiologists that kids
who live near textile works tend to have high rates of leukemia.
There's a company, Bennett and Company, that supplies Polo.com,
Victoria's Secret -- they, because of their CEO, who's aware of this,
in China formed a joint venture with their dye works
to make sure that the wastewater
would be properly taken care of before it returned to the groundwater.
there's a new electronic tagging technology that allows any store
to know the entire history of any item on the shelves in that store.
back to the factory, you can look at the manufacturing processes
that were used to make it, and if it's virtuous,
you can label it that way. Or if it's not so virtuous,
you can go into -- today, go into any store,
put your scanner on a palm onto a barcode,
which will take you to a website.
ultimately everybody will know everything.
And the question is: will it make a difference?
Some time ago when I was working for The New York Times,
it was in the '80s, I did an article
on what was then a new problem in New York --
it was homeless people on the streets.
And I spent a couple of weeks going around with a social work agency
that ministered to the homeless. And I realized seeing the homeless
through their eyes that almost all of them were psychiatric patients
that had nowhere to go. They had a diagnosis. It made me --
what it did was to shake me out of the urban trance where,
when we see, when we're passing someone who's homeless
and thousands of people were streaming down the stairs.
And all of a sudden as I was going down the stairs
I noticed that there was a man slumped to the side,
shirtless, not moving, and people were just stepping over him --
And because my urban trance had been somehow weakened,
I found myself stopping to find out what was wrong.
And we found out that he was Hispanic, he didn't speak any English,
he had no money, he'd been wandering the streets for days, starving,
and he'd fainted from hunger.
My work is about the behaviors that we all engage in unconsciously,
on a collective level.
And what I mean by that, it's the behaviors
that we're in denial about,
and the ones that operate below the surface of our daily awareness.
And as individuals, we all do these things, all the time, everyday.
It's like when you're mean to your wife
because you're mad at somebody else.
Or when you drink a little too much at a party, just out of anxiety.
Or when you overeat because your feelings are hurt, or whatever.
And when we do these kind of things,
when 300 million people do unconscious behaviors,
then it can add up to a catastrophic consequence
that nobody wants, and no one intended.
And that's what I look at with my photographic work.
when you stand back at a distance,
it looks like some kind of neo-Gothic, cartoon image
of a factory spewing out pollution.
And as you get a little bit closer,
it starts looking like lots of pipes, like maybe a chemical plant,
or a refinery, or maybe a hellish freeway interchange.
And as you get all the way up close,
you realize that it's actually made of lots and lots of plastic cups.
And in fact, this is one million plastic cups,
which is the number of plastic cups that are used on airline flights
in the United States every six hours.
We use four million cups a day on airline flights,
and virtually none of them are reused or recycled.
They just don't do that in that industry.
by the number of paper cups we use every day,
and that is 40 million cups a day for hot beverages,
most of which is coffee.
I couldn't fit 40 million cups on a canvas,
but I was able to put 410,000. That's what 410,000 cups looks like.
That's 15 minutes of our cup consumption.
And if you could actually stack up that many cups in real life,
that's the size it would be.
And there's an hour's worth of our cups.
And there's a day's worth of our cups.
You can still see the little people way down there.
That's as high as a 42-story building,
and I put the Statue of Liberty in there as a scale reference.
that I find deeply troubling, and that is that America, right now,
has the largest percentage of its population in prison
of any country on Earth.
One out of four people, one out of four humans in prison
are Americans, imprisoned in our country.
And I wanted to show the number.
The number is 2.3 million Americans were incarcerated in 2005.
And that's gone up since then, but we don't have the numbers yet.
So, I wanted to show 2.3 million prison uniforms,
and in the actual print of this piece,
each uniform is the size of a nickel on its edge.
They're tiny. They're barely visible as a piece of material,
and to show 2.3 million of them required a canvas
that was larger than any printer in the world would print.
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels
that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide.
This is that piece installed in a gallery in New York --
those are my parents looking at the piece.
(Laughter)
Every time I look at this piece,
I always wonder if my mom's whispering to my dad,
"He finally folded his laundry."
(Laughter)
And this particular one is about cigarette addiction.
I wanted to make a piece that shows the actual number of Americans
who die from cigarette smoking.
More than 400,000 people die in the United States every year
from smoking cigarettes.
And so, this piece is made up of lots and lots of boxes of cigarettes.
And, as you slowly step back,
you see that it's a painting by Van Gogh, called "Skull with Cigarette."
It's a strange thing to think about, that on 9/11,
when that tragedy happened, 3,000 Americans died.
And do you remember the response?
It reverberated around the world,
and will continue to reverberate through time.
It will be something that we talk about in 100 years.
And yet on that same day, 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
And the day after that, another 1,100 Americans died from smoking.
And every single day since then, 1,100 Americans have died.
And today, 1,100 Americans are dying from cigarette smoking.
And we aren't talking about it -- we dismiss it.
The tobacco lobby, it's too strong.
We just dismiss it out of our consciousness.
And knowing what we know about the destructive power of cigarettes,
we continue to allow our children, our sons and daughters,
to be in the presence of the influences that start them smoking.
And this is what the next piece is about.
which is equal to the number of teenagers
who will start smoking this month, and every month in the U.S.
More than 700,000 children in the United States aged 18 and under
begin smoking every year.
that I want to acquaint you with
is this phenomenon of abuse and misuse of prescription drugs.
This is an image I've made out of lots and lots of Vicodin.
Well, actually, I only had one Vicodin
that I scanned lots and lots of times.
(Laughter)
And so, as you stand back, you see 213,000 Vicodin pills,
which is the number of hospital emergency room visits
yearly in the United States,
attributable to abuse and misuse of prescription painkillers
and anti-anxiety medications.
One-third of all drug overdoses in the U.S. --
and that includes cocaine, heroin, alcohol, everything --
one-third of drug overdoses are prescription medications.
A strange phenomenon.
about another tragic phenomenon. And that is the phenomenon,
this growing obsession we have with breast augmentation surgery.
384,000 women, American women, last year
went in for elective breast augmentation surgery.
It's rapidly becoming the most popular high school graduation gift,
given to young girls who are about to go off to college.
So, I made this image out of Barbie dolls,
and so, as you stand back you see this kind of floral pattern,
and as you get all the way back, you see 32,000 Barbie dolls,
which represents the number of breast augmentation surgeries
that are performed in the U.S. each month.
The vast majority of those are on women under the age of 21.
And strangely enough, the only plastic surgery
that is more popular than breast augmentation is liposuction,
and most of that is being done by men.
I'm not holding these out as being the biggest issues.
They're just examples.
And the reason that I do this, it's because I have this fear
that we aren't feeling enough as a culture right now.
There's this kind of anesthesia in America at the moment.
We've lost our sense of outrage, our anger and our grief
about what's going on in our culture right now,
what's going on in our country,
the atrocities that are being committed in our names around the world.
They've gone missing; these feelings have gone missing.
Our cultural joy, our national joy is nowhere to be seen.
And one of the causes of this, I think,
is that as each of us attempts to build this new kind of worldview,
this holoptical worldview, this holographic image
that we're all trying to create in our mind
of the interconnection of things: the environmental footprints
1,000 miles away of the things that we buy;
the social consequences 10,000 miles away
of the daily decisions that we make as consumers.
and try to educate ourselves about the enormity of our culture,
the information that we have to work with is these gigantic numbers:
numbers in the millions, in the hundreds of millions,
in the billions and now in the trillions.
Bush's new budget is in the trillions, and these are numbers
that our brain just doesn't have the ability to comprehend.
We can't make meaning out of these enormous statistics.
And so that's what I'm trying to do with my work,
is to take these numbers, these statistics
from the raw language of data, and to translate them
into a more universal visual language, that can be felt.
Because my belief is, if we can feel these issues,
if we can feel these things more deeply,
then they'll matter to us more than they do now.
And if we can find that,
then we'll be able to find, within each one of us,
what it is that we need to find to face the big question,
which is: how do we change?
That, to me, is the big question that we face as a people right now:
how do we change? How do we change as a culture,
and how do we each individually take responsibility
for the one piece of the solution that we are in charge of,
and that is our own behavior?
to look at these issues.
I'm not pointing the finger at America in a blaming way.
I'm simply saying, this is who we are right now.
And if there are things that we see
that we don't like about our culture,
then we have a choice.
The degree of integrity that each of us can bring to the surface,
to bring to this question, the depth of character that we can summon,
as we show up for the question of how do we change --
it's already defining us as individuals and as a nation,
and it will continue to do that, on into the future.
And it will profoundly affect the well-being, the quality of life
of the billions of people
who are going to inherit the results of our decisions.
I'm not speaking abstractly about this,
I'm speaking -- this is who we are in this room,
right now, in this moment.
(Applause)
My search is always to find ways to chronicle,
to share and to document stories about people, just everyday people.
Stories that offer transformation, that lean into transcendence,
but that are never sentimental,
that never look away from the darkest things about us.
Because I really believe that we're never more beautiful
than when we're most ugly.
Because that's really the moment we really know what we're made of.
As Chris said, I grew up in Nigeria
with a whole generation -- in the '80s --
of students who were protesting a military dictatorship, which has finally ended.
So it wasn't just me, there was a whole generation of us.
is that the world is never saved in grand messianic gestures,
but in the simple accumulation of gentle, soft, almost invisible acts of compassion,
everyday acts of compassion.
In South Africa, they have a phrase called Ubuntu.
Ubuntu comes out of a philosophy that says,
the only way for me to be human is for you to reflect
my humanity back at me.
But if you're like me, my humanity is more like a window.
I don't really see it, I don't pay attention to it
until there's, you know, like a bug that's dead on the window.
Then suddenly I see it, and usually, it's never good.
It's usually when I'm cussing in traffic
at someone who is trying to drive their car and drink coffee
and send emails and make notes.
So what Ubuntu really says
is that there is no way for us to be human without other people.
It's really very simple, but really very complicated.
I should tell you some stories about remarkable people,
so I thought I'd start with my mother.
(Laughter)
And she was dark, too.
My mother was English.
My parents met in Oxford in the '50s,
and my mother moved to Nigeria and lived there.
She was five foot two, very feisty and very English.
This is how English my mother is -- or was, she just passed.
She came out to California, to Los Angeles, to visit me,
and we went to Malibu, which she thought was very disappointing.
(Laughter)
And then we went to a fish restaurant,
and we had Chad, the surfer dude, serving us,
and he came up and my mother said,
"Do you have any specials, young man?"
And Chad says, "Sure, like, we have this, like, salmon,
that's, like, rolled in this, like, wasabi, like, crust.
It's totally rad."
And my mother turned to me and said,
"What language is he speaking?"
(Laughter)
I said, "English, mum."
And she shook her head and said,
"Oh, these Americans. We gave them a language,
why don't they use it?"
(Laughter)
to Catholicism when she married my father --
and there's no one more rabid than a Catholic convert --
decided to teach in the rural areas in Nigeria,
particularly among Igbo women,
the Billings ovulation method,
which was the only approved birth control by the Catholic Church.
But her Igbo wasn't too good.
So she took me along to translate.
I was seven.
(Laughter)
So, here are these women,
who never discuss their period with their husbands,
and here I am telling them, "Well, how often do you get your period?"
(Laughter)
And, "Do you notice any discharges?"
(Laughter)
And, "How swollen is your vulva?"
(Laughter)
She never would have thought of herself as a feminist,
my mother, but she always used to say,
"Anything a man can do, I can fix."
(Applause)
And when my father complained about this situation,
where she's taking a seven-year-old boy
to teach this birth control, you know,
he used to say, "Oh, you're turning him into --
you're teaching him how to be a woman."
My mother said, "Someone has to."
(Laughter)
we were caught in the war.
It was my mother with five little children.
It takes her one year, through refugee camp after refugee camp,
to make her way to an airstrip where we can fly out of the country.
At every single refugee camp, she has to face off soldiers
who want to take my elder brother Mark, who was nine,
and make him a boy soldier.
Can you imagine this five-foot-two woman,
standing up to men with guns who want to kill us?
All through that one year,
my mother never cried one time, not once.
But when we were in Lisbon, in the airport,
about to fly to England,
this woman saw my mother wearing this dress,
which had been washed so many times it was basically see through,
with five really hungry-looking kids,
came over and asked her what had happened.
And she told this woman.
And so this woman emptied out her suitcase
and gave all of her clothes to my mother, and to us,
and the toys of her kids, who didn't like that very much, but --
(Laughter) --
that was the only time she cried.
And I remember years later, I was writing about my mother,
and I asked her, "Why did you cry then?"
And she said, "You know, you can steel your heart
against any kind of trouble, any kind of horror.
But the simple act of kindness from a complete stranger
will unstitch you."
memorized the names of every dead person,
and they would sing these dirges, made up of these names.
Dirges so melancholic that they would scorch you.
And they would sing them only when they planted the rice,
as though they were seeding the hearts of the dead
into the rice.
But when it came for harvest time,
they would sing these joyful songs,
that were made up of the names of every child
who had been born that year.
And then the next planting season, when they sang the dirge,
they would remove as many names of the dead
that equaled as many people that were born.
And in this way, these women enacted a lot of transformation,
beautiful transformation.
the word for rape and the word for marriage
was the same one?
But today, women are rebuilding Rwanda.
Did you also know that after apartheid,
when the new government went into the parliament houses,
there were no female toilets in the building?
Which would seem to suggest that apartheid
was entirely the business of men.
All of this to say, that despite the horror, and despite the death,
women are never really counted.
Their humanity never seems to matter very much to us.
and I shouldn't say Nigeria, because that's too general,
but in Afikpo, the Igbo part of the country where I'm from --
there were always rites of passage for young men.
Men were taught to be men in the ways in which we are not women,
that's essentially what it is.
And a lot of rituals involved killing, killing little animals,
progressing along, so when I turned 13 --
and, I mean, it made sense, it was an agrarian community,
somebody had to kill the animals,
there was no Whole Foods you could go and get kangaroo steak at --
so when I turned 13, it was my turn now to kill a goat.
And I was this weird, sensitive kid, who couldn't really do it,
but I had to do it.
And I was supposed to do this alone.
But a friend of mine, called Emmanuel,
who was significantly older than me,
who'd been a boy soldier during the Biafran war,
decided to come with me.
Which sort of made me feel good,
because he'd seen a lot of things.
Now, when I was growing up, he used to tell me
stories about how he used to bayonet people,
and their intestines would fall out, but they would keep running.
So, this guy comes with me.
And I don't know if you've ever heard a goat, or seen one --
they sound like human beings,
that's why we call tragedies "a song of a goat."
My friend Brad Kessler says that we didn't become human
until we started keeping goats.
Anyway, a goat's eyes are like a child's eyes.
So when I tried to kill this goat and I couldn't,
Emmanuel bent down, he puts his hand over the mouth of the goat,
covers its eyes, so I don't have to look into them,
while I kill the goat.
It didn't seem like a lot, for this guy who'd seen so much,
and to whom the killing of a goat must have seemed
such a quotidian experience,
still found it in himself to try to protect me.
I was a wimp.
I cried for a very long time.
And afterwards, he didn't say a word.
He just sat there watching me cry for an hour.
And then afterwards he said to me,
"It will always be difficult, but if you cry like this every time,
you will die of heartbreak.
Just know that it is enough sometimes
to know that it is difficult."
Of course, talking about goats makes me think of sheep,
and not in good ways.
(Laughter)
So growing up, you know, I had a cake and everything,
but I never got any presents, because, born two days after Christmas.
So, I was about nine, and my uncle had just come back from Germany,
and we had the Catholic priest over,
my mother was entertaining him with tea.
And my uncle suddenly says, "Where are Chris' presents?"
And my mother said, "Don't talk about that in front of guests."
But he was desperate to show that he'd just come back,
so he summoned me up, and he said,
"Go into the bedroom, my bedroom.
Take anything you want out of the suitcase.
It's your birthday present."
I'm sure he thought I'd take a book or a shirt,
but I found an inflatable sheep.
(Laughter)
So, I blew it up and ran into the living room,
my finger where it shouldn't have been,
I was waving this buzzing sheep around,
and my mother looked like she was going to die of shock.
(Laughter)
And Father McGetrick was completely unflustered,
just stirred his tea and looked at my mother and said,
"It's all right Daphne, I'm Scottish."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
my cellmate -- for the last year, the first year of the last 18 months --
my cellmate was 14 years old.
The name was John James,
and in those days, if a family member committed a crime,
the military would hold you as ransom
till your family turned themselves in.
So, here was this 14-year-old kid on death row.
And not everybody on death row was a political prisoner.
There were some really bad people there.
And he had smuggled in two comics, two comic books --
"Spiderman" and "X-Men."
He was obsessed.
And when he got tired of reading them,
he started to teach the men in death row how to read,
with these comic books.
And so, I remember night after night,
you'd hear all these men, these really hardened criminals,
huddled around John James, reciting, "Take that, Spidey!"
(Laughter)
It's incredible.
I was really worried.
He didn't know what death row meant.
I'd been there twice,
and I was terribly afraid that I was going to die.
And he would always laugh, and say,
"Come on, man, we'll make it out."
Then I'd say, "How do you know?"
And he said, "Oh, I heard it on the grapevine."
They killed him.
They handcuffed him to a chair,
and they tacked his penis to a table with a six-inch nail,
then left him there to bleed to death.
That's how I ended up in solitary, because I let my feelings be known.
All around us, everywhere, there are people like this.
They would come together as a community,
and they would express a wish.
And their wish would then be brought to a priest,
who would find a ritual object,
and the appropriate sacrifices would be made,
and the shrine would be built for the god.
But if the god became unruly and began to ask for human sacrifice,
the Igbos would destroy the god.
They would knock down the shrine,
and they would stop saying the god's name.
This is how they came to reclaim their humanity.
Every day, all of us here,
we're building gods that have gone rampant,
and it's time we started knocking them down
and forgetting their names.
It doesn't require a tremendous thing.
All it requires is to recognize among us, every day --
the few of us that can see -- are surrounded by people
like the ones I've told you.
who offer all of us the mirror to our own humanity.
I want to end with a poem by an American poet called Lucille Clifton.
The poem is called "Libation," and it's for my friend Vusi
who is in the audience here somewhere.
"Libation,
North Carolina, 1999.
I offer to this ground, this gin.
I imagine an old man crying here,
out of the sight of the overseer.
He pushes his tongue through a hole
where his tooth would be, if he were whole.
It aches in that space where his tooth would be,
where his land would be,
his house, his wife, his son, his beautiful daughter.
He wipes sorrow from his face,
and puts his thirsty finger to his thirsty tongue,
and tastes the salt.
I call a name that could be his.
This is for you, old man.
This gin, this salty earth."
Thank you.
(Applause)
In the next 18 minutes, I'm going to take you on a journey.
And it's a journey that you and I have been on for many years now,
and it began some 50 years ago, when humans first stepped off our planet.
And in those 50 years, not only did we literally, physically set foot on the moon,
and we have landed on asteroids, we have rendezvoused with comets,
and, at this point in time, we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto,
the body formerly known as a planet.
and we, living on it, came to be.
and search for answers to questions like this,
there's Saturn. And we have been to Saturn before --
we visited Saturn in the early 1980s --
but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail
since the Cassini spacecraft, traveling across interplanetary space
for seven years, glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004,
and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost
that humanity had ever established around the Sun.
and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach.
In fact, just studying the rings alone, we stand to learn a lot
about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies.
And here's a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula,
which is our closest, largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way.
And then, here's a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy,
taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.
for a much larger human voyage
to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us,
and also how humans fit into that picture.
I can't show you all the beautiful pictures that we've taken
in the last two and a half years, because I simply don't have the time.
that we are conducting around Saturn,
and have been for the past two and a half years.
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we've taken of Saturn, in fact,
show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons. Here's Saturn with Dione,
and then, here's Saturn showing the rings edge-on,
showing you just how vertically thin they are, with the moon Enceladus.
Now, two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts.
and, until Cassini had arrived there,
was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain
that we had remaining in our solar system.
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who've watched the planets.
It has a very large, thick atmosphere,
and in fact, its surface environment was believed to be
more like the environment we have here on the Earth,
or at least had in the past, than any other body in the solar system.
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen, like you are breathing here in this room,
except that its atmosphere is suffused with
simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane.
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan
get broken down, and their products join together to make haze particles.
This haze is ubiquitous. It's completely global and enveloping Titan.
And that's why you cannot see down to the surface
with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum.
before we got there with Cassini, over billions and billions of years,
gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface
in a thick organic sludge.
But this is what we suspected. And these molecules,
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth.
It's a condensable in the atmosphere,
and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore
a whole world of bizarre possibilities. You can have methane clouds, OK,
and above those clouds, you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze,
which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface.
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth: it carves gullies; it forms rivers
and cataracts; it can create canyons; it can pool in large basins and craters.
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills,
down into the lowlands. So stop and think for a minute.
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like.
It's cold, it's eerie, it's misty,
it might be raining, and you might be standing
on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner. (Laughter)
is every bit as fascinating as that story is.
And for us, it has been like -- the Cassini people --
it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true.
As I said, it has a thick, extensive atmosphere.
And yet another moon there --
I don't even know which one it is. It's a very extensive atmosphere.
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface
through this atmosphere, and my camera system is one of them.
And we have taken pictures like this.
And what you see is bright and dark regions, and that's about as far as it got for us.
It was so mystifying: we couldn't make out what we were seeing on Titan.
like sinuous channels -- we didn't know. You see a few round things.
This, we later found out, is, in fact, a crater,
but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan,
meaning it's a very young surface.
And there are features that look tectonic.
They look like they've been pulled apart.
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet,
it means there's been a fracture, like a fault.
And so it's been tectonically altered.
until, six months after we got into orbit,
an event occurred that many have regarded
as the highlight of Cassini's investigation of Titan.
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe,
the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried
for seven years across the solar system. We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan,
it took two and a half hours to descend, and it landed on the surface.
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is.
This is a device of human making,
and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history.
It is so significant that, in my mind,
this was an event that should have been celebrated
with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe,
and sadly, that wasn't the case.
(Laughter).
and this event was celebrated in Europe, in Germany,
and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents,
and American accents, and German accents, and French and Italian and Dutch accents.
It was a moving demonstration of what the words
"united nations" are supposed to mean:
And, in this case, it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet,
and to come to understand a planetary system
that, for all of human history, had been unreachable,
and now humans had actually touched it.
So it was -- I mean, I'm getting goose bumps just talking about it.
It was a tremendously emotional event,
and it's something that I will personally never forget, and you shouldn't either.
(Applause).
and it also took panoramic pictures.
And I can't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures
of Titan's surface from the probe. And this is what we saw.
And it was a shocker, because it was everything we wanted
those other pictures taken from orbit to be.
It was an unambiguous pattern, a geological pattern.
It's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids.
And you can follow these channels
and you can see how they all converge.
And they converge into this channel here, which drains into this region.
You are looking at a shoreline.
Was this a shoreline of fluids? We didn't know.
But this is somewhat of a shoreline.
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers, OK? Again, the shoreline.
Okay, now, 16 kilometers, eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude.
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S.,
you would be flying at these altitudes.
So, this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines
as you fly across the surface of Titan. (Laughter)
and I'm going to show you, ladies and gentlemen,
the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system.
And here is the horizon, OK?
These are probably water ice pebbles, yes?
(Applause).
And obviously, it landed in one of these flat, dark regions
and it didn't sink out of sight. So it wasn't fluid that we landed in.
What the probe came down in was basically
the Titan equivalent of a mud flat.
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane.
And it's probably the case that this material
has washed off the highlands of Titan
through these channels that we saw,
and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins.
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in.
or even in the Huygens' images, of any large, open bodies of fluids.
Where were they? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes.
OK, so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan,
showing these dunes. These are dunes that are 100 meters tall,
separated by a few kilometers,
and they go on for miles and miles and miles.
There's hundreds, up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes.
This is the Saharan desert of Titan.
It's obviously a place which is very dry, or you wouldn't get dunes.
until finally, we saw lakes in the polar regions.
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan.
It's about the size of Lake Ontario.
And then, only a week and a half ago,
we flew over the north pole of Titan and found, again,
we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea.
So it seems that the liquids, for some reason we don't understand,
or during at least this season, are apparently at the poles of Titan.
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan
and having Earth-like geological formations
and a tremendous geographical diversity,
and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system
for complexity and richness is the Earth itself.
it's about a tenth the size of Titan. And you can see it here next to England,
just to show you the size. This is not meant to be a threat.
(Laughter).
And Enceladus is very white, it's very bright,
and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures.
It is a very geologically active body.
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus
was found at the south pole -- and we're looking at the south pole here --
where we found this system of fractures.
And they're a different color because they're a different composition.
They are coated. These fractures are coated with organic materials.
Moreover, this whole, entire region, the south polar region,
has elevated temperatures. It's the hottest place on the planet, on the body.
That's as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics.
that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine, icy particles
extending hundreds of miles into space.
And when we color-code this image, to bring out the faint light levels,
we see that these jets feed a plume
that, in fact, we see, in other images, goes thousands of miles
into the space above Enceladus.
My team and I have examined images like this,
and like this one, and have thought about the other results from Cassini.
And we have arrived at the conclusion
that these jets may be erupting from pockets
of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus.
In other words, we have possibly stumbled upon
the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration,
or in other words, an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms.
And I don't think I need to tell you that the discovery of life
elsewhere in our solar system,
whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere,
would have enormous cultural and scientific implications.
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred
not once, but twice, independently, in our solar system,
then that means, by inference, it has occurred a staggering number of times
throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history.
It is precious, it is unique,
it is still, so far, the only home we've ever known.
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s --
and we'd forgive you, if you weren't, OK --
you would remember this very famous picture
taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968.
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space,
and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe,
and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet.
a picture that no human eye has ever seen before.
It is a total eclipse of the Sun, seen from the other side of Saturn.
And in this impossibly beautiful picture,
you see the main rings backlit by the Sun,
you see the refracted image of the Sun
and you see this ring created, in fact,
by the exhalations of Enceladus.
sight of our own planet,
cradled in the arms of Saturn's rings.
about seeing ourselves from afar,
and capturing the sight of our little, blue-ocean planet
in the skies of other worlds.
And that, and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that,
may be, in the end, the finest reward that we earn
from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago.
And thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hello everyone.
And so the two of us are here to give you an example of creation.
And I'm going to be folding one of Robert Lang's models.
And this is the piece of paper it will be made from,
and you can see all of the folds that are needed for it.
And Rufus is going to be doing some improvisation
on his custom, five-string electric cello,
and it's very exciting to listen to him.
Are you ready to go? OK.
Just to make it a little bit more exciting.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I thought in getting up to my TED wish
I would try to begin by putting in perspective what I try to do
and how it fits with what they try to do.
We live in a world that everyone knows is interdependent,
but insufficient in three major ways.
It is, first of all, profoundly unequal:
half the world's people still living on less than two dollars a day;
a billion people with no access to clean water;
two and a half billion no access to sanitation;
a billion going to bed hungry every night;
one in four deaths every year from AIDS, TB, malaria
and the variety of infections associated with dirty water --
80 percent of them under five years of age.
In the United States, since 2001 we've had five years of economic growth,
five years of productivity growth in the workplace,
but median wages are stagnant and the percentage of working families
dropping below the poverty line is up by four percent.
The percentage of working families without health care up by four percent.
So this interdependent world which has been pretty good to most of us --
which is why we're all here in Northern California doing what we do
for a living, enjoying this evening -- is profoundly unequal.
It is also unstable.
Unstable because of the threats of terror,
weapons of mass destruction, the spread of global disease
and a sense that we are vulnerable to it in a way that we weren't not so many years ago.
And perhaps most important of all, it is unsustainable
because of climate change, resource depletion and species destruction.
and the grandchildren I hope to have,
it is a world that moves away from unequal, unstable, unsustainable
interdependence to integrated communities -- locally, nationally and globally --
that share the characteristics of all successful communities:
a broadly shared, accessible set of opportunities,
a shared sense of responsibility for the success of the common enterprise
and a genuine sense of belonging.
All easier said than done.
When the terrorist incidents occurred in the United Kingdom a couple of years ago,
I think even though they didn't claim as many lives as we lost in the United States on 9/11,
I think the thing that troubled the British most
was that the perpetrators were not invaders, but homegrown citizens
whose religious and political identities were more important to them
than the people they grew up with, went to school with,
worked with, shared weekends with, shared meals with.
In other words, they thought their differences
were more important than their common humanity.
It is the central psychological plague of humankind in the 21st century.
have more power to do good than at any time in history,
because more than half the world's people
live under governments they voted in and can vote out.
And even non-democratic governments are more sensitive to public opinion.
Because primarily of the power of the Internet,
people of modest means can band together and amass vast sums of money
that can change the world for some public good if they all agree.
When the tsunami hit South Asia, the United States contributed 1.2 billion dollars.
30 percent of our households gave.
Half of them gave over the Internet.
The median contribution was somewhere around 57 dollars.
And thirdly, because of the rise of non-governmental organizations.
They, businesses, other citizens' groups, have enormous power
to affect the lives of our fellow human beings.
When I became president in 1993,
there were none of these organizations in Russia.
There are now a couple of hundred thousand.
None in India. There are now at least a half a million active.
None in China. There are now 250,000 registered with the government,
probably twice again that many who are not registered for political reasons.
and the world that I hope to leave to the next generation,
and I tried to be realistic about what I had cared about all my life
that I could still have an impact on.
I wanted to focus on activities
that would help to alleviate poverty, fight disease, combat climate change,
bridge the religious, racial and other divides that torment the world,
but to do it in a way that would either use
whatever particular skills we could put together in our group
to change the way some public good function was performed
so that it would sweep across the world more.
And I want to say that the head of our AIDS effort,
and the person who also is primarily active in the wish I'll make tonight,
Ira Magaziner, is here with me and I want to thank him for everything he's done.
He's over there.
(Applause)
When I got out of office and was asked to work, first in the Caribbean,
to try to help deal with the AIDS crisis,
generic drugs were available for about 500 dollars a person a year.
If you bought them in vast bulks,
you could get them at a little under 400 dollars.
The first country we went to work in, the Bahamas,
was paying 3,500 dollars for these drugs.
The market was so terribly disorganized
that they were buying this medicine through two agents
who were gigging them sevenfold.
So the very first week we were working,
we got the price down to 500 dollars.
And all of a sudden, they could save seven times as many lives
for the same amount of money.
one of whom was cited in the film,
and negotiated a whole different change in business strategy,
because even at 500 dollars, these drugs
were being sold on a high-margin, low-volume, uncertain-payment basis.
So we worked on improving the productivity of the operations
and the supply chain, and went to a low-margin, high-volume,
absolutely certain-payment business.
I joked that the main contribution we made
to the battle against AIDS was to get the manufacturers
to change from a jewelry store to a grocery store strategy.
But the price went to 140 dollars from 500.
And pretty soon, the average price was 192 dollars.
Now we can get it for about 100 dollars.
Children's medicine was 600 dollars,
because nobody could afford to buy any of it.
We negotiated it down to 190.
Then, the French imposed their brilliantly conceived airline tax
to create a something called UNITAID,
got a bunch of other countries to help.
That children's medicine is now 60 dollars a person a year.
of everybody who needs the medicine to stay alive
are the absence of systems necessary to diagnose, treat and care
for people and deliver this medicine.
We started a childhood obesity initiative with the Heart Association in America.
We tried to do the same thing by negotiating industry-right deals
with the soft drink and the snack food industry to cut the caloric
and other dangerous content of food going to our children in the schools.
We just reorganized the markets.
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world,
somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets.
And that is now what we're trying to do,
and working with this large cities group to fight climate change,
to negotiate huge, big, volume deals that will enable cities
which generate 75 percent of the world's greenhouse gases,
to drastically and quickly reduce greenhouse gas emissions
in a way that is good economics.
And this whole discussion as if it's some sort of economic burden,
is a mystery to me.
I think it's a bird's nest on the ground.
for the "Inconvenient Truth" movie, I was thrilled,
but I had urged him to make a second movie quickly.
For those of you who saw "An Inconvenient Truth,"
the most important slide in the Gore lecture is the last one,
which shows here's where greenhouse gases are going
if we don't do anything, here's where they could go.
And then there are six different categories
of things we can do to change the trajectory.
We need a movie on those six categories.
And all of you need to have it embedded in your brains
and to organize yourselves around it.
So we're trying to do that.
Now we have taken on a second thing, and this gets to my wish.
It has been my experience in working in developing countries
that while the headlines may all be -- the pessimistic headlines may say,
well, we can't do this, that or the other thing because of corruption --
I think incapacity is a far bigger problem in poor countries than corruption,
and feeds corruption.
We now have the money, given these low prices, to distribute
AIDS drugs all over the world to people we cannot presently reach.
Today these low prices are available in the 25 countries where we work,
and in a total of 62 countries,
and about 550,000 people are getting the benefits of them.
But the money is there to reach others.
The systems are not there to reach the people.
working first in Rwanda and then in Malawi and other places --
but I want to talk about Rwanda tonight --
is to develop a model for rural health care in a very poor area
that can be used to deal with AIDS, TB, malaria, other infectious diseases,
maternal and child health, and a whole range of health issues
poor people are grappling with in the developing world,
that can first be scaled for the whole nation of Rwanda,
and then will be a model that could literally
be implemented in any other poor country in the world.
Will it provide high quality care?
And two, will it do it at a price
that will enable the country to sustain a health care system
without foreign donors after five to 10 years?
Because the longer I deal with these problems,
the more convinced I am that we have to --
whether it's economics, health, education, whatever --
we have to build systems.
And the absence of systems that function
break the connection which got you all in this seat tonight.
You think about whatever your life has been,
however many obstacles you have faced in your life,
at critical junctures you always knew
there was a predictable connection between the effort you exerted
and the result you achieved.
In a world with no systems, with chaos,
everything becomes a guerilla struggle,
and this predictability is not there.
And it becomes almost impossible to save lives,
educate kids, develop economies, whatever.
who has done the best job of this in the health care area,
of building a system in a very poor area, is Dr. Paul Farmer,
who, many of you know, has worked for now 20 years with his group,
Partners in Health, primarily in Haiti where he started,
but they've also worked in Russia, in Peru
and other places around the world.
As poor as Haiti is, in the area where Farmer's clinic is active --
and they serve a catchment area far greater
than the medical professionals they have would indicate they could serve --
since 1988, they have not lost one person to tuberculosis, not one.
And they've achieved a lot of other amazing health results.
So when we decided to work in Rwanda
on trying to dramatically increase the income of the country and fight the AIDS problem,
we wanted to build a healthcare network,
because it had been totally destroyed during the genocide in 1994,
and the per capita income was still under a dollar a day.
So I rang up, asked Paul Farmer if he would help.
Because it seemed to me if we could prove there was a model in Haiti
and a model in Rwanda that we could then take all over the country,
number one, it would be a wonderful thing for a country
that has suffered as much as any on Earth in the last 15 years,
and number two, we would have something that could then be adapted
to any other poor country anywhere in the world.
And so we have set about doing that.
And we're working in an area called Southern Kayonza,
which is one of the poorest areas in Rwanda,
with a group that originally includes about 400,000 people.
We're essentially implementing what Paul Farmer did in Haiti:
he develops and trains paid community health workers
who are able to identify health problems,
ensure that people who have AIDS or TB are properly diagnosed
and take their medicine regularly,
who work on bringing about health education, clean water and sanitation,
providing nutritional supplements and moving people up the chain of health care
if they have problems of the severity that require it.
The procedures that make this work have been perfected,
as I said, by Paul Farmer and his team
in their work in rural Haiti over the last 20 years.
Recently we did an evaluation of the first 18 months of our efforts in Rwanda.
And the results were so good that the Rwandan government
has now agreed to adopt the model for the entire country,
and has strongly supported and put the full resources of the government behind it.
We have about 500 people around the world
working in our AIDS program, some of them for nothing --
just for transportation, room and board.
And then we have others working in these other related programs.
Our business plan in Rwanda
was put together under the leadership of Diana Noble,
who is an unusually gifted woman,
but not unusual in the type of people who have been willing to do this kind of work.
She was the youngest partner at Schroder Ventures in London in her 20s.
She was CEO of a successful e-venture --
she started and built Reed Elsevier Ventures --
and at 45 she decided she wanted to do something different with her life.
So she now works full-time on this for very little pay.
She and her team of former business people have created a business plan
that will enable us to scale this health system up for the whole country.
And it would be worthy of the kind of private equity work
she used to do when she was making a lot more money for it.
had stunted growth due to malnutrition.
23 percent of them died before they reached the age of five.
Mortality at birth was over two-and-a-half percent.
Over 15 percent of the deaths among adults and children occurred
because of intestinal parasites and diarrhea from dirty water and inadequate sanitation --
all entirely preventable and treatable.
Over 13 percent of the deaths were from respiratory illnesses --
again, all preventable and treatable.
And not a single soul in this area was being treated for AIDS or tuberculosis.
we went from zero to about 2,000 people being treated for AIDS.
That's 80 percent of the people who need treatment in this area.
Listen to this: less than four-tenths of one percent of those being treated
stopped taking their medicine or otherwise defaulted on treatment.
That's lower than the figure in the United States.
Less than three-tenths of one percent
had to transfer to the more expensive second-line drugs.
400,000 pregnant women were brought into counseling
and will give birth for the first time within an organized healthcare system.
That's about 43 percent of all the pregnancies.
About 40 percent of all the people -- I said 400,000. I meant 40,000.
About 40 percent of all the people who need TB treatment are now getting it --
in just 18 months, up from zero when we started.
43 percent of the children in need of an infant feeding program
to prevent malnutrition and early death
are now getting the food supplements they need to stay alive and to grow.
Patients admitted to a hospital that was destroyed during the genocide
that we have renovated along with four other clinics,
complete with solar power generators, good lab technology.
We now are treating 325 people a month,
despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the AIDS patients are now treated at home.
And the most important thing is
because we've implemented Paul Farmer's model, using community health workers,
we estimate that this system could be put into place for all of Rwanda
for between five and six percent of GDP,
and that the government could sustain that
without depending on foreign aid after five or six years.
And for those of you who understand healthcare economics
you know that all wealthy countries spend between nine and 11 percent of GDP
on health care, except for the United States, we spend 16 --
but that's a story for another day.
(Laughter)
and our Foundation folks to scale this system up.
We're also beginning to do this in Malawi and Lesotho.
And we have similar projects in Tanzania, Mozambique,
Kenya and Ethiopia with other partners trying to achieve the same thing:
to save as many lives as quickly as we can,
but to do it in a systematic way that can be implemented nationwide
and then with a model that can be implemented in any country in the world.
We need initial upfront investment to train doctors, nurses,
health administration and community health workers throughout the country,
to set up the information technology, the solar energy,
the water and sanitation, the transportation infrastructure.
But over a five- to 10-year period,
we will take down the need for outside assistance
and eventually it will be phased out.
a high-quality rural health system in a poor country, Rwanda,
that can be a model for Africa,
and indeed, for any poor country anywhere in the world.
My belief is that this will help us to build a more integrated world
with more partners and fewer terrorists,
with more productive citizens and fewer haters,
a place we'd all want our kids and our grandchildren to grow up in.
It has been an honor for me, particularly, to work in Rwanda
where we also have a major economic development project
in partnership with Sir Tom Hunter, the Scottish philanthropist,
where last year we, using the same thing with AIDS drugs,
cut the cost of fertilizer and the interest rates on microcredit loans by 30 percent
and achieved three- to four-hundred percent increases
in crop yields with the farmers.
helped them when they were on the verge of destroying each other.
We're undoing that now, and they are so over it and so into their future.
We're doing this in an environmentally responsible way.
I'm doing my best to convince them not to run the electric grid
to the 35 percent of the people that have no access,
but to do it with clean energy. To have responsible reforestation projects,
the Rwandans, interestingly enough, have been quite good, Mr. Wilson,
in preserving their topsoil.
There's a couple of guys from southern farming families --
the first thing I did when I went out to this place
was to get down on my hands and knees and dig in the dirt
and see what they'd done with it.
that almost slaughtered itself out of existence
can practice reconciliation, reorganize itself, focus on tomorrow
and provide comprehensive, quality health care with minimal outside help.
I am grateful for this prize, and I will use it to that end.
We could use some more help to do this,
but think of what it would mean if we could have a world-class health system
in Rwanda -- in a country with a less-than-one-dollar-a-day-per-capita income,
one that could save hundreds of millions of lives
over the next decade if applied to every similarly situated country on Earth.
It's worth a try and I believe it would succeed.
Thank you and God bless you.

We can do that with our children, too.
That's a totally different world.
we're going back into the world.
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,
I said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together
"Jó napot, pacák" Which, as somebody here must surely know,
means "What's up, guys?" in Magyar,
that peculiar non-Indo-European language spoken by Hungarians
for which, given the fact that cognitive diversity is
at least as threatened as biodiversity on this planet,
few would have imagined much of a future even a century or two ago.
But there it is: "Jó napot, pacák"
I said somebody here must surely know, because
despite the fact that there aren't that many Hungarians to begin with,
and the further fact that, so far as I know, there's not a drop
of Hungarian blood in my veins, at every critical juncture of my life
there has been a Hungarian friend or mentor there beside me.
I even have dreams that take place in landscapes
I recognize as the landscapes of Hungarian films,
especially the early movies of Miklos Jancso.
Maybe it's because my native state of South Carolina,
which is not much smaller than present-day Hungary,
once imagined a future for itself as an independent country.
And as a consequence of that presumption,
my hometown was burned to the ground by an invading army,
an experience that has befallen many a Hungarian town and village
throughout its long and troubled history.
Or maybe it's because when I was a teenager back in the '50s,
my uncle Henry -- having denounced the Ku Klux Klan
and been bombed for his trouble and had crosses burned in his yard,
living under death threat -- took his wife and children to Massachusetts for safety
and went back to South Carolina to face down the Klan alone.
That was a very Hungarian thing to do,
as anyone will attest who remembers 1956.
And of course, from time to time Hungarians
have invented their own equivalent of the Klan.
is difficult to account for, but ultimately I ascribe it to an admiration
for people with a complex moral awareness,
with a heritage of guilt and defeat matched by defiance and bravado.
It's not a typical mindset for most Americans,
but it is perforce typical of virtually all Hungarians.
So, "Jó napot, pacák!"
at the tail end of the 1960s,
with the reckless condescension of that era
thinking I would save my people.
Never mind the fact that they were slow to acknowledge they needed saving.
I labored in that vineyard for a quarter century before
making my way to a little kingdom of the just in upstate South Carolina,
a Methodist-affiliated institution of higher learning called Wofford College.
I knew nothing about Wofford
and even less about Methodism,
but I was reassured on the first day that I taught at Wofford College
to find, among the auditors in my classroom,
a 90-year-old Hungarian, surrounded by a bevy of middle-aged European women
He was a puckish widower whose wife and children were dead
and whose grandchildren lived far away.
In appearance, he resembled Mahatma Gandhi,
minus the loincloth, plus orthopedic boots.
He had been born in 1903 in the provinces
of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire,
in what later would become Yugoslavia.
He was ostracized as a child, not because he was a Jew --
his parents weren't very religious anyhow --
but because he had been born with two club feet,
a condition which, in those days, required institutionalization
and a succession of painful operations between the ages of one and 11.
He went to the commercial business high school as a young man
in Budapest, and there he was as smart as he was modest
and he enjoyed a considerable success. And after graduation
when he went into textile engineering, the success continued.
He built one plant after another.
He married and had two sons. He had friends in high places who
assured him that he was of great value to the economy.
he was summoned in the middle of the night by the night watchman at one of his plants.
The night watchman had caught an employee who was stealing socks --
it was a hosiery mill, and he simply backed a truck up to the loading dock
and was shoveling in mountains of socks.
Mr. Teszler went down to the plant and confronted the thief and said,
"But why do you steal from me? If you need money you have only to ask."
The night watchman, seeing how things were going and waxing indignant,
said, "Well, we're going to call the police, aren't we?"
But Mr. Teszler answered, "No, that will not be necessary.
He will not steal from us again."
long after the Nazi Anschluss in Austria
and even after the arrests and deportations began in Budapest.
He took the simple precaution of having cyanide capsules placed in lockets
that could be worn about the necks of himself and his family.
And then one day, it happened: he and his family were arrested
and they were taken to a death house on the Danube.
In those early days of the Final Solution, it was handcrafted brutality;
people were beaten to death and their bodies tossed into the river.
But none who entered that death house had ever come out alive.
And in a twist you would not believe in a Steven Spielberg film --
the Gauleiter who was overseeing this brutal beating was the very same thief
who had stolen socks from Mr. Teszler's hosiery mill.
It was a brutal beating. And midway through that brutality,
one of Mr. Teszler's sons, Andrew, looked up and said,
"Is it time to take the capsule now, Papa?"
And the Gauleiter, who afterwards vanishes from this story,
leaned down and whispered into Mr. Teszler's ear,
"No, do not take the capsule. Help is on the way."
And then resumed the beating.
a car arrived from the Swiss Embassy.
They were spirited to safety. They were reclassified as Yugoslav citizens
and they managed to stay one step ahead of their pursuers
for the duration of the War, surviving burnings and bombings
and, at the end of the War, arrest by the Soviets.
Probably, Mr. Teszler had gotten some money into Swiss bank accounts
because he managed to take his family first to Great Britain,
then to Long Island and then to the center of the textile industry in the American South.
Which, as chance would have it, was Spartanburg, South Carolina,
the location of Wofford College.
And there, Mr. Teszler began all over again and once again achieved immense success,
especially after he invented the process
for manufacturing a new fabric called double-knit.
when the Klan was resurgent all over the South,
Mr. Teszler said, "I have heard this talk before."
And he called his top assistant to him and asked,
"Where would you say, in this region, racism is most virulent?"
"Well, I don't rightly know, Mr. Teszler. I reckon that would be Kings Mountain."
"Good. Buy us some land in Kings Mountain
and announce we are going to build a major plant there."
The man did as he was told, and shortly afterwards,
Mr. Teszler received a visit from the white mayor of Kings Mountain.
Now, you should know that at that time,
the textile industry in the South was notoriously segregated.
The white mayor visited Mr. Teszler and said,
"Mr. Teszler, I trust you’re going to be hiring a lot of white workers."
Mr. Teszler told him, "You bring me the best workers that you can find,
and if they are good enough, I will hire them."
He also received a visit from the leader of the black community,
a minister, who said, "Mr. Teszler, I sure hope you're going to
and if they are good enough, I will hire them."
As it happens, the black minister did his job better than the white mayor,
but that's neither here or there.
Mr. Teszler hired 16 men: eight white, eight black.
He had installed the heavy equipment for his new process
in an abandoned store in the vicinity of Kings Mountain,
and for two months these 16 men would live and work together,
mastering the new process.
He gathered them together after an initial tour of that facility
and he asked if there were any questions.
There was hemming and hawing and shuffling of feet,
and then one of the white workers stepped forward and said,
"Well, yeah. We’ve looked at this place and there's only one place to sleep,
there's only one place to eat, there's only one bathroom,
there's only one water fountain. Is this plant going to be integrated or what?"
Mr. Teszler said, "You are being paid twice the wages of any other textile workers in this region
and this is how we do business. Do you have any other questions?"
"No, I reckon I don't."
And two months later when the main plant opened
and hundreds of new workers, white and black,
poured in to see the facility for the first time,
They toured the facility and were asked if there were any questions, and
inevitably the same question arose:
"Is this plant integrated or what?"
And one of the white foremen stepped forward and said,
"You are being paid twice the wages of any other workers
in this industry in this region and this is how we do business.
Do you have any other questions?"
Mr. Teszler had integrated the textile industry in that part of the South.
It was an achievement worthy of Mahatma Gandhi,
conducted with the shrewdness of a lawyer and the idealism of a saint.
In his eighties, Mr. Teszler, having retired from the textile industry,
adopted Wofford College,
auditing courses every semester,
and because he had a tendency to kiss anything that moved,
becoming affectionately known as "Opi" -- which is Magyar for grandfather --
by all and sundry. Before I got there, the library of the college
had been named for Mr. Teszler, and after I arrived in 1993,
the faculty decided to honor itself by naming Mr. Teszler Professor of the College --
partly because at that point he had already taken
all of the courses in the catalog, but mainly because
he was so conspicuously wiser than any one of us.
To me, it was immensely reassuring that the presiding spirit
of this little Methodist college in upstate South Carolina
was a Holocaust survivor from Central Europe.
Wise he was, indeed, but he also had a wonderful sense of humor.
And once for an interdisciplinary class,
I was screening the opening segment of Ingmar Bergman's "The Seventh Seal."
As the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase
of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden,
only to find the specter of death waiting for him,
Mr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students. And
as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight
in a ghastly embrace, I heard Mr. Teszler's tremulous voice:
"Uh oh," he said, "This doesn't look so good." (Laughter)
And on the first occasion that I visited his house, he gave me
honor of deciding what piece of music we would listen to.
And I delighted him by rejecting "Cavalleria Rusticana"
in favor of Bela Bartok's "Bluebeard's Castle."
I love Bartok's music, as did Mr. Teszler,
and he had virtually every recording of Bartok's music ever issued.
Mr. Teszler that it had been composed in nearby Asheville, North Carolina
in the last year of the composer's life.
He was dying of leukemia and he knew it,
and he dedicated this concerto to his wife,
Dita, who was herself a concert pianist.
And into the slow, second movement, marked "adagio religioso,"
he incorporated the sounds of birdsong that he heard
outside his window in what he knew would be his last spring;
he was imagining a future for her in which he would play no part.
And clearly this composition is his final statement to her --
it was first performed after his death --
and through her to the world.
And just as clearly, it is saying, "It's okay. It was all so beautiful.
Whenever you hear this, I will be there."
that the marker on the grave of Bela Bartok in Hartsdale, New York
was paid for by Sandor Teszler. "Jó napot, Bela!"
Not long before Mr. Teszler’s own death at the age of 97,
he heard me hold forth on human iniquity.
I delivered a lecture in which I described history
as, on the whole, a tidal wave of human suffering and brutality,
and Mr. Teszler came up to me afterwards with gentle reproach and said,
"You know, Doctor, human beings are fundamentally good."
And I made a vow to myself, then and there,
that if this man who had such cause to think otherwise
had reached that conclusion,
I would not presume to differ until he released me from my vow.
And now he's dead, so I'm stuck with my vow.
"Jó napot, Sandor!"
but almost immediately I met Francis Robicsek, a Hungarian doctor --
actually a heart surgeon in Charlotte, North Carolina, then in his late seventies --
who had been a pioneer in open-heart surgery,
and, tinkering away in his garage behind his house,
had invented many of the devices that are standard parts of those procedures.
He's also a prodigious art collector, beginning as an intern in Budapest
by collecting 16th- and 17th-century Dutch art and Hungarian painting,
and when he came to this country moving on to Spanish colonial art,
Russian icons and finally Mayan ceramics.
He's the author of seven books, six of them on Mayan ceramics.
It was he who broke the Mayan codex, enabling scholars to relate
the pictographs on Mayan ceramics to the hieroglyphs of the Mayan script.
and we saw hundreds of works of museum quality,
and then we paused in front of a closed door and Dr. Robicsek said,
with obvious pride, "Now for the piece De resistance."
And he opened the door and we walked into a
windowless 20-by-20-foot room with shelves from floor to ceiling, and
crammed on every shelf his collection of Mayan ceramics.
Now, I know absolutely nothing about Mayan ceramics,
but I wanted to be as ingratiating as possible so I said,
"But Dr. Robicsek, this is absolutely dazzling."
"Yes," he said. "That is what the Louvre said.
They would not leave me alone until I let them have a piece,
but it was not a good one." (Laughter)
to lecture at Wofford College on -- what else?
-- Leonardo da Vinci. And further, I should invite him to meet
my oldest trustee, who had majored in French history at Yale
some 70-odd years before and, at 89, still ruled the world's
largest privately owned textile empire with an iron hand.
His name is Roger Milliken. And Mr. Milliken agreed,
and Dr. Robicsek agreed. And Dr. Robicsek visited
and delivered the lecture and it was a dazzling success.
And afterwards we convened at the President's House with Dr. Robicsek
on one hand, Mr. Milliken on the other.
And it was only at that moment, as we were sitting down to dinner,
together -- it was like introducing Mothra to Godzilla over the skyline of Tokyo.
If they didn't like each other, we could all get trampled to death.
They got along famously until the very end of the meal,
and then they got into a furious argument.
And what they were arguing about was this:
whether the second Harry Potter movie was as good as the first. (Laughter)
Mr. Milliken said it was not. Dr. Robicsek disagreed.
I was still trying to take in the notion that these titans,
"You just think it's so good because you didn't read the book."
And Dr. Robicsek reeled back in his chair, but quickly gathered his wits,
leaned forward and said, "Well, that is true, but I'll bet you went
to the movie with a grandchild." "Well, yes, I did," conceded Mr. Milliken.
"Aha!" said Dr. Robicsek. "I went to the movie all by myself." (Laughter) (Applause)
that what these two men were revealing was the secret
of their extraordinary success, each in his own right.
And it lay precisely in that insatiable curiosity,
that irrepressible desire to know, no matter what the subject,
no matter what the cost,
even at a time when the keepers of the Doomsday Clock
are willing to bet even money that the human race won't be around
to imagine anything in the year 2100, a scant 93 years from now.
"Live each day as if it is your last," said Mahatma Gandhi.
"Learn as if you'll live forever."
This is what I'm passionate about. It is precisely this.
It is this inextinguishable, undaunted appetite for learning and experience,
no matter how risible, no matter how esoteric,
no matter how seditious it might seem.
This defines the imagined futures of our fellow Hungarians --
Robicsek, Teszler and Bartok -- as it does my own.
As it does, I suspect, that of everybody here.
This is our task; we know it will be hard.
"Ez a mi munkank; es nem is keves. Jó napot, pacák!" (Applause)
So, I kind of believe that we're in like the "cave-painting" era of computer interfaces.
Like, they're very kind of -- they don't go as deep or as emotionally engaging as they possibly could be
and I'd like to change all that.
Hit me.
OK. So I mean, this is the kind of status quo interface, right?
It's very flat, kind of rigid.
And OK, so you could sex it up and like go to a much more lickable Mac,
you know, but really it's the kind of same old crap we've had for the last,
you know, 30 years.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Like I think we really put up with a lot of crap with our computers.
I mean it's point and click, it's like the menus, icons, it's all the kind of same thing.
It's so much more subtle, so much more visceral
-- you know, what's visible, what's not.
And I'd like to bring that experience to the desktop.
So I kind of have a -- this is BumpTop.
It's kind of like a new approach to desktop computing.
So you can bump things -- they're all physically, you know, manipulable and stuff.
And instead of that point and click, it's like a push and pull,
things collide as you'd expect them. Just like on my real desk,
I can -- let me just grab these guys -- I can turn things into piles
instead of just the folders that we have.
And once things are in a pile I can browse them by throwing them into a grid,
or you know, flip through them like a book
or I can lay them out like a deck of cards.
When they're laid out, I can pull things to new locations or delete things
or just quickly sort a whole pile, you know, just immediately, right?
And then, it's all smoothly animated, instead of these jarring changes you see in today's interfaces.
I just toss it to the pile, and it's added right to the top. It's a kind of nice way.
Also some of the stuff we can do is,
for these individual icons we thought -- I mean,
how can we play with the idea of an icon, and push that further?
And one of the things I can do is make it bigger
if I want to emphasize it and make it more important.
it's actually heavier. So the lighter stuff doesn't really move
but if I throw it at the lighter guys, right?
(Laughter)
So it's cute, but it's also like a subtle channel of conveying information, right?
This is heavy so it feels more important. So it's kind of cool.
because it has a lot of, I think, valuable properties.
And some of those we wanted to transfer to the icons in our system.
So one of the things you can do to our icons, just like paper, is crease them and fold them,
just like paper. Remember, you know, something for later.
Or if you want to be destructive, you can just crumple it up
and, you know, toss it to the corner.
Also just like paper, around our workspace
we'll pin things up to the wall to remember them later,
and I can do the same thing here,
and you know, you'll see post-it notes and things like that around people's offices.
And I can pull them off when I want to work with them.
you know, "Okay, well my real desk is really messy. I don't want that mess on my computer."
So one thing we have for that is like a grid align,
kind of -- so you get that more traditional desktop. Things are kind of grid aligned.
More boring, but you still have that kind of colliding and bumping.
And you can still do fun things like make shelves on your desktop.
I think beyond the icons, I think another really cool domain for this software --
I think it applies to more than just icons and your desktop -- but browsing photographs.
I think you can really enrich the way we browse our photographs
and bring it to that kind of shoebox of, you know, photos with your family on the kitchen table kind of thing.
I can toss these things around. They're so much more tangible and touchable --
and you know I can double-click on something to take a look at it.
And I can do all that kind of same stuff I showed you before.
So I can pile things up, I can flip through it, I can, you know --
okay, let's move this photo to the back, let's delete this guy here,
and I think it's just a much more rich kind of way of interacting with your information.
The Value of Nothing: Out of Nothing Comes Something.
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old
and I got a B+. (Laughter)
What I'm going to talk about: nothing out of something, and how we create.
And I'm gonna try and do that within
the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within,
and to follow the TED commandments:
that is, actually, something that creates
a near-death experience,
but near-death is good for creativity.
(Laughter) OK.
because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me
if I said anything that was a lie, or not true to universal creativity.
And I've done it this way for half the audience, who is scientific.
When I say we, I don't mean you, necessarily;
I mean me, and my right brain, my left brain
and the one that's in between that is the censor
and tells me what I'm saying is wrong.
And I'm going do that also by looking at
what I think is part of my creative process,
which includes a number of things that happened, actually --
the nothing started even earlier than the moment
in which I'm creating something new.
And that includes nature, and nurture,
and what I refer to as nightmares.
we are innately equipped with something, perhaps
in our brains, some abnormal chromosome
that causes this muse-like effect.
And some people would say that we're born with it in some other means.
And others, like my mother,
would say that I get my material from past lives.
Some people would also say that creativity
may be a function of some other neurological quirk --
van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of, you know, psychosis, or depression.
I do have to say, somebody -- I read recently
that van Gogh wasn't really necessarily psychotic,
that he might have had temporal lobe seizures,
and that might have caused his spurt of creativity, and I don't --
I suppose it does something in some part of your brain.
And I will mention that I actually developed
temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago,
but it was during the time I was writing my last book,
and some people say that book is quite different.
you know, who am I, why am I this particular person,
why am I not black like everybody else?
And sometimes you're equipped with skills,
but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity.
I used to draw. I thought I would be an artist.
And I had a miniature poodle.
And it wasn't bad, but it wasn't really creative.
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way.
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book.
And then, I also wasn't really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be,
and you know, you look at those scores, and it wasn't bad,
but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make
my living out of the artful arrangement of words.
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had,
and that is that, you know, I had expectations placed on me.
That figure right there, by the way,
figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old,
and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age.
I have some ones that were long lasting: from the age of five to 15,
this was supposed to be my side occupation,
and it led to a sense of failure.
that happened when I was about 14.
And it was discovered that my brother, in 1967, and then my father,
six months later, had brain tumors.
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong,
and she was gonna find out what it was, and she was gonna fix it.
My father was a Baptist minister, and he believed in miracles,
and that God's will would take care of that.
But, of course, they ended up dying, six months apart.
And after that, my mother believed that it was fate, or curses
-- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe
why this would have happened.
Everything except randomness. She did not believe in randomness.
There was a reason for everything.
And one of the reasons, she thought, was that her mother,
who had died when she was very young, was angry at her.
And so, I had this notion of death all around me,
because my mother also believed that I would be next, and she would be next.
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon,
you begin to think very much about everything.
You become very creative, in a survival sense.
And they're the same ones that I have today.
And they are: why do things happen, and how do things happen?
And the one my mother asked: how do I make things happen?
It's a wonderful way to look at these questions, when you write a story.
Because, after all, in that framework, between page one and 300,
you have to answer this question of why things happen, how things happen,
in what order they happen. What are the influences?
How do I, as the narrator, as the writer, also influence that?
And it's also one that, I think, many of our scientists have been asking.
It's a kind of cosmology, and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe,
as the creator of that universe.
in trying to make that happen, trying to figure it out
-- years and years, oftentimes.
So, when I look at creativity, I also think that it is this sense or this inability
to repress, my looking at associations in practically anything in life.
And I got a lot of them during what's been going on
throughout this conference,
almost everything that's been going on.
quantum mechanics, which I really don't understand,
but I'm still gonna use it as the process
for explaining how it is the metaphor.
So, in quantum mechanics, of course, you have dark energy and dark matter.
And it's the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen.
There's a lot of unknown, and you often don't know what it is except by its absence.
But when you make those associations,
you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story,
and what you're finding is what matters. The meaning.
And that's what I look for in my work, a personal meaning.
as I understand it. (Laughter)
And this happens constantly in the writing.
And there's the terrible and dreaded observer effect,
in which you're looking for something, and
you know, things are happening simultaneously,
and you're looking at it in a different way,
and you're trying to really look for the about-ness,
or what is this story about. And if you try too hard,
then you will only write the about.
You won't discover anything.
And what you were supposed to find,
what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way,
is no longer there.
Now, I don't want to ignore
the other side of what happens in our universe,
like many of our scientists have.
And so, I am going to just throw in string theory here,
and just say that creative people are multidimensional,
and there are 11 levels, I think, of anxiety.
(Laughter) And they all operate at the same time.
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant.
And you don't know what is operating, but something is operating there.
And ambiguity, to me, is very uncomfortable
in my life, and I have it. Moral ambiguity.
It is constantly there. And, just as an example,
this is one that recently came to me.
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman
who was talking about the war in Iraq. And she said,
"Save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
A very famous Chinese saying, she said.
And that means because we went into Iraq, we should stay there
until things were solved. You know, maybe even 100 years.
So, there was another one that I came across,
and it's "saving fish from drowning."
And it's what Buddhist fishermen say,
because they're not supposed to kill anything.
And they also have to make a living, and people need to be fed.
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning,
and unfortunately, in the process the fish die.
-- actually, one of them is my mother's interpretation,
and it is a famous Chinese saying, because she said it to me:
"save a man from drowning, you are responsible to him for life."
And it was a warning -- don't get involved in other people's business,
or you're going to get stuck.
OK. I think if somebody really was drowning, she'd save them.
But, both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning,
or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions.
And then we have intentions.
There's an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do,
and then we do something.
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been.
Maybe things go wrong. And so, after that, what are our responsibilities?
What are we supposed to do?
Do we stay in for life,
or do we do something else and justify and say, well, my intentions were good,
and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it?
That is the ambiguity in my life
that really disturbed me, and led me to write a book called
"Saving Fish From Drowning."
I got these hints everywhere.
And then, in a way, I knew that they had always been there.
And then writing, that's what happens. I get these hints, these clues,
and I realize that they've been obvious, and yet they have not been.
And what I need, in effect, is a focus.
And when I have the question, it is a focus.
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through
that question, and what happens is those particular things become relevant.
And it seems like it's happening all the time.
You think there's a sort of coincidence going on, a serendipity,
in which you're getting all this help from the universe.
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus.
And you are noticing it more often.
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions.
Your brother, who's fallen in trouble, do you take care of him?
Why or why not?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious
-- as I said, human rights in Burma.
I was thinking that I shouldn't go because somebody said, if I did, it would show
that I approved of the military regime there.
And then, after a while, I had to ask myself,
"Why do we take on knowledge, why do we take on assumptions
that other people have given us?"
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up,
and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father,
who was a Baptist minister.
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions,
and still didn't know that if I went there,
what the result of that would be, if I wrote a book --
and I just would have to face that later, when the time came.
We come to this point and say, what do I as an individual do?
Not all of us can go to Africa, or work at hospitals,
so what do we do, if we have this moral response, this feeling?
Also, I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at,
and we talked about today, is genocide.
This leads to this question.
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable,
and I consider what my intentions should be,
I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child
-- and why am I here, and what is the meaning of my life,
and what is my place in the universe?
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense,
and yet it is also absolutely necessary.
In writing a story, it is the place where I begin.
Sometimes I get help from the universe, it seems.
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book,
because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know.
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally,
from an overdose of opium, while having too much of a good time,
I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself,
and that actually was the way it happened.
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother.
which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book.
In this case, I was writing a story
that included some kind of detail, period of history, a certain location.
And I needed to find something historically that would match that.
And I took down this book, and I --
first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting, and the time period,
and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion,
happening in the area near Guilin, outside of that,
and a character who thought he was the son of God.
Well, what is random? What is chance? What is luck?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can't really explain?
And that goes into the story, too.
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day.
Especially when good things happen,
and, in particular, when bad things happen.
But I do think there's a kind of serendipity,
and I do want to know what those elements are,
so I can thank them, and also try to find them in my life.
Because, again, I think that when I am aware of them, more of them happen.
-- I just was with some friends, and we drove randomly to a different place,
and we ended up in this non-tourist location,
a beautiful village, pristine.
And we walked three valleys beyond,
and the third valley, there was something quite mysterious and ominous,
a discomfort I felt. And then I knew that had to be [the] setting of my book.
And in writing one of the scenes, it happened in that third valley.
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building.
And I didn't know exactly why I had it, but it was so vivid.
I got stuck, and a friend, when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs,
that I said, sure. And about 45 minutes later,
walking along the beach, I came across this.
And it was a man, a Chinese man,
and he was stacking these things, not with glue, not with anything.
And I asked him, "How is it possible to do this?"
And he said, "Well, I guess with everything in life, there's a place of balance."
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point.
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this, when I'm writing a story,
and I cannot explain it.
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence
in writing about these things?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain, like the cosmological constant?
And as I said, my mother did not believe in randomness.
What is the nature of accidents?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are,
outside of a court of law?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way,
when I went to beautiful Dong village, in Guizhou, the poorest province of China.
And I saw this beautiful place. I knew I wanted to come back.
And I had a chance to do that, when National Geographic asked me
if I wanted to write anything about China.
And I said yes, about this village of singing people, singing minority.
And they agreed, and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went,
there was a terrible accident. A man, an old man, fell asleep,
and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm.
60 homes were destroyed, and 40 were damaged.
Responsibility was assigned to the family.
The man's sons were banished to live three kilometers away, in a cowshed.
And, of course, as Westerners, we say, "Well, it was an accident. That's not fair.
It's the son, not the father."
It takes a while, but I have to let go of them and just go there, and be there.
And so I was there on three occasions, different seasons.
And I began to sense something different about the history,
and what had happened before, and the nature of life in a very poor village,
and what you find as your joys, and your rituals, your traditions, your links
with other families. And I saw how this had a kind of justice, in its responsibility.
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using,
a ceremony they hadn't used in about 29 years. And it was to send some men
-- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses.
Now you, as Westerners, and I, as Westerners,
would say well, that's superstition. But after being there for a while,
and seeing the amazing things that happened,
you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world,
determining how things happen.
the more I got into those beliefs, and I think that's important for me
-- to take on the beliefs, because that is where the story is real,
and that is where I'm gonna find the answers
to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life.
Years go by, of course, and the writing, it doesn't happen instantly,
as I'm trying to convey it to you here at TED.
The book comes and it goes. When it arrives, it is no longer my book.
It is in the hands of readers, and they interpret it differently.
But I go back to this question of, how do I create something out of nothing?
And how do I create my own life?
and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths.
I believe in specifics, the specifics of story,
and the past, the specifics of that past,
and what is happening in the story at that point.
I also believe that in thinking about things --
my thinking about luck, and fate, and coincidences and accidents,
God's will, and the synchrony of mysterious forces --
I will come to some notion of what that is, how we create.
I have to think of my role. Where I am in the universe,
and did somebody intend for me to be that way, or is it just something I came up with?
And I also can find that by imagining fully, and becoming what is imagined --
and yet is in that real world, the fictional world.
And that is how I find particles of truth, not the absolute truth, or the whole truth.
And they have to be in all possibilities,
including those I never considered before.
Or rather, if there is an answer, it is to remind
myself that there is uncertainty in everything,
and that is good, because then I will discover something new.
And if there is a partial answer, a more complete answer from me,
it is to simply imagine.
And to imagine is to put myself in that story,
until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating.
-- in one story -- then I come the closest, I think,
to knowing what compassion is, to feeling that compassion.
Because for everything,
in that question of how things happen, it has to do with the feeling.
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that.
We've come to the end of the talk,
and I will reveal what is in the bag, and it is the muse,
and it is the things that transform in our lives,
that are wonderful and stay with us.
There she is.
Thank you very much!
(Applause)
Allison Hunt: My three minutes hasn't started yet, has it?
Reset the three minutes, that's just not fair.
I mean I'm nervous enough as it is.
Five weeks ago I had total hip replacement surgery.
Do you know that surgery?
Electric saw, power drill, totally disgusting
unless you're David Bolinsky, in which case it's all truth and beauty.
Sure David, if it's not your hip, it's truth and beauty.
so Chris invited me to tell you about it.
But first you need to know two things about me.
Just two things.
I'm Canadian, and I'm the youngest of seven kids.
Now, in Canada, we have that great healthcare system.
That means we get our new hips for free.
And being the youngest of seven,
I have never been at the front of the line for anything. OK?
I finally went to the doctor, which was free.
And she referred me to an orthopedic surgeon, also free.
Finally got to see him after 10 months of waiting -- almost a year.
That is what free gets you.
I met the surgeon, and he took some free X-rays,
and I got a good look at them. And you know,
even I could tell my hip was bad,
and I actually work in marketing.
So he said, "Allison, we've got to get you on the table.
I'm going to replace your hip -- it's about an 18-month wait."
18 more months.
I'd already waited 10 months, and I had to wait 18 more months.
started to even think about it in terms of TEDs.
I wouldn't have my new hip for this TED.
I wouldn't have my new hip for TEDGlobal in Africa.
I would not have my new hip for TED2008.
I would still be on my bad hip. That was so disappointing.
and that's when I had my epiphany.
This youngest of seven had to get herself to the front of the line.
Oh yeah.
We do not think that way.
We don't talk about it. It's not even a consideration.
In fact, when we're traveling abroad, it's how we identify fellow Canadians.
"After you." "Oh, no, no. After you."
Hey, are you from Canada? "Oh, me too! Hi!"
"Great! Excellent!"
Some 70-year-old who wanted his new hip
so he could be back golfing, or gardening.
No, no. Front of the line.
because of my hip, and I kind of needed a sign.
And I saw a sign.
In the window of the hospital's tiny gift shop there was a sign
that said, "Volunteers Needed." Hmm.
Well, they signed me up immediately.
No reference checks. None of the usual background stuff, no.
They were desperate for volunteers
because the average age of the volunteer at the hospital gift shop was 75.
Yeah. They needed some young blood.
I had my photo ID, and I was fully trained by my 89-year-old boss.
I worked alone.
Every Friday morning I was at the gift shop.
While ringing in hospital staff's Tic Tacs,
I'd casually ask, "What do you do?"
Then I'd tell them, "Well, I'm getting my hip replaced -- in 18 months.
It's gonna be so great when the pain stops. Ow!"
All the staff got to know the plucky, young volunteer.
right after a shift at the gift shop.
So, naturally, I had my vest and my identification.
I draped them casually over the chair in the doctor's office.
And you know, when he walked in,
I could just tell that he saw them.
Moments later, I had a surgery date just weeks away,
and a big fat prescription for Percocet.
my volunteering that got me to the front of the line.
And, you know, I'm not even ashamed of that.
Two reasons.
First of all, I am going to take such good care of this new hip.
But also I intend to stick with the volunteering,
which actually leads me to the biggest epiphany of them all.
Even when a Canadian cheats the system,
they do it in a way that benefits society.
A great way to start, I think, with my view of simplicity
is to take a look at TED. Here you are, understanding why we're here,
what's going on with no difficulty at all.
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing,
and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable
but would miss the point.
(Laughter)
He would have a great time.
And of course, if you're a speaker here, like Hans Rosling,
a speaker finds this complex, tricky. But in Hans Rosling's case,
he had a secret weapon yesterday,
literally, in his sword swallowing act.
And I must say, I thought of quite a few objects
that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on,
but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing.
but that we're easily fooled. In fact, what Shakespeare
was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled,
so we're actually looking forward to it.
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled.
And this makes many things fun, but it makes it difficult to actually
get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves.
the "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain" lady, shows these two tables
to her drawing class and says,
"The problem you have with learning to draw
is not that you can't move your hand,
but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty.
It's trying to perceive images into objects
rather than seeing what's there."
And to prove it, she says, "The exact size and shape of these tabletops
is the same, and I'm going to prove it to you."
She does this with cardboard, but since I have
an expensive computer here
I'll just rotate this little guy around and ...
Now having seen that -- and I've seen it hundreds of times,
because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can't see
that they're the same size and shape, and I doubt that you can either.
They measure very, very carefully.
And if you measure very, very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge,
you'll see that those two shapes are
exactly the same size.
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago, saying,
"We see things not as they are, but as we are."
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person
who had that insight back then,
if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion.
then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination
happening inside here. It's a waking dream,
and understanding that that is what we actually exist in
is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history.
And what that means: "simple and understandable"
might not be actually simple or understandable,
and things we think are "complex" might be made simple and understandable.
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws.
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel.
The way I think of it is, we can't learn to see
until we admit we're blind.
Once you start down at this very humble level,
then you can start finding ways to see things.
And what's happened, over the last 400 years in particular,
is that human beings have invented "brainlets" --
little additional parts for our brain --
made out of powerful ideas that help us
see the world in different ways.
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus --
telescopes, microscopes -- reasoning apparatus --
various ways of thinking -- and, most importantly,
in the ability to change perspective on things.
It's this change in perspective
on what it is we think we're perceiving
that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years
than we have in the rest of human history.
And yet, it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I'm aware of.
is when we do more. We like more.
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way,
the simplicity gets complex
and, in fact, we can keep on doing it for a very long time.
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties;
another name for them could be "architecture"
as a metaphor for taking the same old material
and thinking about non-obvious, non-simple ways of combining it.
And in fact, what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature --
of having the descriptions
at various levels be rather similar --
all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles
are both sticky and standoffish,
and they're in violent motion.
Those three things give rise to all the different levels
of what seem to be complexity in our world.
So, when I saw Roslings' Gapminder stuff a few years ago,
I just thought it was the greatest thing I'd seen
in conveying complex ideas simply.
But then I had a thought of, "Boy, maybe it's too simple."
And I put some effort in to try and check
to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time
actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side,
and I found that they matched up very well.
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity
without removing what's important about the data.
of the simulation of the inside of a cell,
as a former molecular biologist, I didn't like that at all.
Not because it wasn't beautiful or anything,
but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand
about molecular biology, and that is:
why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes
finding each other just the right way
so they combine together and be catalyzed?
And what we saw yesterday was
every reaction was fortuitous;
they just swooped in the air and bound, and something happened.
But in fact, those molecules are spinning at the rate of
about a million revolutions per second;
they're agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds;
they're completely crowded together, they're jammed,
they're bashing up against each other.
And if you don't understand that in your mental model of this stuff,
what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous,
and I think that's exactly the wrong image
for when you're trying to teach science.
with the actual understanding of some principle.
So a kid who's 14 in high school
gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem,
which is a truly subtle and interesting proof,
but in fact it's not a good way to start learning about mathematics.
So a more direct one, one that gives you more of the feeling of math,
is something closer to Pythagoras' own proof, which goes like this:
so here we have this triangle, and if we surround that C square with
three more triangles and we copy that,
notice that we can move those triangles down like this.
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo. That is all you have to do.
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof
that you need to learn when you're learning mathematics
in order to get an idea of what it means
before you look into the, literally, 1,200 or 1,500 proofs
of Pythagoras' theorem that have been discovered.
This is a very unusual teacher
who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher,
but was a natural mathematician.
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music
but is a terrific musician;
she just had a feeling for math.
And here are her six-year-olds,
and she's got them making shapes out of a shape.
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond, or a square,
or a triangle, or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make
the next larger shape of that same shape, and the next larger shape.
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there.
was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project,
and then something like science.
So they had created these artifacts.
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious,
which I thought for a long time, until she explained to me was
to slow them down so they'll think.
So they're cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here
and pasting them up.
for them to look at this chart and fill it out.
"What have you noticed about what you did?"
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one,
and the second one took three more
and the total was four on that one,
the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one,
and then the next one.
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add
around the edges was always going to grow by two,
so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there.
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six,
where she wasn't sure what six times six was
and what seven times seven was,
but then she was confident again.
So that's what Lauren did.
bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor,
and everybody went batshit: "Holy shit! They're the same!"
No matter what the shapes were, the growth law is the same.
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd
will recognize these two progressions
as a first-order discrete differential equation
and a second-order discrete differential equation,
derived by six-year-olds.
Well, that's pretty amazing.
That isn't what we usually try to teach six-year-olds.
And so the first idea here is
just to show you the kind of things that children do.
I'm using the software that we're putting on the $100 laptop.
So I'd like to draw a little car here --
I'll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him.
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object,
I'll call it a car. And here's a little behavior: car forward.
Each time I click it, car turn.
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again,
I just drag these guys out and set them going.
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here?
So what if I click this down to zero?
It goes straight. That's a big revelation for nine-year-olds.
Make it go in the other direction.
But of course, that's a little bit like kissing your sister
as far as driving a car,
so the kids want to do a steering wheel;
so they draw a steering wheel.
And we'll call this a wheel.
See this wheel's heading here?
If I turn this wheel, you can see that number over there going minus and positive.
That's kind of an invitation to pick up this name of
those numbers coming out there
and to just drop it into the script here,
and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel.
You know how much trouble the children have with variables,
but by learning it this way, in a situated fashion,
they never forget from this single trial
what a variable is and how to use it.
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did.
So if you look at the little script here,
the speed is always going to be 30.
We're going to move the car according to that over and over again.
And I'm dropping a little dot for each one of these things;
they're evenly spaced because they're 30 apart.
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did
of saying, "OK, I'm going to increase the speed by two each time,
and then I'm going to increase the distance by the speed each time?
What do I get there?"
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration.
to what anybody else is doing.
Who's got the apple?
Student 2: What did you get? What did you get?
AK: Stopwatches aren't accurate enough.
because they're two totally different weights,
and if you drop them at the same time,
maybe they'll drop at the same speed.
about this particular point
because, of course, he didn't bother doing the experiment,
and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas.
And it was not until Galileo actually did it
that an adult thought like a child,
only 400 years ago.
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids
who will actually cut straight to the chase.
We can take a movie of what's going on,
but even if we single stepped this movie,
it's tricky to see what's going on.
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side
or stack them up.
So when the children see this, they say, "Ah! Acceleration,"
remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways,
and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is.
So what I'm doing is measuring from the bottom of one image
to the bottom of the next image, about a fifth of a second later,
like that. And they're getting faster and faster each time,
and if I stack these guys up, then we see the differences; the increase
in the speed is constant.
And they say, "Oh, yeah. Constant acceleration.
We've done that already."
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it?
So you can't tell much from just making the ball drop there,
but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time,
we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model.
by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute.
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that
this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story,
but it's a great story.
And I thought I would do just one thing
on the $100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here.
So once you have gravity, here's this --
increase the speed by something,
increase the ship's speed.
If I start the little game here that the kids have done,
it'll crash the space ship.
But if I oppose gravity, here we go ... Oops!
(Laughter)
One more.
Yeah, there we go. Yeah, OK?
Marshall McLuhan said,
"Children are the messages that we send to the future,"
but in fact, if you think of it,
children are the future we send to the future.
Forget about messages;
children are the future,
and children in the first and second world
and, most especially, in the third world
need mentors.
And this summer, we're going to build five million of these $100 laptops,
and maybe 50 million next year.
But we couldn't create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life.
That means that we, once again, have a thing where we can put technology out,
but the mentoring that is required to go
from a simple new iChat instant messaging system
to something with depth is missing.
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface,
and this new kind of user interface could be done
with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars.
It sounds like a lot, but it is literally 18 minutes of what we're spending in Iraq --
we're spending 8 billion dollars a month; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars --
so this is actually cheap.
And Einstein said,
"Things should be as simple as possible, but not simpler."
Thank you.
and the quality of life.
So it was a great idea that didn't work at all.
there's a lot of really great computational work you can do.
a lot of great refrigeration people, it turns out, in the UK --
It weighs about eight pounds, and this is the way it works.
and it'll cool it down to just above freezing --
for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment.
So, can we dare to be optimistic?
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"
is that a billion people have been stuck living
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,
It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"
That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.
a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.
Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies
that have not offered credible hope.
That is a human tragedy.
Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence
continues for another 40 years,
combined with social integration globally,
it will build a nightmare for our children.
We need compassion to get ourselves started,
and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.
That's the alliance that changes the world.
What can we actually do?
Well, a good guide is to think,
"What did we do last time the rich world got serious
about developing another region of the world?"
That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,
except you have to go back quite a long time.
The last time the rich world got serious
about developing another region was in the late 1940s.
The rich world was you, America,
and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.
That was post-War Europe.
It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.
It was that you knew you had to,
because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe
was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.
Europe had to be dragged into economic development.
Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.
That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.
But what else did you do?
Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.
Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.
you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,
and you institutionalized that trade liberalization
through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
So, total reversal of trade policy.
Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.
Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.
After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe
for over 40 years.
So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?
Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --
national sovereignty.
Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct
that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.
After the war, you found the United Nations,
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --
all systems for mutual government support.
That is still the waterfront of effective policies:
because the challenge is different.
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence
for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.
Is that easier or harder?
We need to be at least as serious as we were then.
the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --
governments, mutual systems of support for governments --
and I'm going to show you one idea
in how we could do something to strengthen governance,
and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.
The opportunity we're going to look to
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,
and that is the commodity booms.
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money
into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,
but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;
Ghana has discovered oil;
Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.
So, a mass of new discoveries.
Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.
Just to give you one example:
Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.
So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms
to the bottom billion are without precedent.
So there's the optimism.
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.
Will it be taken?
So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done
since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.
I've looked to see what is the relationship between
higher commodity prices of exports,
and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.
And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world
for the last 40 years,
and looked to see what the relationship is.
And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.
but also that drives up output across the board.
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.
And how about the long run?
Come back 15 years later.
Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,
but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.
You go up in the short run, but then most societies
historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;
it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,
for growth of an increase in prices.
And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out
that the critical issue is the level of governance,
the initial level of economic governance,
when the resource booms accrue.
In fact, if you've got good enough governance,
there is no resource boom.
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.
That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries
below a threshold of governance.
They still go up in the short run.
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.
The best growth rates they've had -- ever.
And the question is whether the short run will persist.
And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.
It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.
and below which you go down.
Just to benchmark that threshold,
it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.
So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?
Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,
which has transformed governance in the bottom billion.
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.
So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --
and unfortunately, they're adverse.
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.
(Laughter)
-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:
there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,
and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing
that's doing the damage with democracy,
whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.
And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need
is very strong checks and balances.
They haven't got them.
They got instant democracy in the 1990s:
elections without checks and balances.
In all the societies of the bottom billion,
there are intense struggles to do just that.
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,
which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points
that need to be taken in order
because we've already got one.
It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
That is the very simple idea that governments should report
to their citizens what revenues they have.
No sooner was it proposed
than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.
Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.
People wanted to know what their government was getting
in terms of revenue.
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --
the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground
and putting assets on top of the ground.
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,
how they've been sold over the last 40 years?
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.
And that's great for the company,
and it's quite often great for the minister --
(Laughter)
-- and it's not great for their country.
There's a very simple institutional technology
which can transform that,
and it's called verified auctions.
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth
is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights
to third-generation mobile phones
by working out what those rights were worth.
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.
Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,
"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,
think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.
(Laughter)
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,
the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team
to give expertise on how to conduct auctions.
each one needs an international standard.
If we could do it, we would change the world.
We would be helping the reformers in these societies,
who are struggling for change.
That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,
because the odds are so stacked against them.
And yet, we've not got these rules.
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules
is zilch -- nothing.
Why on Earth are they not there?
I realized that the reason they're not there
is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,
politicians will get away with gestures.
That unless we have an informed society,
what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:
things that look good, but don't work.
And so I realized we had to go through the business
of building an informed citizenry.
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.
(Laughter).
However, I have to say, the process of communication
does not come naturally to me.
This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.
I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,
and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --
(Laughter)
-- but his arguments are compelling."
(Laughter)
If you agree with that sentiment,
Thank you.
(Applause)
This is the Large Hadron Collider.
It's 27 kilometers in circumference.
It's the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted.
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers
from 85 countries around the world
have come together over several decades
to build this machine.
What we do is we accelerate protons --
so, hydrogen nuclei --
around 99.999999
percent the speed of light.
Right? At that speed, they go around
that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second.
And we collide them with another beam of protons
going in the opposite direction.
We collide them inside giant detectors.
And this is the one that I work on, ATLAS.
You get some sense of the size --
you can just see these EU standard-size
people underneath.
22 meters in diameter, 7,000 tons.
And we re-create the conditions that were present
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began
up to 600 million times a second
inside that detector -- immense numbers.
And if you see those metal bits there --
those are huge magnets that bend
electrically charged particles,
so it can measure how fast they're traveling.
This is a picture about a year ago.
Those magnets are in there.
And, again, a EU standard-size, real person,
so you get some sense of the scale.
And it's in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created,
sometime in the summer this year.
saying that we've just finished, today,
building the last piece of ATLAS.
So as of today, it's finished. I'd like to say
that I planned that for TED,
but I didn't. So it's been completed as of today.
So, you might be asking, "Why?
Why create the conditions that were present
less than a billionth of a second after the universe began?"
Well, particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious.
And the aim of particle physics is to understand
what everything's made of, and how everything sticks together.
And by everything I mean, of course,
me and you, the Earth, the Sun,
the 100 billion suns in our galaxy
and the 100 billion galaxies
in the observable universe.
Absolutely everything.
You know? If you want to know what I'm made of, let's look at me."
Well, we found that as you look back in time,
the universe gets hotter and hotter,
denser and denser, and simpler and simpler.
Now, there's no real reason I'm aware of for that,
but that seems to be the case.
So, way back in the early times of the universe,
we believe it was very simple and understandable.
All this complexity, all the way to these wonderful things --
human brains -- are a property of an old
and cold and complicated universe.
Back at the start, in the first billionth of a second,
we believe, or we've observed, it was very simple.
imagine a snowflake in your hand,
and you look at it, and it's an incredibly complicated,
beautiful object. But as you heat it up,
it'll melt into a pool of water,
and you would be able to see that, actually, it was just made
of H20, water.
So it's in that same sense that we look back in time
to understand what the universe is made of.
And, as of today, it's made of these things.
Just 12 particles of matter,
stuck together by four forces of nature.
The quarks, these pink things, are the things that make up protons and neutrons
that make up the atomic nuclei in your body.
The electron -- the thing that goes around
the atomic nucleus --
held around in orbit, by the way, by the electromagnetic force
that's carried by this thing, the photon.
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons.
probably the least familiar.
But, without it, the sun wouldn't shine.
And when the sun shines, you get copious quantities
of these things, called neutrinos, pouring out.
Actually, if you just look at your thumbnail --
about a square centimeter --
there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second
from the sun, passing
through every square centimeter of your body.
But you don't feel them, because the weak force
is correctly named --
very short range and very weak,
so they just fly through you.
over the last century, pretty much.
The first one, the electron, was discovered in 1897,
and the last one, this thing called the tau neutrino,
in the year 2000. Actually just --
I was going to say, just up the road in Chicago. I know it's a big country,
America, isn't it?
Just up the road.
Relative to the universe, it's just up the road.
so it's a relatively recent picture.
One of the wonderful things, actually, I find,
is that we've discovered any of them, when you realize how tiny they are.
You know, they're a step in size
from the entire observable universe.
So, 100 billion galaxies,
13.7 billion light years away --
a step in size from that to Monterey, actually,
is about the same as from Monterey to these things.
Absolutely, exquisitely minute,
and yet we've discovered pretty much the full set.
at Manchester University, Ernest Rutherford,
discoverer of the atomic nucleus,
once said, "All science is either physics
or stamp collecting."
Now, I don't think he meant to insult
the rest of science,
although he was from New Zealand, so it's possible.
is stamp collect there.
OK, we've discovered the particles,
but unless you understand the underlying
reason for that pattern -- you know, why it's built the way it is --
really you've done stamp collecting. You haven't done science.
Fortunately, we have
probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century
that underpins that pattern.
It's the Newton's laws, if you want,
of particle physics.
It's called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation.
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt,
which is always the sign of elegance.
This is it.
in all its gory detail.
This equation, though, allows you to calculate everything --
other than gravity -- that happens in the universe.
So, you want to know why the sky is blue, why atomic nuclei stick together --
in principle, you've got a big enough computer --
why DNA is the shape it is.
In principle, you should be able to calculate it from that equation.
Can anyone see what it is?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me.
I'll make it easier, actually, by blowing one of the lines up.
Basically, each of these terms
refers to some of the particles.
So those Ws there refer to the Ws, and how they stick together.
These carriers of the weak force, the Zs, the same.
But there's an extra symbol in this equation: H.
Right, H.
H stands for Higgs particle.
Higgs particles have not been discovered.
But they're necessary: they're necessary
to make that mathematics work.
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do
with that wonderful equation
wouldn't be possible without an extra bit.
So it's a prediction:
a prediction of a new particle.
Well, we had a long time to come up with good analogies.
And back in the 1980s, when we wanted the money
for the LHC from the U.K. government,
Margaret Thatcher, at the time, said,
"If you guys can explain, in language
a politician can understand,
what the hell it is that you're doing, you can have the money.
I want to know what this Higgs particle does."
And we came up with this analogy, and it seemed to work.
Well, what the Higgs does is, it gives mass to the fundamental particles.
And the picture is that the whole universe --
and that doesn't mean just space, it means me as well, and inside you --
the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field.
Higgs particles, if you will.
are the Higgs particles.
Now when a particle moves through the universe,
it can interact with these Higgs particles.
But imagine someone who's not very popular moves through the room.
Then everyone ignores them. They can just pass through the room very quickly,
essentially at the speed of light. They're massless.
And imagine someone incredibly important
and popular and intelligent
walks into the room.
They're surrounded by people, and their passage through the room is impeded.
It's almost like they get heavy. They get massive.
And that's exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works.
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks
in your body and in the universe that we see around us
are heavy, in a sense, and massive,
because they're surrounded by Higgs particles.
They're interacting with the Higgs field.
then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC.
If it's not true -- because it's quite a convoluted mechanism,
although it's the simplest we've been able to think of --
then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles
we know have to turn up
at the LHC.
So, that's one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine.
I'm glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher.
Actually, I thought about making it more culturally relevant, but --
(Laughter)
anyway.
So that's one thing.
That's essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find.
many of the big problems in particle physics.
One of them you heard about: dark matter, dark energy.
There's another issue,
which is that the forces in nature -- it's quite beautiful, actually --
seem, as you go back in time,
they seem to change in strength.
Well, they do change in strength.
So, the electromagnetic force, the force that holds us together,
gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures.
The strong force, the strong nuclear force, which sticks nuclei together,
gets weaker. And what you see is the standard model --
you can calculate how these change -- is the forces,
the three forces, other than gravity,
almost seem to come together at one point.
It's almost as if there was one beautiful
kind of super-force, back at the beginning of time.
But they just miss.
which doubles the number of particles in the standard model,
which, at first sight, doesn't sound like a simplification.
But actually, with this theory,
we find that the forces of nature
do seem to unify together, back at the Big Bang --
absolutely beautiful prophecy. The model wasn't built to do that,
but it seems to do it.
Also, those super-symmetric particles
are very strong candidates for the dark matter.
So a very compelling theory
that's really mainstream physics.
And if I was to put money on it, I would put money on --
in a very unscientific way -- that
that these things would also crop up at the LHC.
Many other things that the LHC could discover.
a different perspective
of what I think -- what particle physics
really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology.
And that's that I think it's given us a wonderful
narrative -- almost a creation story,
if you'd like -- about the universe,
from modern science over the last few decades.
And I'd say that it deserves,
in the spirit of Wade Davis' talk,
to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories
of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north.
This is a creation story, I think, equally as wonderful.
the universe began 13.7 billion years ago,
in an immensely hot, dense state,
much smaller than a single atom.
It began to expand about
a million, billion, billion, billion billionth
of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang.
Gravity separated away from the other forces.
The universe then underwent
an exponential expansion called inflation.
In about the first billionth of a second or so,
the Higgs field kicked in, and the quarks
and the gluons and the electrons
that make us up got mass.
The universe continued to expand and cool.
After about a few minutes,
there was hydrogen and helium in the universe. That's all.
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen,
25 percent helium. It still is today.
about 300 million years.
Then light began to travel through the universe.
It was big enough to be transparent to light,
and that's what we see in the cosmic microwave background
that George Smoot described
as looking at the face of God.
After about 400 million years, the first stars formed,
and that hydrogen, that helium, then began to cook
into the heavier elements.
So the elements of life --
carbon, and oxygen and iron,
all the elements that we need to make us up --
were cooked in those first generations of stars,
which then ran out of fuel, exploded,
threw those elements back into the universe.
They then re-collapsed into another generation
of stars and planets.
in that first generation of stars, could fuse with hydrogen
to form water, liquid water on the surface.
On at least one, and maybe only one of those planets,
primitive life evolved,
which evolved over millions of years into
things that walked upright and left footprints
about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania,
and eventually
left a footprint on another world.
And built this civilization,
this wonderful picture,
that turned the darkness into light,
and you can see the civilization from space.
As one of my great heroes, Carl Sagan, said,
these are the things -- and actually, not only these,
but I was looking around -- these are the things,
like Saturn V rockets, and Sputnik,
and DNA, and literature and science --
these are the things that hydrogen atoms do
when given 13.7 billion years.
And, the laws of physics. Right?
So, the right laws of physics --
they're beautifully balanced.
If the weak force had been a little bit different,
then carbon and oxygen wouldn't be stable
inside the hearts of stars,
and there would be none of that in the universe.
And I think that's
a wonderful and significant story.
50 years ago, I couldn't have told that story,
because we didn't know it.
It makes me really feel that
that civilization --
which, as I say, if you believe
the scientific creation story,
has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics,
and a few hydrogen atoms --
then I think, to me anyway,
it makes me feel incredibly valuable.
The LHC is certainly, when it turns on in summer,
going to write the next chapter of that book.
And I'm certainly looking forward with
immense excitement to it being turned on.
Thanks.
How many Creationists do we have in the room?
Beaver dams, yes. Hoover Dam, no.
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity
from being themselves, fruits of the tree of life,
and hence, in some sense, obeying evolutionary rules?
And yet people are interestingly resistant
keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here.
So you're out in the woods, or you're out in the pasture,
and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass.
It climbs up to the top, and it falls,
and it climbs, and it falls, and it climbs --
trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass.
What is this ant doing? What is this in aid of?
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass?
What's in it for the ant?
And the answer is: nothing. There's nothing in it for the ant.
Well then, why is it doing this?
Is it just a fluke?
It's a little brain worm.
It's a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow
in order to continue its life cycle.
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds,
The ant's brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain,
inducing suicidal behavior.
Pretty scary.
Well, it may already have occurred to you
Well, it's ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains.
Now, am I saying that a sizable minority of the world's population
has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas?
No, it's worse than that.
Most people have.
(Laughter)
There are a lot of ideas to die for.
Freedom, if you're from New Hampshire.
(Laughter)
Justice. Truth. Communism.
Many people have laid down their lives for communism,
and many have laid down their lives for capitalism.
And many for Catholicism. And many for Islam.
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for.
They're infectious.
It was a term of abuse, in effect.
This is unthinking engineering.
Well, most of the cultural spread that goes on
is not brilliant, new, out-of-the-box thinking.
It's "infectious repetitis,"
so that we can understand the conditions of infection.
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others.
is that people ask us what the meaning of life is.
And you have to have a bumper sticker,
you know. You have to have a statement.
So, this is mine.
and dedicate your life to it.
now we actually do this.
This is what our summum bonum is.
It's not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have.
Now, this is a profound biological effect.
It's the subordination of genetic interest to other interests.
And no other species does anything at all like it.
It is, on the one hand, a biological effect, and a very large one.
Unmistakable.
Now, what theories do we want to use to look at this?
ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain.
Now here am I talking about his idea.
Well, you see, it's not his. Yes -- he started it.
But it's everybody's idea now.
And he's not responsible for what I say about memes.
I'm responsible for what I say about memes.
for not just the intended effects of our ideas,
but for their likely misuses.
So it is important, I think, to Richard, and to me,
that these ideas not be abused and misused.
They're very easy to misuse. That's why they're dangerous.
And it's just about a full-time job
trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas
from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another.
So we have to keep plugging away,
trying to correct the misapprehensions
But it is a problem.
because there's a lot of other things that are going to be said.
That's what Richard said, back in '93.
And you might think, "Well, how can that be?
Yesterday, Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications
but -- what's a virus?
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude.
(Laughter)
That is, there is something about it
that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does.
And that's what a meme is. It's an information packet with attitude.
What's a meme made of? What are bits made of, Mom?
Not silicon.
What's a word made of?
Sometimes when people say, "Do memes exist?"
If they are, words are memes that can be pronounced.
Remember the Shakers? Gift to be simple?
Simple, beautiful furniture?
And, of course, they're basically extinct now.
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom
is that one should be celibate.
But in fact that's not why they went extinct.
And so they had a ready supply of converts.
And they could keep it going.
The idea being passed on through proselytizing,
instead of through the gene line.
After all, the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite.
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile.
It's part of their plan.
They don't have to have minds to have a plan.
he talks about how it was germs, more than guns and steel,
When European explorers and travelers spread out,
they brought with them the germs
that they had become essentially immune to,
that they had learned how to tolerate over
hundreds and hundreds of years, thousands of years,
of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens.
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people,
who had no immunity to them at all.
We're doing it this time with toxic ideas.
Yesterday, a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others --
spoke about all the wonderful things
that are happening when our ideas get spread out,
thanks to all the new technology all over the world.
And I agree. It is largely wonderful. Largely wonderful.
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world
thanks to our technology, are a lot of toxic ideas.
Now, this has been realized for some time.
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam,
one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden.
ballrooms, wine bars and broadcasting stations." Memes.
and they are wiping out whole cultures.
They are wiping out languages.
They are wiping out traditions and practices.
to people that haven't developed the immunity.
They're like a mild cold.
They're not a big deal for us.
But we should recognize that for many people in the world,
they are a big deal.
And we should be very alert to this.
As we spread our education and our technology,
as a dire threat to their favorite memes --
the memes that they are prepared to die for.
That is not the job of the science of memetics.
Memetics is morally neutral. And so it should be.
This is not the place for hate and anger.
If you've had a friend who's died of AIDS, then you hate HIV.
But the way to deal with that is to do science,
Work out the implications.
And, as with germs, the trick is not to try to annihilate them.
You will never annihilate the germs.
that will encourage the evolution of avirulence.
of the most toxic varieties.
That's all the time I have,
so thank you very much for your attention.
Suppose that two American friends are traveling together in Italy.
They go to see Michelangelo's "David,"
and when they finally come face-to-face with the statue,
they both freeze dead in their tracks.
The first guy -- we'll call him Adam --

on a major personality trait called openness to experience.
Here's the description of a group I found on the web.
What kinds of people would join
This is from some guy named Ted.
on social issues, primarily --
Please raise your hand if you'd say you're libertarian.
OK. About two dozen.
our general lack of moral diversity here is going to make it harder.
Because when people all share values, when people all share morals,
it shuts down open-minded thinking.
because they are blinded in this way,
then my message to you is that you're trapped in a moral Matrix,
in a particular moral Matrix.
And by "the Matrix," I mean literally the Matrix, like the movie "The Matrix."
I was going to ask which one you picked, but no need.
You're all high in openness to experience,
The worst idea in all of psychology
is the idea that the mind is a blank slate at birth.

'Built-in' doesn't mean unmalleable;
it means organized in advance of experience."
We're all mammals here, we all have a lot of neural and hormonal programming
that makes us really bond with others, care for others,
feel compassion for others, especially the weak and vulnerable.
It gives us very strong feelings about those who cause harm.

There's actually ambiguous evidence
as to whether you find reciprocity in other animals,
That second foundation underlies the other 30 percent
but these groups are always either very small or they're all siblings.
It's only among humans that you find very large groups of people
who are able to cooperate and join together into groups,
but in this case, groups that are united to fight other groups.
as it is in other primates.
This painting is called "The Allegory Of Chastity,"
but purity is not just about suppressing female sexuality.
It's about any kind of ideology, any kind of idea
And while the political right may moralize sex much more,
the political left is doing a lot of it with food.
Food is becoming extremely moralized nowadays.
A lot of it is ideas about purity,
about what you're willing to touch or put into your body.
for what's written on the first draft of the moral mind.
But as my son Max grows up in a liberal college town,
And how will it end up being different

five sources of intuitions and emotions,
On the left are the scores for liberals;
on the right, conservatives; in the middle, moderates.
But look at the other three lines.
For liberals, the scores are very low.
They're basically saying, "This is not morality.
The UK, Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, Eastern Europe,
Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia and South Asia.
Notice also that on all of these graphs,
the slope is steeper on in-group, authority, purity,
which shows that, within any country,
the disagreement isn't over harm and fairness.
Moral arguments within cultures
are especially about issues of in-group, authority, purity.
In a recent study, we asked people,
suppose you're about to get a dog,
and relates to its owner as a friend and an equal.
If you're a liberal, you say, "That's great!"
because liberals like to say, "Fetch! Please."
If you're conservative and learn that a dog's extremely loyal
But to a liberal,
What makes them moral?
We get every person doing whatever he wants,

The truth of social entropy.
told in a paper that was published in "Nature" a few years ago,
in which Ernst Fehr and Simon Gächter had people play a commons dilemma,
a game in which you give people money,
and then, on each round of the game,
they can put money into a common pot,
then the experimenter doubles what's there,
and then it's all divided among the players.
So it's a nice analog for all sorts of environmental issues,
where we're asking people to make a sacrifice
This is all played anonymously.
If you want to give some of your own money
Lots of research shows that to solve cooperative problems, it really helps.
It's not enough to appeal to people's good motives.
There's even some recent research suggesting that religion --
priming God, making people think about God --
often, in some situations, leads to more cooperative, more pro-social behavior.

and being more effective at competing with other groups.
The Grand Canyon is really simple --
a lot of rock and a lot of water and wind and a lot of time,
and you get the Grand Canyon.
It's not that complicated.
How did this happen?
and if those subgroups have some internal structure,
and if you have some ideology that tells people
to suppress their carnality -- to pursue higher, nobler ends.
Traditional authority and morality can be quite repressive and restrictive
to those at the bottom, to women, to people who don't fit in.
Liberals speak for the weak and oppressed.
So as Edmund Burke said, "The restraints on men,
that they form a balance on change versus stability,
then I think the way is open to step outside the moral Matrix.
You find the same thing in Hinduism.
There are many high gods in Hinduism.
Two of them are Vishnu, the preserver, and Shiva, the destroyer.
Do you accept stepping out of the battle of good and evil?
Can you be not for or against anything?
from ancient Asian philosophies and religions
and then to blind us to the truth.
Am I telling you to embrace Sēngcàn and stop,
stop with the struggle of for and against?
This is an amazing group of people who are doing so much,
because, as we just heard, everybody thinks they are right.
even if it's just for a moment, step out -- check in with Sēngcàn.
just try to see it as a struggle playing out,
everybody has some reasons for what they're doing.
Step out.
And if you do that, that's the essential move to cultivate moral humility,
Think about the enormous moral authority of the Dalai Lama.
It comes from his moral humility.
is that this is a group that is passionately engaged
in the pursuit of changing the world for the better.
in trying to make the world a better place.
You know, one of the intense pleasures of travel
and one of the delights of ethnographic research
is the opportunity to live amongst those
who have not forgotten the old ways,
who still feel their past in the wind,
touch it in stones polished by rain,
taste it in the bitter leaves of plants.
Just to know that Jaguar shamans still journey beyond the Milky Way,
or the myths of the Inuit elders still resonate with meaning,
or that in the Himalaya,
the Buddhists still pursue the breath of the Dharma,
is to really remember the central revelation of anthropology,
and that is the idea that the world in which we live
does not exist in some absolute sense,
but is just one model of reality,
the consequence of one particular set of adaptive choices
that our lineage made, albeit successfully, many generations ago.
We're all born. We all bring our children into the world.
We go through initiation rites.
We have to deal with the inexorable separation of death,
so it shouldn't surprise us that we all sing, we all dance,
we all have art.
the rhythm of the dance in every culture.
And whether it is the Penan in the forests of Borneo,
or the Voodoo acolytes in Haiti,
or the warriors in the Kaisut desert of Northern Kenya,
the Curandero in the mountains of the Andes,
or a caravanserai in the middle of the Sahara --
this is incidentally the fellow that I traveled into the desert with
a month ago --
or indeed a yak herder in the slopes of Qomolangma,
Everest, the goddess mother of the world.
other ways of thinking,
other ways of orienting yourself in the Earth.
And this is an idea, if you think about it,
can only fill you with hope.
Now, together the myriad cultures of the world
make up a web of spiritual life and cultural life
that envelops the planet,
and is as important to the well-being of the planet
as indeed is the biological web of life that you know as a biosphere.
And you might think of this cultural web of life
as being an ethnosphere,
and you might define the ethnosphere
as being the sum total of all thoughts and dreams, myths,
ideas, inspirations, intuitions brought into being
by the human imagination since the dawn of consciousness.
The ethnosphere is humanity's great legacy.
It's the symbol of all that we are
and all that we can be as an astonishingly inquisitive species.
so too is the ethnosphere
-- and, if anything, at a far greater rate.
No biologists, for example, would dare suggest
that 50 percent of all species or more have been or are
on the brink of extinction because it simply is not true,
and yet that -- the most apocalyptic scenario
in the realm of biological diversity --
scarcely approaches what we know to be the most optimistic scenario
in the realm of cultural diversity.
And the great indicator of that, of course, is language loss.
there were 6,000 languages spoken on the planet.
Now, a language is not just a body of vocabulary
or a set of grammatical rules.
A language is a flash of the human spirit.
It's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture
comes into the material world.
Every language is an old-growth forest of the mind,
a watershed, a thought, an ecosystem of spiritual possibilities.
fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children.
They're no longer being taught to babies,
which means, effectively, unless something changes,
they're already dead.
What could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence,
to be the last of your people to speak your language,
to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors
or anticipate the promise of the children?
And yet, that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody
somewhere on Earth roughly every two weeks,
because every two weeks, some elder dies
and carries with him into the grave the last syllables
of an ancient tongue.
wouldn't the world be a better place
if we all just spoke one language?" And I say, "Great,
let's make that language Yoruba. Let's make it Cantonese.
Let's make it Kogi."
And you'll suddenly discover what it would be like
to be unable to speak your own language.
is sort of take you on a journey through the ethnosphere,
a brief journey through the ethnosphere,
to try to begin to give you a sense of what in fact is being lost.
Now, there are many of us who sort of forget
that when I say "different ways of being,"
I really do mean different ways of being.
the people of the anaconda
who believe that mythologically they came up the milk river
from the east in the belly of sacred snakes.
Now, this is a people who cognitively
do not distinguish the color blue from the color green
because the canopy of the heavens
is equated to the canopy of the forest
upon which the people depend.
They have a curious language and marriage rule
which is called "linguistic exogamy:"
you must marry someone who speaks a different language.
And this is all rooted in the mythological past,
yet the curious thing is in these long houses,
where there are six or seven languages spoken
because of intermarriage,
you never hear anyone practicing a language.
They simply listen and then begin to speak.
the Waorani of northeastern Ecuador,
an astonishing people first contacted peacefully in 1958.
In 1957, five missionaries attempted contact
and made a critical mistake.
They dropped from the air
8 x 10 glossy photographs of themselves
in what we would say to be friendly gestures,
forgetting that these people of the rainforest
had never seen anything two-dimensional in their lives.
They picked up these photographs from the forest floor,
tried to look behind the face to find the form or the figure,
found nothing, and concluded that these were calling cards
from the devil, so they speared the five missionaries to death.
But the Waorani didn't just spear outsiders.
They speared each other.
54 percent of their mortality was due to them spearing each other.
We traced genealogies back eight generations,
and we found two instances of natural death
and when we pressured the people a little bit about it,
they admitted that one of the fellows had gotten so old
that he died getting old, so we speared him anyway. (Laughter)
But at the same time they had a perspicacious knowledge
of the forest that was astonishing.
Their hunters could smell animal urine at 40 paces
and tell you what species left it behind.
when I was asked by my professor at Harvard
if I was interested in going down to Haiti,
infiltrating the secret societies
which were the foundation of Duvalier's strength
and Tonton Macoutes,
and securing the poison used to make zombies.
In order to make sense out of sensation, of course,
I had to understand something about this remarkable faith
of Vodoun. And Voodoo is not a black magic cult.
On the contrary, it's a complex metaphysical worldview.
It's interesting.
If I asked you to name the great religions of the world,
what would you say?
Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Judaism, whatever.
the assumption being that sub-Saharan Africa
had no religious beliefs. Well, of course, they did
and Voodoo is simply the distillation
of these very profound religious ideas
that came over during the tragic Diaspora of the slavery era.
But, what makes Voodoo so interesting
is that it's this living relationship
between the living and the dead.
So, the living give birth to the spirits.
The spirits can be invoked from beneath the Great Water,
responding to the rhythm of the dance
to momentarily displace the soul of the living,
so that for that brief shining moment, the acolyte becomes the god.
That's why the Voodooists like to say
that "You white people go to church and speak about God.
We dance in the temple and become God."
And because you are possessed, you are taken by the spirit --
how can you be harmed?
So you see these astonishing demonstrations:
Voodoo acolytes in a state of trance
handling burning embers with impunity,
a rather astonishing demonstration of the ability of the mind
to affect the body that bears it
when catalyzed in the state of extreme excitation.
the most extraordinary are the Kogi
of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in northern Colombia.
Descendants of the ancient Tairona civilization
which once carpeted the Caribbean coastal plain of Colombia,
in the wake of the conquest,
these people retreated into an isolated volcanic massif
that soars above the Caribbean coastal plain.
In a bloodstained continent,
these people alone were never conquered by the Spanish.
To this day, they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood
but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary.
The young acolytes are taken away from their families
at the age of three and four,
sequestered in a shadowy world of darkness
in stone huts at the base of glaciers for 18 years:
two nine-year periods
deliberately chosen to mimic the nine months of gestation
they spend in their natural mother's womb;
now they are metaphorically in the womb of the great mother.
And for this entire time,
they are inculturated into the values of their society,
values that maintain the proposition that their prayers
and their prayers alone maintain the cosmic --
or we might say the ecological -- balance.
And at the end of this amazing initiation,
one day they're suddenly taken out
and for the first time in their lives, at the age of 18,
they see a sunrise. And in that crystal moment of awareness
of first light as the Sun begins to bathe the slopes
of the stunningly beautiful landscape,
suddenly everything they have learned in the abstract
is affirmed in stunning glory. And the priest steps back
and says, "You see? It's really as I've told you.
It is that beautiful. It is yours to protect."
They call themselves the "elder brothers"
and they say we, who are the younger brothers,
are the ones responsible for destroying the world.
Whenever we think of indigenous people and landscape,
we either invoke Rousseau
and the old canard of the "noble savage,"
which is an idea racist in its simplicity,
or alternatively, we invoke Thoreau
and say these people are closer to the Earth than we are.
Well, indigenous people are neither sentimental
nor weakened by nostalgia.
There's not a lot of room for either
in the malarial swamps of the Asmat
or in the chilling winds of Tibet, but they have, nevertheless,
through time and ritual, forged a traditional mystique of the Earth
that is based not on the idea of being self-consciously close to it,
but on a far subtler intuition:
the idea that the Earth itself can only exist
because it is breathed into being by human consciousness.
It means that a young kid from the Andes
who's raised to believe that that mountain is an Apu spirit
that will direct his or her destiny
will be a profoundly different human being
and have a different relationship to that resource
or that place than a young kid from Montana
raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock
ready to be mined.
Whether it's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant.
What's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship
between the individual and the natural world.
I was raised in the forests of British Columbia
to believe those forests existed to be cut.
That made me a different human being
than my friends amongst the Kwagiulth
who believe that those forests were the abode of Huxwhukw
and the Crooked Beak of Heaven
and the cannibal spirits that dwelled at the north end of the world,
spirits they would have to engage during their Hamatsa initiation.
that these cultures could create different realities,
you could begin to understand
some of their extraordinary discoveries. Take this plant here.
It's a photograph I took in the Northwest Amazon just last April.
This is ayahuasca, which many of you have heard about,
the most powerful psychoactive preparation
of the shaman's repertoire.
What makes ayahuasca fascinating
is not the sheer pharmacological potential of this preparation,
but the elaboration of it. It's made really of two different sources:
on the one hand, this woody liana
which has in it a series of beta-carbolines,
harmine, harmaline, mildly hallucinogenic --
to take the vine alone
is rather to have sort of blue hazy smoke
drift across your consciousness --
but it's mixed with the leaves of a shrub in the coffee family
called Psychotria viridis.
This plant had in it some very powerful tryptamines,
very close to brain serotonin, dimethyltryptamine,
5-methoxydimethyltryptamine.
If you've ever seen the Yanomami
blowing that snuff up their noses,
that substance they make from a different set of species
also contains methoxydimethyltryptamine.
To have that powder blown up your nose
is rather like being shot out of a rifle barrel
lined with baroque paintings and landing on a sea of electricity. (Laughter)
It doesn't create the distortion of reality;
it creates the dissolution of reality.
who is a man who sparked the psychedelic era
with his discovery of the magic mushrooms
in Mexico in the 1930s --
I used to argue that you couldn't classify these tryptamines
as hallucinogenic because by the time you're under the effects
there's no one home anymore to experience a hallucination. (Laughter)
because they're denatured by an enzyme
found naturally in the human gut called monoamine oxidase.
They can only be taken orally if taken in conjunction
with some other chemical that denatures the MAO.
Now, the fascinating things
are that the beta-carbolines found within that liana
are MAO inhibitors of the precise sort necessary
to potentiate the tryptamine. So you ask yourself a question.
How, in a flora of 80,000 species of vascular plants,
do these people find these two morphologically unrelated plants
that when combined in this way,
created a kind of biochemical version
of the whole being greater than the sum of the parts?
which is exposed to be meaningless.
But you ask the Indians, and they say, "The plants talk to us."
This tribe, the Cofan, has 17 varieties of ayahuasca,
all of which they distinguish a great distance in the forest,
all of which are referable to our eye as one species.
And then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy
and they say, "I thought you knew something about plants.
I mean, don't you know anything?" And I said, "No."
Well, it turns out you take each of the 17 varieties
in the night of a full moon, and it sings to you in a different key.
Now, that's not going to get you a Ph.D. at Harvard,
but it's a lot more interesting than counting stamens. (Laughter)
(Applause) --
the problem -- the problem is that even those of us
sympathetic with the plight of indigenous people
view them as quaint and colorful
but somehow reduced to the margins of history
as the real world, meaning our world, moves on.
Well, the truth is the 20th century, 300 years from now,
is not going to be remembered for its wars
or its technological innovations,
but rather as the era in which we stood by
and either actively endorsed or passively accepted
the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity
on the planet. Now, the problem isn't change.
All cultures through all time
have constantly been engaged in a dance
with new possibilities of life.
The Sioux Indians did not stop being Sioux
when they gave up the bow and arrow
any more than an American stopped being an American
when he gave up the horse and buggy.
It's not change or technology
that threatens the integrity of the ethnosphere. It is power,
the crude face of domination.
Wherever you look around the world,
you discover that these are not cultures destined to fade away;
these are dynamic living peoples
being driven out of existence by identifiable forces
that are beyond their capacity to adapt to:
whether it's the egregious deforestation
in the homeland of the Penan --
a nomadic people from Southeast Asia, from Sarawak --
a people who lived free in the forest until a generation ago,
and now have all been reduced to servitude and prostitution
on the banks of the rivers,
where you can see the river itself is soiled with the silt
that seems to be carrying half of Borneo away
to the South China Sea,
where the Japanese freighters hang light in the horizon
ready to fill their holds with raw logs ripped from the forest --
or, in the case of the Yanomami,
it's the disease entities that have come in,
in the wake of the discovery of gold.
where I'm doing a lot of research recently,
you'll see it's a crude face of political domination.
You know, genocide, the physical extinction of a people
is universally condemned, but ethnocide,
the destruction of people's way of life, is not only not condemned,
it's universally, in many quarters, celebrated
as part of a development strategy.
And you cannot understand the pain of Tibet
until you move through it at the ground level.
I once travelled 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Western China
overland through southeastern Tibet to Lhasa
with a young colleague, and it was only when I got to Lhasa
that I understood the face behind the statistics
you hear about:
6,000 sacred monuments torn apart to dust and ashes,
1.2 million people killed by the cadres
during the Cultural Revolution.
This young man's father had been ascribed to the Panchen Lama.
That meant he was instantly killed
at the time of the Chinese invasion.
His uncle fled with His Holiness in the Diaspora
that took the people to Nepal.
His mother was incarcerated
for the crime of being wealthy.
He was smuggled into the jail at the age of two
to hide beneath her skirt tails
because she couldn't bear to be without him.
The sister who had done that brave deed
was put into an education camp.
One day she inadvertently stepped on an armband
of Mao, and for that transgression,
she was given seven years of hard labor.
The pain of Tibet can be impossible to bear,
but the redemptive spirit of the people is something to behold.
do we want to live in a monochromatic world of monotony
or do we want to embrace a polychromatic world of diversity?
Margaret Mead, the great anthropologist, said, before she died,
that her greatest fear was that as we drifted towards
this blandly amorphous generic world view
not only would we see the entire range of the human imagination
reduced to a more narrow modality of thought,
but that we would wake from a dream one day
having forgotten there were even other possibilities.
been around for [150,000] years.
The Neolithic Revolution -- which gave us agriculture,
at which time we succumbed to the cult of the seed;
the poetry of the shaman was displaced
by the prose of the priesthood;
we created hierarchy specialization surplus --
is only 10,000 years ago.
The modern industrial world as we know it
is barely 300 years old.
Now, that shallow history doesn't suggest to me
that we have all the answers for all of the challenges
that will confront us in the ensuing millennia.
When these myriad cultures of the world
are asked the meaning of being human,
they respond with 10,000 different voices.
of being what we are: a fully conscious species,
fully aware of ensuring that all peoples and all gardens
find a way to flourish. And there are great moments of optimism.
when I went narwhal hunting with some Inuit people,
and this man, Olayuk, told me a marvelous story of his grandfather.
The Canadian government has not always been kind
to the Inuit people, and during the 1950s,
to establish our sovereignty, we forced them into settlements.
This old man's grandfather refused to go.
The family, fearful for his life, took away all of his weapons,
all of his tools.
Now, you must understand that the Inuit did not fear the cold;
they took advantage of it.
The runners of their sleds were originally made of fish
wrapped in caribou hide.
So, this man's grandfather was not intimidated by the Arctic night
or the blizzard that was blowing.
He simply slipped outside, pulled down his sealskin trousers
and defecated into his hand. And as the feces began to freeze,
he shaped it into the form of a blade.
He put a spray of saliva on the edge of the shit knife
and as it finally froze solid, he butchered a dog with it.
He skinned the dog and improvised a harness,
took the ribcage of the dog and improvised a sled,
harnessed up an adjacent dog,
and disappeared over the ice floes, shit knife in belt.
Talk about getting by with nothing. (Laughter)
(Applause) --
is a symbol of the resilience of the Inuit people
and of all indigenous people around the world.
The Canadian government in April of 1999
gave back to total control of the Inuit
an area of land larger than California and Texas put together.
It's our new homeland. It's called Nunavut.
It's an independent territory. They control all mineral resources.
An amazing example of how a nation-state
can seek restitution with its people.
at least to all of all us who've traveled
in these remote reaches of the planet,
to realize that they're not remote at all.
They're homelands of somebody.
They represent branches of the human imagination
that go back to the dawn of time. And for all of us,
the dreams of these children, like the dreams of our own children,
become part of the naked geography of hope.
is, we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything.
We think that polemics --
(Applause) --
we think that polemics are not persuasive,
but we think that storytelling can change the world,
and so we are probably the best storytelling institution
in the world. We get 35 million hits on our website every month.
156 nations carry our television channel.
Our magazines are read by millions.
And what we're doing is a series of journeys
to the ethnosphere where we're going to take our audience
to places of such cultural wonder
that they cannot help but come away dazzled
by what they have seen, and hopefully, therefore,
embrace gradually, one by one,
the central revelation of anthropology:
that this world deserves to exist in a diverse way,
that we can find a way to live
in a truly multicultural, pluralistic world
where all of the wisdom of all peoples
can contribute to our collective well-being.
(Applause)
Thank you. I have to tell you I'm both challenged and excited.
My challenge is: the shortest seminar I usually do is 50 hours.
What is it that drives you in your life today? Not 10 years ago.
Are you running the same pattern?
All of us here have great minds.
We all know how to think.
What in their performance?"
and they were ahead by five strokes
psychologically, sexually, spiritually, emotionally abused --
and not always, but often,
they become some of the people that contribute the most to society.
What is it that shapes us?
because you can know something intellectually
and then not use it, not apply it.
When you ask people,
What do they tell you?
but that is not the defining factor.
there were emotions that blocked people's ability
but you're creative and determined, you find the way.
and that meaning produces emotion.
An emotion creates what we're going to do, or the action.
The history of our world is these decisions.
"You've got testicular cancer."
We all have had times,
Your model of the world is the filter. That's what's shaping us.
First, what's your target? What are you after?
It's not your desires.
You can get your desires or goals.
Second, once you know what the target that's driving you is
and you uncover it for the truth -- you don't form it --
There's the fuel you pick. So very quickly, six needs.
And if you got totally certain, ironically,
even though we need that --
gave us a second human need, which is uncertainty.
The ones you don't want, you call problems, but you need them.
You're certain it's good because you read or saw it before,
We all need to feel important, special, unique.
You can get it by making more money or being more spiritual.
How certain am I that you're going to respond to me? 10.
And this is where fulfillment comes.
But number five, you must grow.
if you're not growing,
doesn't matter how much money or friends you have,
And that calling can touch other people.
What does it mean? I'm worthless.
I set focus on "There's food." What a concept!

When I finished that night, she called him and left a message
at the top of the World Trade Center where he worked, saying,
She was asleep, because it was 3 a.m. for us, when he called her back,
I'd love to hold your hand and say I'm sorry,
if you didn't lose somebody today,
your focus is going to be how to serve somebody else.
I asked, "Do you always get angry?"
instead of my verbalization,
because that's what's going to fill you up.
we have already witnessed an ongoing genocide in Darfur
and the daily horrors of Iraq.
This has led to a common understanding of our situation,

The decline of violence is a fractal phenomenon.

One sees it all over the world, although not homogeneously.
It's especially evident in the West,
without permanent settlements or government.
And this is the state that's commonly thought to be one of primordial harmony.
If the death rate in tribal warfare had prevailed during the 20th century,
such as the following, from Numbers 31:
"And they warred against the Midianites as the Lord commanded Moses,
Now, although we don't have statistics for warfare
were routine forms of criminal punishment.
There were numerous ingenious forms of sadistic capital punishment:
Slavery, of course, was the preferred labor-saving device,
and cruelty was a popular form of entertainment.
Perhaps the most vivid example was the practice of cat burning,
in which a cat was hoisted on a stage and lowered in a sling into a fire,
for homicide rates in any village, hamlet, town, county that he could find,
which was approximately the rate of homicide in the Middle Ages,
Then, there is a slight uptick in the 1960s.
The people who said that rock and roll would lead to the decline of moral values
actually had a grain of truth to that.

as horrific as it is.
Even in the year scale, one can see a decline of violence.
This is from the FBI uniform crime statistics.
You can see that there's a fairly low rate of violence in the '50s and the '60s,
so that it went back to the level that was last enjoyed in 1960.
President Clinton, if you're here: thank you.
I think there are a number of reasons.
One of them is we have better reporting.
than 16th-century monks were.
We cognitive psychologists know
the higher the probability that you assign to it.
There are dynamics in the opinion and advocacy markets;
no one ever attracted advocates and donors
by saying, "Things just seem to be getting better and better."
And, of course, our change in standards can outpace the change in behavior.
That's a process that seems to be continuing,
So today, we get exercised -- and rightly so --
if a handful of murderers get executed by lethal injection in Texas
after a 15-year appeal process.
We don't consider that a couple of hundred years ago,

Being a good American, he has a pistol in the nightstand,
pulls out his gun, walks down the stairs.
And what does he see but a burglar with a gun in his hand?
Now, each one of them is thinking,
"I don't really want to kill that guy, but he's about to kill me.

You don't strike first, but you have a publicly announced policy
and therefore can only work if it's credible.
Life becomes an episode of "The Sopranos."

That would remove the temptation to invade preemptively

there is a widespread sentiment that life is cheap.
one puts a higher value on life in general.
This was an argument from the political scientist James Payne.
and was worked out in the book "Nonzero" by the journalist Robert Wright.
Wright points out that, in certain circumstances,

The result is that other people become more valuable alive than dead,

We think in abstract terms, we think in movement.
Secondly, intelligence is dynamic.
as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations,
intelligence is wonderfully interactive.

Al Gore spoke the other night
of the richness of human capacity.
on which we're educating our children.
and that we avert some of the scenarios that we've talked about.
for the richness they are
and seeing our children for the hope that they are.
Philosophers, dramatists, theologians
have grappled with this question for centuries:
what makes people go wrong?
as all kids are who grew up in an inner city.
And I had friends who were really good kids,
Some got killed, and some did it without drug assistance.
which privileged people like to think is fixed and impermeable,
with them on the good side, the others on the bad side --
I knew that line was movable, and it was permeable.
what appears is the demons, the devils in the world.
That tells us several things.
because good and evil is the yin and yang of the human condition.
It tells me something else.
If you remember, God's favorite angel was Lucifer.
It also means "the morning star," in some scripture.
to hurt people physically, to destroy people mortally, or ideas,
and to commit crimes against humanity.
If you Google "evil," a word that should surely have withered by now,
you come up with 136 million hits in a third of a second.

when I was the prison superintendent of the Stanford Prison Study.
My hypothesis is, American soldiers are good, usually.
Maybe it was the barrel that was bad.
But how am I going to deal with that hypothesis?
And thirdly, I had access to all of the 1,000 pictures
that these soldiers took.
These pictures are of a violent or sexual nature.
All of them come from the cameras of American soldiers.
give them permission to break the will of the enemy,
to prepare them for interrogation, to soften them up,
Those are the euphemisms, and this is how it was interpreted.
Let's go down to that dungeon.
with Leonardo da Vinci's ode to humanity
if you believe that they were good soldiers
Social psychologists like me come along and say,
"Yeah, people are the actors on the stage,
around the individual -- the bad barrel?
So Dr. Z's "Lucifer Effect," although it focuses on evil,
"I'm neither a good cop nor a bad cop, Jerome.
Like yourself, I'm a complex amalgam

You should notice here, when it gets up to 375,
When it gets up to here, there's "XXX" -- the pornography of power.
So Milgram is quantifying evil as the willingness of people
to blindly obey authority, to go all the way to 450 volts.

Thank you very much, Chris. Everybody who came up here
said they were scared. I don't know if I'm scared,
but this is my first time of addressing an audience like this.
And I don't have any smart technology for you to look at.
There are no slides, so you'll just have to be content with me.
(Laughter)
and talk about a different Africa.
Already this morning there were some allusions to the Africa
that you hear about all the time: the Africa of HIV/AIDS,
the Africa of malaria, the Africa of poverty, the Africa of conflict,
and the Africa of disasters.
there's an Africa that you don't hear about very much.
And sometimes I'm puzzled, and I ask myself why.
This is the Africa that is changing, that Chris alluded to.
This is the Africa of opportunity.
This is the Africa where people want to take charge of
their own futures and their own destinies.
And this is the Africa where people are looking for partnerships
to do this. That's what I want to talk about today.
a story about that change in Africa.
On 15th of September 2005, Mr. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha,
a governor of one of the oil-rich states of Nigeria,
was arrested by the London Metropolitan Police on a visit to London.
He was arrested because there were transfers of eight million dollars
that went into some dormant accounts
that belonged to him and his family.
This arrest occurred because there was cooperation
between the London Metropolitan Police
and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission of Nigeria --
led by one of our most able and courageous people: Mr. Nuhu Ribadu.
Alamieyeseigha was arraigned in London.
Due to some slip-ups, he managed to escape dressed as a woman
and ran from London back to Nigeria where,
according to our constitution, those in office
as governors, president -- as in many countries --
have immunity and cannot be prosecuted. But what happened:
people were so outraged by this behavior that it was possible
for his state legislature to impeach him and get him out of office.
This is a story about the fact that people in Africa
are no longer willing to tolerate corruption from their leaders.
This is a story about the fact that people want their resources
managed properly for their good, and not taken out to places
where they'll benefit just a few of the elite.
And therefore, when you hear about the corrupt Africa --
corruption all the time -- I want you to know that the people
and the governments are trying hard to fight this
in some of the countries, and that some successes are emerging.
There's still a long way to go, but that there's a will there.
And that successes are being chalked up on this very important fight.
So when you hear about corruption,
don't just feel that nothing is being done about this --
that you can't operate in any African country
because of the overwhelming corruption. That is not the case.
There's a will to fight, and in many countries, that fight is ongoing
and is being won. In others, like mine,
where there has been a long history of dictatorship in Nigeria,
the fight is ongoing and we have a long way to go.
The results are showing:
independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations
show that in many instances the trend is downwards
in terms of corruption, and governance is improving.
A study by the Economic Commission for Africa showed
a clear trend upwards in governance in 28 African countries.
before I leave this area of governance.
That is that people talk about corruption, corruption.
All the time when they talk about it
you immediately think about Africa.
That's the image: African countries. But let me say this:
if Alams was able to export eight million dollars into an account in London --
if the other people who had taken money, estimated at
20 to 40 billion now of developing countries' monies
sitting abroad in the developed countries -- if they're able to do this,
what is that? Is that not corruption?
In this country, if you receive stolen goods, are you not prosecuted?
So when we talk about this kind of corruption, let us also think
about what is happening on the other side of the globe --
where the money's going and what can be done to stop it.
I'm working on an initiative now, along with the World Bank,
on asset recovery, trying to do what we can
to get the monies that have been taken abroad --
developing countries' moneys -- to get that sent back.
Because if we can get the 20 billion dollars sitting out there back,
it may be far more for some of these countries
than all the aid that is being put together.
(Applause)
Africans, after -- they're tired, we're tired
of being the subject of everybody's charity and care.
We are grateful, but we know that
we can take charge of our own destinies if we have the will to reform.
And what is happening in many African countries now is a realization
that no one can do it but us. We have to do it.
We can invite partners who can support us, but we have to start.
We have to reform our economies, change our leadership,
become more democratic, be more open to change and to information.
in one of the largest countries on the continent, Nigeria.
In fact, if you're not in Nigeria, you're not in Africa.
I want to tell you that.
(Laughter)
One in four sub-Saharan Africans is Nigerian,
and it has 140 million dynamic people -- chaotic people --
but very interesting people. You'll never be bored.
(Laughter)
that we had to take charge and reform ourselves.
And with the support of a leader
who was willing, at the time, to do the reforms,
we put forward a comprehensive reform program,
which we developed ourselves.
Not the International Monetary Fund. Not the World Bank,
where I worked for 21 years and rose to be a vice president.
No one can do it for you. You have to do it for yourself.
out of businesses it had nothing -- it had no business being in.
The state should not be in the business
of producing goods and services
because it's inefficient and incompetent.
So we decided to privatize many of our enterprises.
(Applause)
We -- as a result, we decided to liberalize many of our markets.
Can you believe that prior to this reform --
which started at the end of 2003, when I left Washington
to go and take up the post of Finance Minister --
we had a telecommunications company that was only able to develop
4,500 landlines in its entire 30-year history?
(Laughter)
You couldn't get it. You had to bribe.
You had to do everything to get your phone.
When President Obasanjo supported and launched
the liberalization of the telecommunications sector,
we went from 4,500 landlines to 32 million GSM lines, and counting.
Nigeria's telecoms market is the second-fastest growing in the world,
after China. We are getting investments of about a billion dollars a year
in telecoms. And nobody knows, except a few smart people.
(Laughter)
was the MTN company of South Africa.
And in the three years that I was Finance Minister,
they made an average of 360 million dollars profit per year.
360 million in a market -- in a country that is a poor country,
with an average per capita income just under 500 dollars per capita.
So the market is there.
When they kept this under wraps, but soon others got to know.
Nigerians themselves began to develop
some wireless telecommunications companies,
and three or four others have come in.
But there's a huge market out there,
and people don't know about it, or they don't want to know.
So privatization is one of the things we've done.
Because nobody's going to help you and support you
if you're not managing your own finances well.
And Nigeria, with the oil sector, had the reputation
of being corrupt and not managing its own public finances well.
So what did we try to do? We introduced a fiscal rule
that de-linked our budget from the oil price.
Before we used to just budget on whatever oil we bring in,
because oil is the biggest, most revenue-earning sector
in the economy: 70 percent of our revenues come from oil.
We de-linked that, and once we did it, we began to budget
at a price slightly lower than the oil price
and save whatever was above that price.
We didn't know we could pull it off; it was very controversial.
But what it immediately did was that the volatility
that had been present in terms of our economic development --
where, even if oil prices were high, we would grow very fast.
When they crashed, we crashed.
And we could hardly even pay anything, any salaries, in the economy.
That smoothened out. We were able to save, just before I left,
27 billion dollars. Whereas -- and this went to our reserves --
when I arrived in 2003, we had seven billion dollars in reserves.
By the time I left, we had gone up to almost 30 billion dollars. And
as we speak now, we have about 40 billion dollars in reserves
due to proper management of our finances.
And that shores up our economy, makes it stable.
is now fairly stable and being managed so that business people
have a predictability of prices in the economy.
We brought inflation down from 28 percent to about 11 percent.
And we had GDP grow from an average of 2.3 percent the previous decade
to about 6.5 percent now.
So all the changes and reforms we were able to make
have shown up in results that are measurable in the economy.
and diversify -- and there are so many opportunities
in this one big country, as in many countries in Africa --
what was remarkable is that much of this growth came
not from the oil sector alone, but from non-oil.
Agriculture grew at better than eight percent.
As telecoms sector grew, housing and construction,
and I could go on and on. And this is to illustrate to you that
once you get the macro-economy straightened out,
the opportunities in various other sectors are enormous.
We have opportunities in solid minerals. We have a lot of minerals
that no one has even invested in or explored. And we realized
that without the proper legislation to make that possible,
that wouldn't happen. So we've now got a mining code
that is comparable with some of the best in the world.
We have opportunities in housing and real estate.
There was nothing in a country of 140 million people --
no shopping malls as you know them here.
This was an investment opportunity for someone
that excited the imagination of people.
And now, we have a situation in which the businesses in this mall
are doing four times the turnover that they had projected.
mortgage markets. Financial services:
we had 89 banks. Too many not doing their real business.
We consolidated them from 89 to 25 banks by requiring
that they increase their capital -- share capital.
And it went from about 25 million dollars to 150 million dollars.
The banks -- these banks are now consolidated, and that strengthening
of the banking system has attracted a lot of investment from outside.
Barclays Bank of the U.K. is bringing in 500 million.
Standard Chartered has brought in 140 million.
And I can go on. Dollars, on and on, into the system.
So in financial services, a great deal of opportunity.
In tourism, in many African countries, a great opportunity.
And that's what many people know East Africa for:
the wildlife, the elephants, and so on.
But managing the tourism market in a way
that can really benefit the people is very important.
that there's a new wave on the continent.
A new wave of openness and democratization in which, since 2000,
more than two-thirds of African countries have had
multi-party democratic elections.
Not all of them have been perfect, or will be,
but the trend is very clear.
I'm trying to tell you that since the past three years,
the average rate of growth on the continent has moved
from about 2.5 percent to about five percent per annum.
This is better than the performance of many OECD countries.
So it's clear that things are changing.
from about 12 conflicts a decade ago,
we are down to three or four conflicts --
one of the most terrible, of course, of which is Darfur.
And, you know, you have the neighborhood effect where
if something is going on in one part of the continent,
it looks like the entire continent is affected.
But you should know that this continent is not --
is a continent of many countries, not one country.
And if we are down to three or four conflicts,
it means that there are plenty of opportunities to invest
in stable, growing, exciting economies
where there's plenty of opportunity.
And I want to just make one point about this investment.
is to help them to stand on their own feet.
And the best way to do that is by helping create jobs.
There's no issue with fighting malaria and putting money in that
and saving children's lives. That's not what I'm saying. That is fine.
But imagine the impact on a family: if the parents can be employed
and make sure that their children go to school,
that they can buy the drugs to fight the disease themselves.
If we can invest in places where you yourselves make money
whilst creating jobs and helping people stand on their own feet,
isn't that a wonderful opportunity? Isn't that the way to go?
And I want to say that some of the best people to invest in
on the continent are the women.
(Applause)
Otherwise, I would have liked you to have seen this.
It says, "Africa: Open for Business."
And this is a video that has actually won an award
as the best documentary of the year.
Understand that the woman who made it
is going to be in Tanzania, where they're having the session in June.
But it shows you Africans, and particularly African women, who
against all odds have developed businesses, some of them world-class.
making children's clothes --
which she started as a hobby and grew into a business.
Mixing African materials, such as we have,
with materials from elsewhere.
So, she'll make a little pair of dungarees with corduroys,
with African material mixed in. Very creative designs,
has reached a stage where she even had an order from Wal-Mart.
(Laughter)
For 10,000 pieces.
So that shows you that we have people who are capable of doing.
I could go on giving examples:
Beatrice Gakuba of Rwanda, who opened up a flower business
and is now exporting to the Dutch auction in Amsterdam each morning
and is employing 200 other women and men to work with her.
However, many of these are starved for capital to expand,
because nobody believes outside of our countries
that we can do what is necessary. Nobody thinks in terms of a market.
Nobody thinks there's opportunity.
But I'm standing here saying that those who miss the boat now,
will miss it forever.
Think about the Beatrices, think about the Adenikes of this world,
who are doing incredible things, that are bringing them
into the global economy, whilst at the same time making sure
that their fellow men and women are employed,
and that the children in those households get educated
because their parents are earning adequate income.
When you go to Tanzania, listen carefully,
because I'm sure you will hear of the various openings that there will be
for you to get involved in something that will do good
for the continent, for the people and for yourselves.
(Applause)
This is very strange for me, because I’m not used to doing this:
I usually stand on the other side of the light,
and now I'm feeling the pressure I put other people into. And it's hard ...
The previous speaker has, I think,
really painted a very good background as to
the impulse behind my work and what drives me, and my sense of loss,
and trying to find the answer to the big questions.
feels like -- there’s this sculptor that I like very much, Giacometti,
who after many years of living in France -- and learning, you know,
studying and working -- he returned home and he was asked, what did you produce?
What have you done with so many years of being away?
And he sort of, he showed a handful of figurines.
And obviously they were, "Is this what you spent years doing?
And we expected huge masterpieces!"
But what struck me is the understanding that in those little pieces
was the culmination of a man’s life, search, thought, everything --
just in a reduced, small version.
In a way, I feel like that.
I feel like I’m coming home to talk about
what I’ve been away doing for 20 years.
And I will start with a brief taster of what I’ve been about:
a handful of films -- nothing much,
two feature films and a handful of short films.
So, we’ll go with the first piece.
I love her, you know.
She’s not even my real mum.
My real mum and dad dumped me
and fucked off back to Nigeria.
The devil is in me, Court.
Court: Sleep.
Woman: Have you ever been?
Court: Where?
Woman: Nigeria.
Court: Never.
My mum wanted to,
couldn’t afford it.
Woman: Wish I could.
I have this feeling I’d be happy there.
Why does everyone get rid of me?
Court: I don't want to get rid of you.
Woman: You don't need me.
You’re just too blind to see it now.
Marcus: Read.
Boy: Don't you get bored?
And how come you ain't got a job anyway?
Marcus: I am retired.
Boy: So?
Marcus: So I've done my bit for Queen and country, now I work for myself.
Boy: No, now you sit around like a bum all day.
Marcus: Because I do what I like?
Boy: Look man, reading don't feed no one.
And it particularly don't feed your spliff habit.
Marcus: It feeds my mind and my soul.
Boy: Arguing with you is a waste of time, Marcus.
Marcus: You’re a rapper, am I right?
Boy: Yeah.
Marcus: A modern day poet.
Boy: Yeah, you could say that.
Marcus: So what do you talk about?
Boy: What's that supposed to mean?
Marcus: Simple. What do you rap about?
Boy: Reality, man.
Marcus: Whose reality?
Boy: My fuckin' reality.
Marcus: Tell me about your reality.
Boy: Racism, oppression, people like me not getting a break in life.
Marcus: So what solutions do you offer? I mean, the job of a poet is not just --
Boy: Man, fight the power! Simple: blow the motherfuckers out of the sky.
Marcus: With an AK-47?
Boy: Man, if I had one, too fuckin' right.
Marcus: And how many soldiers have you recruited to fight this war with you?
Boy: Oh, Marcus, you know what I mean.
Marcus: When a man resorts to profanities,
it’s a sure sign of his inability to express himself.
Boy: See man, you’re just taking the piss out of me now.
Marcus: The Panthers.
Boy: Panthers?
Ass kickin' guys who were fed up with all that white supremacist, powers-that-be bullshit,
and just went in there and kicked everybody's arse.
Fuckin’ wicked, man. I saw the movie. Bad! What?
Épuise, right?
Woman 1: Yes.
D1: Not to make a bad joke, but it was really épuisé.
Epuisé -- tired, exhausted, fed up.
Director 2: Can you not shut up?
Now, you talk straight to me, what’s wrong with my films?
Let’s go.
W1: They suck.
Woman 2: They suck? What about yours?
What, what, what, what about, what?
What do you think about your movie?
D1: My movies, they are OK, fine.
They are better than making documentaries no one ever sees.
What the fuck are you talking about?
Did you ever move your fuckin' ass from Hollywood
to go and film something real?
You make people fuckin' sleep.
Dream about bullshit.
totally trying to capture what cinema is for me,
and where I'm coming from in terms of cinema.
The first piece was, really, there's a young woman talking about Nigeria,
that she has a feeling she'll be happy there.
These are the sentiments of someone that's been away from home.
And that was something that I went through, you know, and I'm still going through.
I've not been home for quite a while, for about five years now.
I've been away 20 years in total.
And so it’s really --
it's really how suddenly, you know, this was made in 1997,
which is the time of Abacha -- the military dictatorship,
the worst part of Nigerian history, this post-colonial history.
So, for this girl to have these dreams
is simply how we preserve a sense of what home is.
How -- and it's sort of, perhaps romantic, but I think beautiful,
because you just need something to hold on to,
especially in a society where you feel alienated.
talks about lack of opportunity: living as a black person in Europe,
the glass ceiling that we all know about, that we all talk about,
and his reality.
Again, this was my -- this was me talking about --
this was, again, the time of multiculturalism in the United Kingdom,
and there was this buzzword -- and it was trying to say,
what exactly does this multiculturalism mean in the real lives of people?
And what would a child --
what does a child like Jamie -- the young boy -- think,
I mean, with all this anger that's built up inside of him?
What happens with that?
What, of course, happens with that is violence,
which we see when we talk about the ghettos
and we talk about, you know, South Central L.A. and this kind of stuff,
and which eventually, when channeled, becomes,
you know, evolves and manifests itself as riots --
like the one in France two years ago, where I live,
which shocked everybody, because everyone thought, "Oh well,
France is a liberal society."
But I lived in England for 18 years.
I've lived in France for about four, and I feel actually
thrown back 20 years, living in France.
And then, the third piece. The third piece for me is the question:
What is cinema to you? What do you do with cinema?
There's a young director, Hollywood director, with his friends --
fellow filmmakers -- talking about what cinema means.
I suppose that will take me to my last piece --
what cinema means for me.
My life started as a -- I started life in 1966,
a few months before the Biafran, which lasted for three years
and it was three years of war.
So that whole thing,
that whole childhood echoes and takes me into the next piece.
Onicha: Yes, mama.
Commander: Soldiers, you are going to fight a battle,
so you must get ready and willing to die.
You must get -- ?
Child Soldiers: Ready and willing to die.
C: Success, the change is only coming through the barrel of the gun.
CS: The barrel of the gun!
C: This is the gun.
CS: This is the gun.
C: This is an AK-47 rifle. This is your life.
This is your life. This is ... this is ... this is your life.
Ezra: They give us the special drugs. We call it bubbles.
Amphetamines.
Soldiers: Rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
I say rain come, sun come, soldier man dey go.
We went from one village to another -- three villages.
I don’t remember how we got there.
Witness: We walked and walked for two days.
We didn't eat.
There was no food, just little rice.
Without food -- I was sick.
The injection made us not to have mind.
God will forgive us.
He knows we did not know. We did not know!
Ezra: I don’t remember.
Onicha: Ezra! (Ezra: Onicha! Onicha!)
Various Voices: ♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫
♫ No more trouble ♫
They killed my mother.
The Mende sons of bastards.
(Shouting)
Who is she?
Me.
Why you giving these to me?
So you can stop staring at me.
My story is a little bit complicated.
I’m interested.
Mariam is pregnant.
You know what you are? A crocodile.
Big mouth. Short legs.
In front of Rufus you are Ezra the coward.
He’s not taking care of his troops.
Troop, pay your last honor. Salute.
Open your eyes, Ezra.
A blind man can see that the diamonds end up in his pocket.
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫
Get that idiot out!
I take you are preparing a major attack?
This must be the mine.
Your girl is here.
Well done, well done.
That is what you are here for, no?
You are planning to go back to fight are you?
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫
♫ No more trouble ♫
♫ We don't need no more trouble ♫
♫ No more trouble. ♫
Wake up! Everybody wake up. Road block!
♫ We don't need no more ... ♫
will go a long way towards understanding the causes of the rebel war.
More than that, begin a healing process and finally to --
as an act of closure to a terrible period in this country’s history.
The beginning of hope.
Mr. Ezra Gelehun, please stand.
State your name and age for the commission.
Ezra: My name is Ezra Gelehun.
I am 15 or 16. I don’t remember.
Ask my sister, she is the witch, she knows everything.
(Sister: 16.)
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I’d like to remind you you’re not on trial here
for any crimes you committed.
E: We were fighting for our freedom.
If killing in a war is a crime,
then you have to charge every soldier in the world.
War is a crime, yes, but I did not start it.
You too are a retired General, not so?
CC: Yes, correct.
E: So you too must stand trial then.
Our government was corrupt.
Lack of education was their way to control power.
If I may ask, do you pay for school in your country?
CC: No, we don’t.
E: You are richer than us.
But we pay for school.
Your country talks about democracy,
but you support corrupt governments like my own.
Why? Because you want our diamond.
Ask if anyone in this room have ever seen real diamond before?
No.
CC: Mr. Gelehun, I'd like to remind you, you're not on trial here today.
You are not on trial.
E: Then let me go.
CC: I can't do that, son.
E: So you are a liar.
is that while we’re making all these huge advancements,
what we're doing, which for me, you know, I think we should --
Africa should move forward, but we should remember,
so we do not go back here again.
Thank you.
in the piece we just watched is this sense of the psychological trauma of the young
that have to play this role of being child soldiers.
And considering where you are coming from,
and when we consider the extent to which it’s not taken as seriously
as it should be, what would you have to say about that?
a bit of time in Sierra Leone researching this.
And I remember I met a lot of child soldiers --
ex-combatants, as they like to be called.
I met psychosocial workers who worked with them.
I met psychiatrists who spent time with them,
aid workers, NGOs, the whole lot.
But I remember on the flight back on my last trip,
I remember breaking down in tears and thinking to myself,
if any kid in the West, in the western world,
went through a day of what any of those kids have gone through,
they will be in therapy for the rest of their natural lives.
So for me, the thought that we have all these children --
it’s a generation, we have a whole generation of children --
who have been put through so much psychological trauma or damage,
and Africa has to live with that.
But I’m just saying to factor that in,
factor that in with all this great advancement,
all this pronouncement of great achievement.
That’s really my thinking.
That was a very moving piece.
Well, this is such an honor. And it's wonderful to be
in the presence of an organization that is really making a difference in the world.
the last thing I ever wanted to do was write, or be in any way involved in religion.
After I left my convent, I'd finished with religion, frankly.
I thought that was it.
And for 13 years I kept clear of it. I wanted to be an English literature professor.
And I certainly didn't even want to be a writer, particularly.
But then I suffered a series of career catastrophes,
one after the other, and finally found myself in television. (Laughter)
I said that to Bill Moyers, and he said, "Oh, we take anybody." (Laughter)
This went down very well in the U.K., where religion is extremely unpopular.
And so, for once, for the only time in my life, I was finally in the mainstream.
But I got sent to Jerusalem to make a film about early Christianity.
And there, for the first time, I encountered the other religious traditions:
Judaism and Islam, the sister religions of Christianity.
And while I found I knew nothing about these faiths at all --
despite my own intensely religious background,
I'd seen Judaism only as a kind of prelude to Christianity,
and I knew nothing about Islam at all.
where you see the three faiths jostling so uneasily together,
you also become aware of the profound connection between them.
And it has been the study of other religious traditions that brought me back
to a sense of what religion can be, and actually enabled me
to look at my own faith in a different light.
that had never occurred to me. Frankly, in the days when I thought I'd had it with religion,
I just found the whole thing absolutely incredible.
These doctrines seemed unproven, abstract.
And to my astonishment, when I began seriously studying other traditions,
I began to realize that belief -- which we make such a fuss about today --
is only a very recent religious enthusiasm
that surfaced only in the West, in about the 17th century.
The word "belief" itself originally meant to love, to prize, to hold dear.
In the 17th century, it narrowed its focus,
for reasons that I'm exploring in a book I'm writing at the moment,
to include -- to mean an intellectual assent to a set of propositions, a credo.
"I believe:" it did not mean, "I accept certain creedal articles of faith."
It meant: "I commit myself. I engage myself."
In the Quran, religious opinion -- religious orthodoxy -- is dismissed as "zanna:"
self-indulgent guesswork about matters that nobody can be certain of one way or the other,
but which makes people quarrelsome and stupidly sectarian. (Laughter)
What I've found, across the board, is that religion is about behaving differently.
Instead of deciding whether or not you believe in God, first you do something.
You behave in a committed way,
and then you begin to understand the truths of religion.
And religious doctrines are meant to be summons to action;
you only understand them when you put them into practice.
And it is an arresting fact that right across the board,
in every single one of the major world faiths, compassion --
the ability to feel with the other in the way we've been thinking about this evening --
is not only the test of any true religiosity, it is also what will bring us
into the presence of what Jews, Christians and Muslims call "God" or the "Divine."
It is compassion, says the Buddha, which brings you to Nirvana.
Why? Because in compassion, when we feel with the other,
we dethrone ourselves from the center of our world and we put
another person there. And once we get rid of ego, then we're ready to see the Divine.
and put at the core of their tradition what's become known as the Golden Rule.
First propounded by Confucius five centuries before Christ:
"Do not do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
That, he said, was the central thread which ran through all his teaching
and that his disciples should put into practice all day and every day.
And it was -- the Golden Rule would bring them to the transcendent value that he called "ren,"
human-heartedness, which was a transcendent experience in itself.
There's a famous story about the great rabbi, Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus.
A pagan came to him and offered to convert to Judaism if the rabbi could
recite the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg.
Hillel stood on one leg and said, "That which is hateful to you,
do not do to your neighbor. That is the Torah. The rest is commentary.
Go and study it." (Laughter)
He said, "In your exegesis, you must make it clear
that every single verse of the Torah is a commentary, a gloss upon the Golden Rule."
The great Rabbi Meir said that any interpretation of Scripture which
led to hatred and disdain, or contempt of other people --
any people whatsoever -- was illegitimate.
Scripture, he says, "teaches nothing but charity, and we must not leave
an interpretation of Scripture until we have found a compassionate interpretation of it."
And this struggle to find compassion in some of these rather rebarbative texts
is a good dress rehearsal for doing the same in ordinary life. (Applause)
where religion has been hijacked. Where terrorists cite Quranic verses to justify their atrocities.
Don't judge others," we have the spectacle of Christians endlessly judging other people,
endlessly using Scripture as a way of arguing with other people,
putting other people down. Throughout the ages, religion has been used to oppress others,
and this is because of human ego, human greed.
We have a talent as a species for messing up wonderful things.
that you could not and must not confine your compassion
to your own group: your own nation, your own co-religionists,
your own fellow countrymen. You must have what one of the Chinese sages called "jian ai":
concern for everybody. Love your enemies. Honor the stranger.
We formed you, says the Quran, into tribes and nations so that you may know one another.
abuse of religion -- for nefarious gains.
Now, I've lost count of the number of taxi drivers who,
when I say to them what I do for a living, inform me that religion
has been the cause of all the major world wars in history. Wrong.
The causes of our present woes are political.
and when a conflict gets ingrained in a region, religion can get sucked in
and become part of the problem. Our modernity has been exceedingly violent.
Between 1914 and 1945, 70 million people died in Europe alone as a result of armed conflict.
And so many of our institutions, even football, which used to be a pleasant pastime,
now causes riots where people even die.
And it's not surprising that religion, too, has been affected by this violent ethos.
People seem to think, now equate religious faith with believing things.
As though that -- we call religious people often believers,
as though that were the main thing that they do. And very often, secondary goals
get pushed into the first place, in place of compassion and the Golden Rule.
Because the Golden Rule is difficult. I sometimes -- when I'm speaking to
congregations about compassion, I sometimes see
a mutinous expression crossing some of their faces because
a lot of religious people prefer to be right, rather than compassionate. (Laughter)
Since September the 11th, when my work on Islam suddenly propelled me
into public life, in a way that I'd never imagined, I've been able to sort of go all over the world,
and finding, everywhere I go, a yearning for change.
I've just come back from Pakistan, where literally thousands of people came to my lectures,
because they were yearning, first of all, to hear a friendly Western voice.
And especially the young people were coming. And were asking me --
the young people were saying, "What can we do? What can we do to change things?"
And my hosts in Pakistan said, "Look, don't be too polite to us.
Tell us where we're going wrong. Let's talk together about where religion is failing."
at the moment that any ideology that doesn't promote a sense of global understanding
and global appreciation of each other is failing the test of the time.
And religion, with its wide following ... Here in the United States,
people may be being religious in a different way, as a report has just shown --
but they still want to be religious. It's only Western Europe that has retained its secularism,
which is now beginning to look rather endearingly old-fashioned.
to be a force for harmony in the world, which it can and should be --
because of the Golden Rule.
"Do not do to others what you would not have them do to you":
an ethos that should now be applied globally.
We should not treat other nations as we would not wish to be treated ourselves.
It's a profound moral matter that engages and should engage us all.
And as I say, there is a hunger for change out there.
Here in the United States, I think you see it in this election campaign: a longing for change.
And people in churches all over and mosques all over this continent after September the 11th,
coming together locally to create networks of understanding.
With the mosque, with the synagogue, saying, "We must start to speak to one another."
I think it's time that we moved beyond the idea of toleration and move toward appreciation of the other.
This comes from "The Iliad." But it tells you what this spirituality should be.
You know the story of "The Iliad," the 10-year war between Greece and Troy.
In one incident, Achilles, the famous warrior of Greece, takes his troops out of the war,
and the whole war effort suffers. And in the course of the ensuing muddle,
his beloved friend, Patroclus, is killed -- and killed in single combat
by one of the Trojan princes, Hector. And Achilles goes mad with grief and rage and revenge,
and then he refuses to give the body back for burial to the family,
which means that, in Greek ethos, Hector's soul will wander eternally, lost.
And then one night, Priam, king of Troy, an old man,
these traditions now so often at loggerheads -- working together to
create a document which we hope will be signed by a thousand, at least,
of major religious leaders from all the traditions of the world.
you're the people with media knowledge to explain to me how we can get this to everybody,
as it were, from the United Nations, from the world --
I think the future of this planet depends on humans,
not technology, and we already have the knowledge --
we’re kind of at the endgame with knowledge.
But we’re nowhere near the endgame
when it comes to our perception.
We still have one foot in the dark ages.
And when you listen to some of the presentations here --
and the extraordinary range of human capability, our understandings --
and then you contrast it with the fact
we still call this planet, "Earth:" it’s pretty extraordinary --
we have one foot in the dark ages.
Galileo -- he had the Inquisition, so he had to be a little bit more polite --
his was, "It’s not in the middle, you know."
And Hawkes: "it’s not earth, stupid, it’s ocean."
This is an ocean planet.
T.S. Eliot really said it for me --
and this should give you goose bumps:
"we shall not cease from exploration
and the end of our exploring shall be to return
where we started and know the place for the first time."
And the next lines are, "Through the unknown remembered gate,
where the last of earth discovered
is that which is the beginning."
So I have one message.
It seems to me that we’re all pointed in the wrong direction.
I love what you’re doing, I admire the guts,
I admire the courage -- but your rockets
are pointed in the wrong goddamn direction.
(Laughter)
And it’s all a question of perspective.
Let me try and tell you --
I don’t mean to insult you, but look,
if I -- and I’m not doing this for real
because it would be an insult,
so I’m going to pretend, and it softens the blow --
I’m going to tell you what you’re thinking.
If I held up a square that was one foot square and the color of earth,
and I held up another square that was the root two square --
so it’s 1.5 times bigger -- and was the color of the oceans;
and I said, what is the relative value of these two things?
Well, it’s the relative importance.
You would say -- yeah, yeah, yeah, we all know this;
water covers twice the area of the planet than dry land.
But it’s a question of perception,
and if that’s what you’re thinking,
if that’s what you think I mean when I say,
"This is an ocean planet stupidly called 'Earth.'"
If you think that that’s the relative importance,
two to one, you’re wrong by a factor of ten.
Now, you’re not as thick as two short planks,
but you sound like it when you say "Earth,"
because that demonstration, if I turned around this way --
that earth plane would be as thin as paper.
It’s a thin film, two-dimensional existence.
The ocean representation would have a depth to it.
And if you hefted those two things
you might find that the relative scale of those is 20 to 1.
94 percent of life on earth is aquatic.
That means that us terrestrials occupy a minority.
The problem we have in believing that
is -- you just have to give up this notion
that this Earth was created for us.
Because it’s a problem we have.
If this is an ocean planet
and we only have a small minority of this planet,
it just interferes with a lot of what humanity thinks.
I’m not talking about James Cameron --
although I could, but I won’t.
You really do have to go and see his latest film,
"Aliens of the Deep." It’s incredible.
It features two of these deep rovers,
and I can criticize them because these sweet things are mine.
This, I think, represents one of the most beautiful
classic submersibles built.
If you look at that sub, you’ll see a sphere.
This is an acryclic sphere.
It generates all of the buoyancy,
all of the payload for the craft,
and the batteries are down here hanging underneath,
exactly like a balloon.
This is the envelope, and this is the gondola, the payload.
Also coming up later for criticism are these massive lights.
And this one actually carries two great manipulators.
It actually is a very good working sub --
that’s what it was designed for.
The problem with it is --
and the reason I will never build another one like it --
is that this is a product of two-dimensional thinking.
It’s what we humans do when we go in the ocean as engineers;
we take all our terrestrial hang-ups,
all our constraints -- importantly,
these two-dimensional constraints that we have,
and they’re so constrained we don’t even understand it --
and we take them underwater.
You notice that Jim Cameron is sitting in a seat.
A seat works in a two-dimensional world,
where gravity blasts down on that seat, OK?
And in a two-dimensional world,
we do know about the third dimension
but we don’t use it because to go up
requires an awful lot of energy against gravity.
And then our mothers tell us,
"Careful you don’t fall down" -- because you’ll fall over.
This planet has an inner atmosphere of water;
it’s its inner atmosphere. It has two atmospheres --
a lesser, outer gaseous atmosphere, a lighter one.
Most of life on earth is in that inner atmosphere.
And that life enjoys a three-dimensional existence,
which is alien to us.
Fish do not sit in seats.
(Laughter)
They don’t. Their mothers don’t say to little baby fish,
"Careful you don’t fall over."
They don’t fall over. They don’t fall.
They live in a three-dimensional world
where there is no difference in energy
between going this way, that way, that way or that way.
It’s truly a three-dimensional space.
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it.
I don’t know of any other submersible,
or even remote, that just takes advantage
that this is a three-dimensional space.
This is a three-dimensional machine.
What we need to do is go down into the ocean with the freedom of the animals,
and move in this three-dimensional space.
OK, this is good stuff.
This is man’s first attempt at flying underwater.
Right now, I’m just coming down on this gorgeous, big, giant manta ray.
She has twice the wingspan that I do.
There I’m coming; she sees me.
And just notice how she rolls under and turns;
she doesn’t sit there and try and blow air into a tank
and kind of flow up or sink down -- she just rolls.
And the craft that I’m in --
this hasn’t been shown before.
Chris asked us to show stuff that hasn’t been shown before.
I wanted you to notice
that she actually turned to come back up.
There I am; I see her coming back,
coming up underneath me.
I put reverse thrust and I try and pull gently down.
I’m trying to do everything very gently.
We spent about three hours together and she’s beginning to trust me.
And this ballet is controlled by this lady here.
She gets about that close and then she pulls away.
So now I try and go after her, but I’m practicing flying.
This is the first flying machine. This was the first prototype.
This was a fly by wire. It has wings.
There’re no silly buoyancy tanks --
it’s permanently, positively buoyant.
And then by moving through the water
it’s able to take that control.
Now, look at that; look, it’s -- she just blew me away.
She just rolled right away from underneath.
Really that’s the only real dive I’ve ever made in this machine.
But this lady here taught me, hah, taught me so much.
We just learned so much in three hours in the water there.
I just had to go and build another machine.
But look here. Instead of blowing tanks
and coming up slowly without thinking about it,
it’s a little bit of back pressure,
and that sub just comes straight back up out of the water.
I don’t really look that ugly,
but the camera is so close that it’s just distorted.
Now, there she goes, right overhead.
This is a wide-angle camera.
She’s just a few inches off the top of my head.
"Aah, ha, oh, he just crossed over the top of my head about,
oh, I don’t know, just so close."
I come back up, not for air.
"This is an incredible encounter with a manta. I’m speechless.
We’ve been just feet apart. I’m going back down now."
Okay, can we cut that? Lights back up please.
(Applause)
it wasn’t the lack of maneuverability that we had.
It was the fact she was going so slow.
I actually designed that to move faster through the water
because I thought that was the thing
that we needed to do: to move fast and get range.
But after that encounter I really did want to go back with that animal and dance.
She wanted to dance.
And so what we needed to do was increase the wing area
so that we just had more grip, develop higher forces.
You see the larger wing area here.
Also, clearly, it was such a powerful thing,
we wanted to try and bring other people
but we couldn't figure out how to do it.
So we opened the world’s first flight school.
The rational for the world’s first flight school
goes something like: when the coastguards come up to me and say --
they used to leave us alone when we were diving
these goofy little spherical things,
but when we started flying around
in underwater jet fighters they got a little nervous --
they would come up and say,
"Do you have a license for that?"
And then I’d put my sunglasses on, the beard
that would all sprout out, and I would say,
"I don’t need no stinking license."
(Laughter)
"I write these stinking license," which I do.
So Bob Gelfond's around here --
but somebody in the audience here has license number 20.
They’re one of the first subsea aviators.
So we’ve run two flight schools.
Where the hell that goes, I don’t know, but it’s a lot of fun.
What comes next in 30 seconds? I can’t tell you.
Karen and I, we were looking at it,
some business partners wanted us to patent it --
we weren’t sure about that.
We’ve decided we’re just going to let that go.
It just seems wrong to try and patent --
(Applause)
-- the freedom for underwater flight.
So anybody who wants to copy us
and come and join us, go for it.
The other thing is that we’ve got much lower costs.
We developed some other technology
called spider optics, and Craig Ventner asked me
to make an announcement here this morning:
we’re going to be building a beautiful, little,
small version of this -- unmanned, super deep --
for his boat to go and get back some deep sea DNA stuff.
(Applause)
Thank you.
We're going to go on a dive to the deep sea,
and anyone that's had that lovely opportunity
that you couldn't describe:
some they use to attract prey,
And a lot of what goes on inside --
There's a fish with glowing eyes, pulsating eyes.
Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize,
one of my favorites, this pinwheel design.
Just absolutely amazing, every single dive.
underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls --
a lot of that we shared with you from the stage.
And in a place where we thought no life at all,
Here's an octopus moving across the reef,
Now males, when they fight,
Now, here's a male on the left and a female on the right,
and the male has managed to split his coloration
white on the right, brown on the left.
but I don't know.
and watch his tentacles --
he just pulls them in, makes them look just like algae.
Positively amazing.
But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin.
That's an amazing thing.
Sometimes they don't want to be seen when they move,
because predators can see them.
and when he lands, the octopus says, "Oh, I've been seen.
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get."
So, he's bluffing. Let's do it backwards.
One, two, three.
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times.
I'm giving a short slide show this morning
that I'm giving for the very first time, so --
well it's -- I don't want or need to raise the bar,
I'm actually trying to lower the bar.
Because I've cobbled this together
to try to meet the challenge of this session.
that religion really properly understood
is not about belief, but about behavior.
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism.
How dare we be optimistic?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief, an intellectual posture.
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said,
"You must become the change you wish to see in the world."
And the outcome about which
we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created
by the belief alone, except to the extent that the belief
brings about new behavior. But the word "behavior"
is also, I think, sometimes misunderstood in this context.
I'm a big advocate of changing
the lightbulbs and buying hybrids,
and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house,
and dug the geothermal wells, and did all of that other stuff.
But, as important as it is to change the lightbulbs,
it is more important to change the laws.
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives,
we sometimes leave out the citizenship part
and the democracy part. In order to be optimistic about this,
we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy.
In order to solve the climate crisis,
we have to solve the democracy crisis.
And we have one.
I was reminded of that recently, by a woman
who walked past the table I was sitting at,
just staring at me as she walked past. She was in her 70s,
looked like she had a kind face. I thought nothing of it
until I saw from the corner of my eye
she was walking from the opposite direction,
also just staring at me. And so I said, "How do you do?"
And she said, "You know, if you dyed your hair black,
you would look just like Al Gore." (Laughter)
I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge
of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race.
And the military historians taught me,
during that quest, that military conflicts are typically
put into three categories: local battles,
regional or theater wars, and the rare but all-important
global, world war -- strategic conflicts.
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources,
a different approach,
a different organizational model.
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories,
and most of what we think about
are local environmental problems: air pollution, water pollution,
hazardous waste dumps. But there are also
regional environmental problems, like acid rain
from the Midwest to the Northeast, and from Western Europe
to the Arctic, and from the Midwest
out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico.
And there are lots of those. But the climate crisis
is the rare but all-important
global, or strategic, conflict.
Everything is affected. And we have to organize our response
appropriately. We need a worldwide, global mobilization
for renewable energy, conservation, efficiency
and a global transition to a low-carbon economy.
We have work to do. And we can mobilize resources
and political will. But the political will
has to be mobilized, in order to mobilize the resources.
I thought I would start with the logo. What's missing here,
of course, is the North Polar ice cap.
Greenland remains. Twenty-eight years ago, this is what the
polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like
at the end of the summer, at the fall equinox.
This last fall, I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center
in Boulder, Colorado, and talked to the researchers
here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory.
This is what's happened in the last 28 years.
To put it in perspective, 2005 was the previous record.
Here's what happened last fall
that has really unnerved the researchers.
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically --
doesn't look quite the same size --
but it is exactly the same size as the United States,
minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona.
The amount that disappeared in 2005
was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi.
The extra amount that disappeared last fall
was equivalent to this much. It comes back in the winter,
but not as permanent ice, as thin ice --
vulnerable. The amount remaining could be completely gone
in summer in as little as five years.
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland.
Already, around the Arctic Circle --
this is a famous village in Alaska. This is a town
in Newfoundland. Antarctica. Latest studies from NASA.
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting
of an area equivalent to the size of California.
they were the worst of times": the most famous opening sentence
in English literature. I want to share briefly
a tale of two planets. Earth and Venus
are exactly the same size. Earth's diameter
is about 400 kilometers larger, but essentially the same size.
They have exactly the same amount of carbon.
But the difference is, on Earth, most of the carbon
has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere,
deposited in the ground as coal, oil,
natural gas, etc. On Venus, most of it
is in the atmosphere. The difference is that our temperature
is 59 degrees on average. On Venus,
it's 855. This is relevant to our current strategy
of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible,
and putting it into the atmosphere.
It's not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun.
It's three times hotter than Mercury,
which is right next to the Sun. Now, briefly,
here's an image you've seen, as one of the only old images,
but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI: Climate.
man-made global warming pollution, put into the atmosphere,
thickening this, is trapping more of the outgoing infrared.
You all know that. At the last
IPCC summary, the scientists wanted to say,
"How certain are you?" They wanted to answer that "99 percent."
The Chinese objected, and so the compromise was
"more than 90 percent."
Now, the skeptics say, "Oh, wait a minute,
this could be variations in this energy
coming in from the sun." If that were true,
the stratosphere would be heated as well as the
lower atmosphere, if it's more coming in.
If it's more being trapped on the way out, then you would
expect it to be warmer here and cooler here. Here is the lower atmosphere.
Here's the stratosphere: cooler.
CSI: Climate.
that human activity is responsible
for global warming. Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up
in a significant way. There has been progress,
but here is the key: when given a list
of challenges to confront, global warming is still listed at near the bottom.
What is missing is a sense of urgency.
If you agree with the factual analysis,
but you don't feel the sense of urgency,
where does that leave you?
Well, the Alliance for Climate Protection, which I head
in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono --
did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this.
This is the winner.
for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007
of the presidential candidates: two of them were about
the climate crisis. ABC: 844 questions, two about the climate crisis.
Fox: two. CNN: two. CBS: zero.
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older
tobacco commercials.
So here's what we're doing.
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries. And us.
But it's not just the developed nations.
The developing countries are now following us
and accelerating their pace. And actually,
their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent
to where we were in 1965. And they're catching up
very dramatically. The total concentrations:
by 2025, they will be essentially where we were in 1985.
If the wealthy countries were completely missing
from the picture, we would still have this crisis.
But we have given to the developing countries
the technologies and the ways of thinking
that are creating the crisis. This is in Bolivia --
over thirty years.
'70s. '80s. '90s. We have to stop this. And the good news is that we can.
We have the technologies.
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this:
the struggle against poverty in the world
and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions,
all has a single, very simple solution.
Put a price on carbon. We need a CO2 tax, revenue neutral,
to replace taxation on employment, which was invented by Bismarck --
and some things have changed
since the 19th century.
In the poor world, we have to integrate the responses
to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis.
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda
are mooted, if we do not solve the climate crisis.
in the poor countries. This is a proposal
that has been talked about a lot in Europe.
This was from Nature magazine. These are concentrating
solar, renewable energy plants, linked in a so-called "supergrid"
to supply all of the electrical power
to Europe, largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents.
This is not pie in the sky; this can be done.
The latest figures show that the old model
is not working. There are a lot of great investments
that you can make. If you are investing in tar sands
or shale oil, then you have a portfolio
that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets.
And it is based on an old model.
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones
in their arms and their legs collapse. Developing tar sands
and coal shale is the equivalent. Here are just a few of the investments
that I personally think make sense.
I have a stake in these, so I'll have a disclaimer there.
But geothermal, concentrating solar,
advanced photovoltaics, efficiency and conservation.
The only two countries that didn't ratify
-- and now there's only one. Australia had an election.
And there was a campaign in Australia
that involved television and Internet and radio commercials
to lift the sense of urgency for the people there.
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show
in every town and village and city in Australia.
Lot of other things contributed to it,
but the new Prime Minister announced that
his very first priority would be to change Australia's position
on Kyoto, and he has. Now, they came to an awareness
partly because of the horrible drought that they have had.
This is Lake Lanier. My friend Heidi Cullen
said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names,
we'd call the one in the southeast now Katrina,
and we would say it's headed toward Atlanta.
We can't wait for the kind of drought
Australia had to change our political culture.
Here's more good news. The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there,
just to localize this -- which is good news.
about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace
that it becomes banal or routine.
What we need is another hero generation. Those of us who are alive
in the United States of America
today especially, but also the rest of the world,
have to somehow understand that history
has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill [Bolte] Taylor was figuring out
how to save her life while she was distracted
by the amazing experience that she was going through.
We now have a culture of distraction.
But we have a planetary emergency.
And we have to find a way to create,
in the generation of those alive today, a sense of generational mission.
I wish I could find the words to convey this.
This was another hero generation
that brought democracy to the planet.
Another that ended slavery. And that gave women the right to vote.
We can do this. Don't tell me that we don't have the capacity to do it.
If we had just one week's worth of what we spend on the Iraq War,
we could be well on the way to solving this challenge.
We have the capacity to do it.
we have the capacity, at moments of great challenge,
to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge
that history is presenting to us.
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis
by saying, "Oh, this is so terrible.
What a burden we have." I would like to ask you
to reframe that. How many generations
in all of human history have had the opportunity
to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts?
A challenge that can pull from us
more than we knew we could do? I think we ought to approach
this challenge with a sense of profound joy
and gratitude that we are the generation
about which, a thousand years from now,
philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate
by saying, they were the ones that found it within themselves
to solve this crisis and lay the basis
for a bright and optimistic human future.
that basically a design issue
on a voting form --
one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn't being heard
like that in the last eight years in a position
where you could make these things come true.
That hurts.
in your own party are doing now -- I mean, there's --
are you excited by their plans on global warming?
because, on the one hand, I think that
we should feel really great about the fact
that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee --
John McCain, and both of the finalists
for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different
and forward-leaning position
on the climate crisis. All three have offered leadership,
and all three are very different from the approach taken
by the current administration. And I think
that all three have also been responsible in
putting forward plans and proposals. But the campaign dialogue that --
as illustrated by the questions --
that was put together by the
League of Conservation Voters, by the way, the analysis of all the questions --
and, by the way, the debates have all been
sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label,
"Clean Coal." Has anybody noticed that?
Every single debate has been sponsored by "Clean Coal."
"Now, even lower emissions!"
in our democracy has not laid the basis
for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed.
So they're saying the right things and they may --
whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing,
but let me tell you: when I came back from Kyoto
in 1997, with a feeling of great happiness
that we'd gotten that breakthrough there,
and then confronted the United States Senate,
only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote
to confirm, to ratify that treaty. Whatever the candidates say
has to be laid alongside what the people say.
of our whole civilization.
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization, literally.
And now we mechanized that process. Changing that pattern
requires a scope, a scale, a speed of change
that is beyond what we have done in the past.
So that's why I began by saying,
be optimistic in what you do, but be an active citizen.
Demand -- change the light bulbs,
but change the laws. Change the global treaties.
We have to speak up. We have to solve this democracy -- this --
We have sclerosis in our democracy. And we have to change that.
Use the Internet. Go on the Internet.
Connect with people. Become very active as citizens.
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn't
have any new coal-fired generating plants
that aren't able to capture and store CO2, which means we have to
quickly build these renewable sources.
Now, nobody is talking on that scale. But I do believe
that between now and November, it is possible.
This Alliance for Climate Protection
is going to launch a nationwide campaign --
grassroots mobilization, television ads, Internet ads,
radio, newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody
from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen.
Al, is there something more than that
you would like to be doing?
to that question. What can I do?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote, "If the future
of all human civilization depended on me, what would I do?
How would I be?" It does depend on all of us,
but again, not just with the light bulbs.
We, most of us here, are Americans. We have a democracy.
We can change things, but we have to actively change.
What's needed really is a higher level of consciousness.
And that's hard to --
that's hard to create -- but it is coming.
There's an old African proverb that some of you know
that says, "If you want to go quickly, go alone;
if you want to go far, go together." We have to go far, quickly.
So we have to have a change in consciousness.
A change in commitment. A new sense of urgency.
A new appreciation for the privilege
that we have of undertaking this challenge.
especially in large urban areas like New York City.

The fragrance that you will smell, you will never be able to smell this way again.
It’s a fragrance called Beyond Paradise,
which you can find in any store in the nation.
Except here it’s been split up in parts by Estée Lauder
and by the perfumer who did it, Calice Becker,
and I'm most grateful to them for this.
And it’s been split up in successive bits and a chord.
And then will come what they call the heart, the lush heart note.
I will show it to you.
The Eden top note is named after the Eden Project in the U.K.
because it’s totally forbidden.
Now what you are smelling is a combination of --
I asked how many molecules there were in there, and nobody would tell me.
So I put it through a G.C., a Gas Chromatograph that I have in my office,
and it’s about 400.
So what you’re smelling is several hundred molecules
floating through the air, hitting your nose.
You are all smelling pretty much the same thing, OK?
Smell has this reputation of being somewhat different for each person.
It’s not really true.
And perfumery shows you that can’t be true,
because if it were like that it wouldn’t be an art, OK?
Everything that you’re smelling in here
is made up of atoms that come from what I call
the Upper East Side of the periodic table -- a nice, safe neighborhood.
(Laughter)
You really don’t want to leave it if you want to have a career in perfumery.
Some people have tried in the 1920s
to add things from the bad parts, and it didn’t really work.
that you’re going to smell in real life, from coffee to fragrance, are made of.
The top note that you smelled at the very beginning,
the cut-grass green, what we call in perfumery -- they’re weird terms --
and this would be called a green note,
because it smells of something green, like cut grass.
in the last three years. A very expensive high school chemistry education.
This has six carbon atoms, so "hexa," hexene-1-ol.
It has one double bond, it has an alcohol on the end,
so it’s "ol," and that’s why they call it cis-3-hexene-1-ol.
Once you figure this out, you can really impress people at parties.
If you dress it up with atoms, hydrogen atoms --
that’s what it looks like when you have it on your computer --
but actually it’s sort of more like this, in the sense that the atoms have a certain
sphere that you cannot penetrate. They repel.
Why doesn’t it smell of potatoes or violets? Well, there are really two theories.
But the first theory is: it must be the shape.
And that’s a perfectly reasonable theory in the sense that
almost everything else in biology works by shape.
Enzymes that chew things up, antibodies, it’s all, you know,
the fit between a protein and whatever it is grabbing, in this case a smell.
And I will try and explain to you what’s wrong with this notion.
Now, this is a totally insane idea.
And when I first came across it in the early '90s, I thought my predecessor,
Malcolm Dyson and Bob Wright, had really taken leave of their senses,
and I’ll explain to you why this was the case.
However, I came to realize gradually that they may be right --
and I have to convince all my colleagues that this is so, but I’m working on it.
You have a molecule coming in, it gets into the protein, which is schematic here,
and it causes this thing to switch, to turn, to move in some way
by binding in certain parts.
And the attraction, the forces, between the molecule and the protein
cause the motion. This is a shape-based idea.
The way --I expect everybody to memorize these compounds.
This is one page of work from a chemist’s workbook, OK?
Working for a fragrance company.
He’s making 45 molecules, and he’s looking for a sandalwood,
something that smells of sandalwood.
Because there’s a lot of money in sandalwoods.
And of these 45 molecules, only 4629 actually smells of sandalwood.
And he puts an exclamation mark, OK? This is an awful lot of work.
This actually is roughly, in man-years of work, 200,000 dollars roughly,
if you keep them on the low salaries with no benefits.
So this is a profoundly inefficient process.
And my definition of a theory is, it’s not just something
that you teach people; it’s labor saving.
A theory is something that enables you to do less work.
I love the idea of doing less work. So let me explain to you why -- a very simple fact
that tells you why this shape theory really does not work very well.
This is cis-3-hexene-1-thiol, and this smells of rotten eggs, OK?
Now, you will have noticed that vodka never smells of rotten eggs.
If it does, you put the glass down, you go to a different bar.
This is -- in other words, we never get the O-H --
we never mistake it for an S-H, OK?
Like, at no concentration, even pure, you know,
if you smelt pure ethanol, it doesn’t smell of rotten eggs.
Conversely, there is no concentration at which the sulfur compound will smell like vodka.
It’s very hard to explain this by molecular recognition.
Now, I showed this to a physicist friend of mine who has a profound distaste
for biology, and he says, "That’s easy! The things are a different color!"
(Laughter)
some sort of interest in it. These molecules, as you saw in the beginning,
the building blocks had springs connecting them to each other.
In fact, molecules are able to vibrate at a set of frequencies
which are very specific for each molecule and for the bonds connecting them.
S-H, quite a different frequency.
Now, this is kind of interesting, because it tells you
that you should be looking for a particular fact, which is this:
nothing in the world smells like rotten eggs except S-H, OK?
If you look on this, imagine a piano keyboard.
The S-H stretch is in the middle of a part of the keyboard
that has been, so to speak, damaged,
and there are no neighboring notes, nothing is close to it.
You have a unique smell, a unique vibration.
to convince myself that there was any degree of plausibility
to this whole crazy story.
I went searching for a type of molecule, any molecule,
that would have that vibration and that -- the obvious prediction
was that it should absolutely smell of sulfur.
If it didn’t, the whole idea was toast, and I might as well move on to other things.
I discovered that there was a type of molecule called a Borane
which has exactly the same vibration.
Now the good news is, Boranes you can get hold of.
The bad news is they’re rocket fuels.
Most of them explode spontaneously in contact with air,
and when you call up the companies, they only give you minimum ten tons, OK?
(Laughter)
So this was not what they call a laboratory-scale experiment,
and they wouldn’t have liked it at my college.
And it really does have the same -- if you calculate,
if you measure the vibrational frequencies, they are the same as S-H.
there’s a man who knew more about Boranes than anyone
alive then or since, Alfred Stock, he synthesized all of them.
And in an enormous 40-page paper in German he says, at one point --
my wife is German and she translated it for me --
and at one point he says, "ganz widerlich Geruch,"
an "absolutely repulsive smell," which is good. Reminiscent of hydrogen sulfide.
So this fact that Boranes smell of sulfur
had been known since 1910, and utterly forgotten until 1997, 1998.
if we smell molecular vibrations, we must have a spectroscope in our nose.
Now, this is a spectroscope, OK, on my laboratory bench.
And it’s fair to say that if you look up somebody’s nose,
you’re unlikely to see anything resembling this.
And this is the main objection to the theory.
Now when people ask this kind of question, they neglect something,
which is that physicists are really clever, unlike biologists.
(Laughter)
This is a joke. I’m a biologist, OK?
So it’s a joke against myself.
in the days when Ford Motor was spending vast amounts of money
on fundamental research, discovered a way
to build a spectroscope that was intrinsically nano-scale.
In other words, no mirrors, no lasers, no prisms, no nonsense,
just a tiny device, and he built this device. And this device uses electron tunneling.
Now, I could do the dance of electron tunneling,
but I’ve done a video instead, which is much more interesting. Here’s how it works.
but only at equal energy. If the energy differs, they can’t jump.
Unlike us, they won’t fall off the cliff.
OK. Now. If something absorbs the energy, the electron can travel.
So here you have a system, you have something --
and there’s plenty of that stuff in biology --
some substance giving an electron, and the electron tries to jump,
and only when a molecule comes along that has the right vibration
does the reaction happen, OK?
This is the basis for the device that these two guys at Ford built.
In other words, I’ve taken off-the-shelf components,
and I’ve made a spectroscope.
What’s nice about this idea, if you have a philosophical bent of mind,
is that then it tells you that the nose,
the ear and the eye are all vibrational senses.
Of course, it doesn’t matter, because it could also be that they’re not.
But it has a certain --
(Laughter)
-- it has a certain ring to it which is attractive to people
who read too much 19th-century German literature.
I left academia and joined the real world of business,
and a company was created around my ideas
to make new molecules using my method,
along the lines of, let’s put someone else’s money where your mouth is.
And one of the first things that happened was
we started going around to fragrance companies
asking for what they needed, because, of course,
if you could calculate smell, you don’t need chemists.
You need a computer, a Mac will do it, if you know how to program the thing right,
OK? So you can try a thousand molecules,
you can try ten thousand molecules in a weekend,
and then you only tell the chemists to make the right one.
And so that’s a direct path to making new odorants.
we went to see some perfumers in France --
and here’s where I do my Charles Fleischer impression --
and one of them says, "You cannot make a coumarin."
He says to me, "I bet you cannot make a coumarin."
in fragrance which is derived from a bean that comes from South America.
And it is the classic synthetic aroma chemical, OK?
It’s the molecule that has made men’s fragrances
smell the way they do since 1881, to be exact.
So nobody likes particularly to -- you know, aftershave with carcinogens.
(Laughter)
There are some reckless people, but it’s not worth it, OK?
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum
of coumarin, and you smooth it out,
so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is.
And then you start cranking the computer to find other molecules,
related or unrelated, that have the same vibrations.
it happened -- it was serendipitous.
Because I got a phone call from our chief chemist
and he said, look, I’ve just found this such a beautiful reaction,
that even if this compound doesn’t smell of coumarin,
I want to do it, it’s just such a nifty,
one step -- I mean, chemists have weird minds --
one step, 90 percent yield, you know, and you get this lovely
crystalline compound. Let us try it.
which is related to coumarin, but has an extra pentagon inserted into the molecule.
Calculate the vibrations, the purple spectrum is that new fellow,
the white one is the old one.
And the prediction is it should smell of coumarin.
They made it ... and it smelled exactly like coumarin.
And this is our new baby, called tonkene.
You see, when you’re a scientist, you’re always selling ideas.
And people are very resistant to ideas, and rightly so.
Why should new ideas be accepted?
But when you put a little 10-gram vial on the table in front of perfumers
and it smells like coumarin, and it isn’t coumarin,
and you’ve found it in three weeks,
this focuses everybody’s mind wonderfully.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And I said, well, by whom? I mean most, you know -- there’s three attitudes:
You’re right, and I don’t know why, which is the most rational one at this point.
You’re right, and I don’t care how you do it, in a sense;
you bring me the molecules, you know.
And: You’re completely wrong, and I’m sure you’re completely wrong.
and this is the commercial world.
And they tell us that even if we do it by astrology, they’re happy.
But we’re not actually doing it by astrology.
But for the last three years, I’ve had what I consider to be
the best job in the entire universe, which is to put my hobby --
which is, you know, fragrance and all the magnificent things --
plus a little bit of biophysics, a small amount of self-taught chemistry
at the service of something that actually works.
(Applause)
So, about three years ago I was in London,
and somebody called Howard Burton came to me and said,
I represent a group of people,
and we want to start an institute in theoretical physics.
We have about 120 million dollars, and we want to do it well.
We want to be in the forefront fields,
and we want to do it differently.
We want to get out of this thing
where the young people have all the ideas, and the old people have all the power
and decide what science gets done.
It took me about 25 seconds to decide that that was a good idea.
in Waterloo, Ontario. It’s the most exciting job I’ve ever had.
And it’s the first time I’ve had a job where I’m afraid to go away
because of everything that’s going to happen in this week when I’m here.
(Laughter)
But in any case, what I’m going to do in my little bit of time
is take you on a quick tour of some of the things
that we talk about and we think about.
So, we think a lot about what really makes science work?
The first thing that anybody who knows science,
and has been around science,
is that the stuff you learn in school as a scientific method
is wrong. There is no method.
On the other hand, somehow we manage to reason together
as a community, from incomplete evidence
to conclusions that we all agree about.
And this is, by the way, something that a democratic society also has to do.
Well, my belief is that it works
because scientists are a community bound together by an ethics.
And here are some of the ethical principles.
I’m not going to read them all to you because I’m not in teacher mode.
I’m in entertain, amaze mode.
(Laughter)
who is part of the community gets to fight and argue
as hard as they can for what they believe.
But we’re all disciplined by the understanding
that the only people who are going to decide, you know,
whether I’m right or somebody else is right,
are the people in our community in the next generation,
in 30 and 50 years.
So it’s this combination of respect
for the tradition and community we’re in,
and rebellion that the community requires to get anywhere,
that makes science work.
And being in this process of being in a community
that reasons from shared evidence to conclusions,
I believe, teaches us about democracy.
Not only is there a relationship between the ethics of science
and the ethics of being a citizen in democracy,
but there has been, historically, a relationship
between how people think about space and time, and what the cosmos is,
and how people think about the society that they live in.
The first science of cosmology that was anything like science
was Aristotelian science, and that was hierarchical.
The earth is in the center, then there are these crystal spheres,
the sun, the moon, the planets and finally the celestial sphere,
where the stars are. And everything in this universe has a place.
And Aristotle’s law of motion was that everything
goes to its natural place, which was of course,
the rule of the society that Aristotle lived in,
and more importantly, the medieval society that, through Christianity,
embraced Aristotle and blessed it.
And the idea is that everything is defined.
Where something is, is defined with respect to this last sphere,
the celestial sphere, outside of which is this eternal,
perfect realm, where lives God,
who is the ultimate judge of everything.
and in a certain sense, medieval society.
Now, in the 17th century there was a revolution in thinking about
space and time and motion and so forth of Newton.
And at the same time there was a revolution in social thought
of John Locke and his collaborators.
And they were very closely associated.
In fact, Newton and Locke were friends.
Their way of thinking about space and time and motion on the one hand,
and a society on the other hand, were closely related.
In a Newtonian universe, there’s no center -- thank you.
There are particles and they move around
with respect to a fixed, absolute framework of space and time.
It’s meaningful to say absolutely where something is in space,
because that’s defined, not with respect to say, where other things are,
but with respect to this absolute notion of space,
which for Newton was God.
who have certain rights, properties in a formal sense,
and those are defined with respect to some absolute,
abstract notions of rights and justice, and so forth,
which are independent of what else has happened in the society.
Of who else there is, of the history and so forth.
There is also an omniscient observer
who knows everything, who is God,
who is in a certain sense outside the universe,
because he has no role in anything that happens,
but is in a certain sense everywhere,
because space is just the way that God knows
where everything is, according to Newton, OK?
liberal political theory and Newtonian physics.
Now, in the 20th century we had a revolution
that was initiated at the beginning of the 20th century,
and which is still going on.
It was begun with the invention
of relativity theory and quantum theory.
And merging them together to make the final quantum theory
of space and time and gravity, is the culmination of that,
something that’s going on right now.
And in this universe there’s nothing fixed and absolute. Zilch, OK.
This universe is described by being a network of relationships.
absolutely where something is.
There’s only where it is relative to everything else that is.
And this network of relations is ever-evolving.
So we call it a relational universe.
All properties of things are about these kinds of relationships.
And also, if you’re embedded in such a network of relationships,
your view of the world has to do with what information
comes to you through the network of relations.
And there’s no place for an omniscient observer
or an outside intelligence knowing everything and making everything.
So this is general relativity, this is quantum theory.
This is also, if you talk to legal scholars,
the foundations of new ideas in legal thought.
They’re thinking about the same things.
And not only that, they make the analogy
to relativity theory and cosmology often.
So there’s an interesting discussion going on there.
This last view of cosmology is called the relational view.
which means that there’s no place
to put an explanation for something outside.
So in such a relational universe,
if you come upon something that’s ordered and structured,
like this device here, or that device there,
or something beautiful, like all the living things,
all of you guys in the room --
"guys" in physics, by the way, is a generic term: men and women.
(Laughter)
you want to know how is it made.
And in a relational universe the only possible explanation was, somehow it made itself.
There must be mechanisms of self-organization
inside the universe that make things.
Because there’s no place to put a maker outside,
as there was in the Aristotelian and the Newtonian universe.
So in a relational universe we must have processes of self-organization.
that suffice to explain all of us and everything we see.
So it works. But not only that,
if you think about how natural selection works,
then it turns out that natural selection
would only make sense in such a relational universe.
That is, natural selection works on properties,
like fitness, which are about relationships
of some species to some other species.
Darwin wouldn’t make sense in an Aristotelian universe,
and wouldn’t really make sense in a Newtonian universe.
requires a relational notion of
what are the properties of biological systems.
And if you push that all the way down, really,
it makes the best sense in a relational universe
where all properties are relational.
Now, not only that, but Einstein taught us
that gravity is the result of the world being relational.
If it wasn’t for gravity, there wouldn’t be life,
because gravity causes stars to form and live for a very long time,
keeping pieces of the world, like the surface of the Earth,
out of thermal equilibrium for billions of years so life can evolve.
we saw the independent development of two big themes in science.
In the biological sciences, they explored
the implications of the notion that order and complexity
and structure arise in a self-organized way.
That was the triumph of Neo-Darwinism and so forth.
And slowly, that idea is leaking out to the cognitive sciences,
the human sciences, economics, et cetera.
At the same time, we physicists
have been busy trying to make sense of
and build on and integrate the discoveries
of quantum theory and relativity.
of the idea that the universe is made up of relations.
21st-century science is going to be driven
by the integration of these two ideas:
the triumph of relational ways of thinking
about the world, on the one hand,
and self-organization or Darwinian ways of thinking about the world,
on the other hand.
And also, is that in the 21st century
our thinking about space and time and cosmology,
and our thinking about society are both going to continue to evolve.
And what they’re evolving towards is the union
of these two big ideas, Darwinism and relationalism.
a new pluralistic notion of democracy would be one that recognizes
that there are many different interests, many different agendas,
many different individuals, many different points of view.
Each one is incomplete, because you’re embedded
in a network of relationships.
Any actor in a democracy is embedded
in a network of relationships.
And you understand some things better than other things,
and because of that there’s a continual jostling
and give and take, which is politics.
And politics is, in the ideal sense,
the way in which we continually address
our network of relations in order to achieve
a better life and a better society.
I’m finishing on this line.
(Laughter)
In fact, I’m finished. Science will never go away.
(Music)
And I say "thank you for being here" because I was silent for 17 years.
And the first words that I spoke were in Washington, D.C.,
on the 20th anniversary of Earth Day.
And my family and friends had gathered there to hear me speak.
And I said, "Thank you for being here."
My mother, out in the audience, she jumped up,
"Hallelujah, Johnny’s talking!"
and your mother was out in the audience, say.
My dad said to me, "That’s one" --
I’ll explain that.
But I turned around because I didn’t recognize where my voice was coming from.
I hadn’t heard my voice in 17 years,
so I turned around and I looked and I said,
"God, who's saying what I’m thinking?"
And then I realized it was me, you know, and I kind of laughed.
And I could see my father: "Yeah, he really is crazy."
Well, I want to take you on this journey.
And the journey, I believe, is a metaphor for all of our journeys.
Even though this one is kind of unusual,
I want you to think about your own journey.
when I witnessed two oil tankers collide beneath the Golden Gate,
and a half a million gallons of oil spilled into the bay.
It disturbed me so much
that I decided that I was going to give up riding and driving in motorized vehicles.
That’s a big thing in California.
And it was a big thing in my little community of Point Reyes Station
in Inverness, California, because there were only
about 350 people there in the winter – this was back in '71 now.
And so when I came in and I started walking around, people --
they just knew what was going on.
And people would drive up next to me
and say, "John, what are you doing?"
And I’d say, "Well, I’m walking for the environment."
And they said, "No, you’re walking to make us look bad, right?
You’re walking to make us feel bad."
And maybe there was some truth to that,
because I thought that if I started walking, everyone would follow.
Because of the oil, everybody talked about the polllution.
And so I argued with people about that, I argued and I argued.
I called my parents up.
I said, "I’ve given up riding and driving in cars."
My dad said, "Why didn’t you do that when you were 16?"
They’re back in Philadelphia.
And so I told my mother, "I’m happy though, I’m really happy."
She said, "If you were happy, son, you wouldn’t have to say it."
Mothers are like that.
and I talk so much, that I was going to stop speaking
for just one day -- one day -- to give it a rest.
And so I did.
I got up in the morning and I didn’t say a word.
And I have to tell you, it was a very moving experience,
because for the first time, I began listening -- in a long time.
And what I heard, it kind of disturbed me.
Because what I used to do, when I thought I was listening,
was I would listen just enough to hear what people had to say
and think that I could -- I knew what they were going to say,
and so I stopped listening.
And in my mind, I just kind of raced ahead
and thought of what I was going to say back,
while they were still finishing up.
And then I would launch in.
Well, that just ended communication.
And it was very sad for me,
because I realized that for those many years I had not been learning.
I was 27. I thought I knew everything.
I didn’t.
And so I decided I’d better do this for another day,
and another day, and another day until finally,
I promised myself for a year I would keep quiet
because I started learning more and more and I needed to learn more.
So for a year I said I would keep quiet,
and then on my birthday I would reassess what I had learned
and maybe I would talk again.
Well, that lasted 17 years.
and I painted and I wrote in my journal, and
I tried to study the environment by reading books.
And I decided that I was going to go to school. So I did.
I walked up to Ashland, Oregon,
where they were offering an environmental studies degree.
It’s only 500 miles.
And I went into the Registrar’s office and --
"What, what, what?"
I had a newspaper clipping.
"Oh, so you really want to go to school here?
You don’t …?
We have a special program for you." They did.
And in those two years, I graduated with my first degree -- a bachelor’s degree.
And my father came out, he was so proud.
He said, "Listen, we’re really proud of you son,
but what are you going to do with a bachelor’s degree?
You don’t ride in cars, you don’t talk --
you’re going to have to do those things."
and I started walking.
I walked all the way up to Port Townsend, Washington, where I built a wooden boat,
rode it across Puget Sound
and walked across Washington [to] Idaho and down to Missoula, Montana.
I had written the University of Montana two years earlier
and said I'd like to go to school there.
I said I'd be there in about two years.
I tell this story because they really helped me.
There are two stories in Montana.
The first story is I didn’t have any money -- that’s a sign I used a lot.
And they said,"Don't worry about that."
The director of the program said, "Come back tomorrow."
He gave me 150 dollars,
and he said, "Register for one credit.
You’re going to go to South America, aren’t you?"
And I said --
Rivers and lakes, the hydrological systems, South America.
So I did that.
He came back; he said to me,
"OK John, now that you've registered for that one credit,
you can have a key to an office, you can matriculate --
you’re matriculating, so you can use the library.
And what we’re going to do
is, we’re going to have all of the professors allow you to go to class.
They’re going to save your grade,
and when we figure out how to get you the rest of the money,
then you can register for that class and they’ll give you the grade."
Wow, they don’t do that in graduate schools, I don’t think.
But I use that story because they really wanted to help me.
They saw that I was really interested in the environment,
and they really wanted to help me along the way.
I had 13 students when I first walked into the class.
I explained, with a friend who could interpret my sign language,
that I was John Francis, I was walking around the world,
I didn’t talk and this was the last time
this person’s going to be here interpreting for me.
All the students sat around and they went ...
to see when they could get out.
They had to take that class with me.
Two weeks later, everyone was trying to get into our class.
and they were all gathered around, going, "What's he trying to say?"
"I don't know, I think he's talking about clear cutting." "Yeah, clear cutting."
"No, no, no, that's not clear cutting, that’s -- he's using a handsaw."
"Well, you can’t clearcut with a ..."
"Yes, you can clear cut ..."
"No, I think he’s talking about selective forestry."
Now this was a discussion class and we were having a discussion.
I just backed out of that, you know, and I just kind of kept the fists from flying.
But what I learned was that sometimes I would make a sign
and they said things that I absolutely did not mean,
but I should have.
And so what came to me is, if you were a teacher
and you were teaching, if you weren’t learning
you probably weren’t teaching very well.
And so I went on.
and, you know, I did the deal,
and my father said, "We’re really proud of you son, but ... "
You know what went on,
he said, "You’ve got to start riding and driving and start talking.
What are you going to do with a master’s degree?"
I hunched my shoulder, I got my backpack
and I went on to the University of Wisconsin.
No one was interested in oil spills.
But something happened --
Exxon Valdez.
And I was the only one in the United States writing on oil spills.
My dad came out again.
He said, "I don't know how you do this, son --
I mean, you don't ride in cars, you don’t talk.
My sister said maybe I should leave you alone,
because you seem to be doing a lot better
when you’re not saying anything."
I put my banjo on and I walked all the way to the East Coast,
put my foot in the Atlantic Ocean --
it was seven years and one day it took me to walk across the United States.
the 20th anniversary of Earth Day -- that’s when I began to speak.
And that’s why I said, "Thank you for being here."
Because it's sort of like that tree in the forest falling;
and if there's no one there to hear, does it really make a sound?
And I’m thanking you, and I'm thanking my family
because they had come to hear me speak.
And that’s communication.
And they also taught me about listening -- that they listened to me.
And it’s one of those things that came out of the silence,
the listening to each other.
Really, very important --
we need to listen to each other.
Well, my journey kept going on.
My dad said, "That’s one,"
and I still didn’t let that go.
I wrote regulations for the United States --
I mean, I wrote oil spill regulations.
20 years ago, if someone had said to me,
"John, do you really want to make a difference?"
"Yeah, I want to make a difference."
He said, "You just start walking east;
get out of your car and just start walking east."
And as I walked off a little bit, they'd say, "Yeah, and shut up, too."
How could that be, how could that be?
How could doing such a simple thing like walking and not talking
make a difference?
And after that -- I only worked one year --
I said, "That's enough. One year's enough for me to do that."
I got on a sailboat and I sailed down to the Caribbean,
and walked through all of the islands, and to Venezuela.
And you know, I forgot the most important thing,
which is why I started talking, which I have to tell you.
I started talking because I had studied environment.
I’d studied environment at this formal level,
but there was this informal level.
And the informal level --
I learned about people, and what we do and how we are.
And environment changed from just being about trees and birds
and endangered species to being about how we treated each other.
Because if we are the environment,
then all we need to do is look around us
and see how we treat ourselves and how we treat each other.
And so that’s the message that I had.
And I said, "Well, I'm going to have to spread that message."
And I got in my sailboat, sailed all the way through the Caribbean --
it wasn't really my sailboat, I kind of worked on that boat --
got to Venezuela and I started walking.
because I still didn't ride in motorized vehicles.
I was walking through El Dorado -- it's a prison town, famous prison,
or infamous prison -- in Venezuela, and I don’t know what possessed me,
because this was not like me.
There I am, walking past the guard gate and the guard stops and says,
"Pasaporte, pasaporte," and with an M16 pointed at me.
And I looked at him and I said, "Passport, huh?
I don't need to show you my passport. It’s in the back of my pack.
I'm Dr. Francis; I'm a U.N. Ambassador and I'm walking around the world."
And I started walking off.
What possessed me to say this thing?
The road turned into the jungle.
I didn’t get shot.
And I got to -- I start saying, "Free at last --
thank God Almighty, I’m free at last."
"What was that about," I’m saying. What was that about?
I had become a prisoner.
I was a prisoner and I needed to escape.
The prison that I was in was the fact that I did not drive
or use motorized vehicles.
Now how could that be?
Because when I started, it seemed very appropriate to me
not to use motorized vehicles.
But the thing that was different
was that every birthday, I asked myself about silence,
but I never asked myself about my decision to just use my feet.
I had no idea I was going to become a U.N. Ambassador.
I had no idea I would have a Ph.D.
and that I was going to have to change.
You know, we can do it.
I was going to have to change.
And I was afraid to change,
because I was so used to the guy who only just walked.
I was so used to that person that I didn’t want to stop.
I didn’t know who I would be if I changed.
But I know I needed to.
I know I needed to change, because it would be the only way
that I could be here today.
And I know that a lot of times
we find ourselves in this wonderful place where we’ve gotten to,
but there’s another place for us to go.
And we kind of have to leave behind the security of who we’ve become,
and go to the place of who we are becoming.
And so, I want to encourage you to go to that next place,
to let yourself out of any prison that you might find yourself in,
as comfortable as it may be, because we have to do something now.
We have to change now.
As our former Vice President said,
we have to become activists.
So if my voice can touch you,
if my actions can touch you, if my being here can touch you,
please let it be.
And I know that all of you have touched me
while I’ve been here.
and take this caring, this love, this respect
that we’ve shown each other right here at TED,
and take this out into the world.
Because we are the environment,
and how we treat each other
is really how we’re going to treat the environment.
So I want to thank you for being here
and I want to end this in five seconds of silence.
so they instead become delusion?
where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes,
as compared with the brains of individuals
diagnosed with schizophrenia, schizoaffective or bipolar disorder?"
and then in what quantities of those chemicals?
I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own.
I essentially became an infant in a woman's body.
each of our hemispheres think about different things,
they care about different things, and, dare I say,
Our right hemisphere, it thinks in pictures
and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies.
Information, in the form of energy, streams in simultaneously
through all of our sensory systems
and then it explodes into this enormous collage
of what this present moment looks like,
what this present moment smells like and tastes like,
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me
And in this moment we are perfect, we are whole and we are beautiful.
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically.
Our left hemisphere is designed to take
that enormous collage of the present moment
and projects into the future all of our possibilities.
And our left hemisphere thinks in language.

blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall.
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy.
And I'm going, "Ahh! I've got a problem!"
And I felt lighter in my body.
and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone.
We've got to get help."
How many brain scientists have the opportunity
to study their own brain from the inside out?"
So I've got to call help. I've got to call work."
I couldn't remember the number at work,
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity.
In the meantime, for 45 minutes,
the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere.
I take the business card, I put it right here,
and I'm matching the shape of the squiggles on the card
to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad.
But then I would drift back out into La La Land,
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump
and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me,
that I couldn't speak or understand language until I tried.
I am the life-force power of the universe.
choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry
I really am honored to be here, and as Chris said,
it's been over 20 years since I started working in Africa.
My first introduction was at the Abidjan airport on a sweaty, Ivory Coast morning.
I had just left Wall Street, cut my hair to look like Margaret Mead,
given away most everything that I owned,
and arrived with all the essentials --
some poetry, a few clothes, and, of course, a guitar --
because I was going to save the world,
and I thought I would just start with the African continent.
by a number of West African women, that Africans didn't want saving,
thank you very much, least of all not by me.
I was too young, unmarried, I had no children,
didn't really know Africa, and besides, my French was pitiful.
And so, it was an incredibly painful time in my life,
and yet it really started to give me the humility to start listening.
so I moved to Kenya and worked in Uganda,
and I met a group of Rwandan women, who asked me, in 1986,
to move to Kigali to help them start the first microfinance institution there.
And I did, and we ended up naming it Duterimbere,
and started by women, and so maybe I should try to run a business, too.
And so I started looking around, and I heard about a bakery
that was run by 20 prostitutes.
And, being a little intrigued, I went to go meet this group,
and what I found was 20 unwed mothers who were trying to survive.
and how what we call people so often distances us from them,
and makes them little.
I also found out that the bakery was nothing like a business,
that, in fact, it was a classic charity run by a well-intentioned person,
who essentially spent 600 dollars a month
to keep these 20 women busy making little crafts and baked goods,
and living on 50 cents a day, still in poverty.
So, I made a deal with the women. I said, "Look, we get rid of the charity side,
and we run this as a business and I'll help you."
They nervously agreed. I nervously started, and, of course,
things are always harder than you think they're going to be.
and we clearly aren't the A-Team here,
so let's -- I did all this training.
And the epitome was when I literally marched into the streets
of Nyamirambo, which is the popular quarter of Kigali, with a bucket,
and I sold all these little doughnuts to people,
and I came back, and I was like, "You see?"
And the women said, "You know, Jacqueline, who in Nyamirambo is not going to buy
doughnuts out of an orange bucket from a tall American woman?" And like --
(Laughter) -- it's a good point.
with competitions, team and individual. Completely failed,
but over time, the women learnt to sell on their own way.
And they started listening to the marketplace,
and they came back with ideas for cassava chips, and banana chips,
and sorghum bread, and before you knew it,
we had cornered the Kigali market,
and the women were earning three to four times the national average.
And with that confidence surge, I thought, "Well, it's time to create a real bakery,
so let's paint it." And the women said, "That's a really great idea."
And I said, "Well, what color do you want to paint it?" And they said,
"Well, you choose." And I said, "No, no, I'm learning to listen.
You choose. It's your bakery, your street, your country -- not mine."
But they wouldn't give me an answer.
So, one week, two weeks, three weeks went by,
and finally I said, "Well, how about blue?"
And they said, "Blue, blue, we love blue. Let's do it blue."
So, I went to the store, I brought Gaudence, the recalcitrant one of all,
and we brought all this paint and fabric to make curtains,
and on painting day, we all gathered in Nyamirambo,
and the idea was we would paint it white with blue as trim,
like a little French bakery. But that was clearly not as satisfying
as painting a wall of blue like a morning sky.
The walls were blue, the windows were blue,
the sidewalk out front was painted blue.
And Aretha Franklin was shouting "R-E-S-P-E-C-T,"
the women's hips were swaying
and little kids were trying to grab the paintbrushes, but it was their day.
And at the end of it, we stood across the street
and we looked at what we had done, and I said, "It is so beautiful."
And the women said, "It really is."
And I said, "And I think the color is perfect,"
and they all nodded their head, except for Gaudence,
and I said, "What?"
And she said, "Nothing." And I said, "What?"
And she said, "Well, it is pretty, but, you know, our color, really, it is green." And --
(Laughter)
but that when you've lived on charity and dependent your whole life long,
it's really hard to say what you mean.
And, mostly because people never really ask you,
and when they do, you don't really think they want to know the truth.
And so then I learned that listening is not only about waiting,
but it's also learning how better to ask questions.
and it was an extraordinary time in my life.
And it taught me three lessons
that I think are so important for us today,
and certainly in the work that I do.
The first is that dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
As Eleni has said, when people gain income, they gain choice,
and that is fundamental to dignity.
But as human beings, we also want to see each other,
and we want to be heard by each other, and we should never forget that.
The second is that traditional charity and aid
are never going to solve the problems of poverty.
which is that markets alone also
are not going to solve the problems of poverty.
Yes, we ran this as a business,
but someone needed to pay the philanthropic support
that came into the training, and the management support, the strategic advice
and, maybe most important of all,
the access to new contacts, networks and new markets.
And so, on a micro level, there's a real role for this combination
of investment and philanthropy.
And on a macro level -- some of the speakers have inferred that
even health should be privatized.
But, having had a father with heart disease,
and realizing that what our family could afford
was not what he should have gotten,
and having a good friend step in to help,
I really believe that all people deserve access to health
at prices they can afford.
I think the market can help us figure that out,
but there's got to be a charitable component,
or I don't think we're going to create the kind of societies we want to live in.
build Acumen Fund about six years ago.
It's a nonprofit, venture capital fund for the poor,
a few oxymorons in one sentence.
It essentially raises charitable funds from individuals, foundations and corporations,
and then we turn around and we invest equity and loans
in both for-profit and nonprofit entities
that deliver affordable health, housing, energy, clean water
to low income people in South Asia and Africa,
so that they can make their own choices.
We've invested about 20 million dollars in 20 different enterprises,
and have, in so doing, created nearly 20,000 jobs,
and delivered tens of millions of services to people
who otherwise would not be able to afford them.
Both of them are about investing in entrepreneurs
who are committed to service, and who really know the markets.
Both of them live at the confluence of public health and enterprise,
and both of them, because they're manufacturers,
create jobs directly, and create incomes indirectly,
because they're in the malaria sector,
and Africa loses about 13 billion dollars a year because of malaria.
And so as people get healthier, they also get wealthier.
It's a company built in Kenya about seven years ago
by an incredible entrepreneur named Patrick Henfrey and his three colleagues.
These are old-hand farmers
who've gone through all the agricultural ups and downs
in Kenya over the last 30 years.
Now, this plant is an Artemisia plant;
it's the basic component for artemisinin,
which is the best-known treatment for malaria.
It's indigenous to China and the Far East,
but given that the prevalence of malaria is here in Africa,
Patrick and his colleagues said, "Let's bring it here,
because it's a high value-add product."
The farmers get three to four times the yields that they would with maize.
that actually got below market returns
and was willing to go the long haul and be combined
with management assistance, strategic assistance --
they've now created a company where they purchase from 7,500 farmers.
So that's about 50,000 people affected.
And I think some of you may have visited --
these farmers are helped by KickStart and TechnoServe,
who help them become more self-sufficient.
They buy it, they dry it and they bring it to this factory,
which was purchased in part by, again, patient capital from Novartis,
who has a real interest in getting the powder
so that they can make Coartem.
Acumen's been working with ABE for the past year, year and a half,
both on looking at a new business plan,
and what does expansion look like, helping with management support
and helping to do term sheets and raise capital.
And I really understood what patient capital meant emotionally
in the last month or so. Because the company was literally
10 days away from proving that the product they produced
was at the world-quality level needed to make Coartem,
when they were in the biggest cash crisis of their history.
Now, some of these same social investors are really interested in Africa
and understand the importance of agriculture,
and they even helped the farmers.
And even when we explained that if ABE goes away,
all those 7,500 jobs go away too,
we sometimes have this bifurcation between business and the social.
And it's really time we start thinking more creatively about how they can be fused.
So Acumen made not one, but two bridge loans,
and the good news is they did indeed meet world-quality classification and are now
in the final stages of closing a 20-million-dollar round, to move it to the next level,
and I think that this will be one of the more important companies in East Africa.
He was actually living in the Kibera slums
when his father called him and told him about Artemisia and the value-add potential.
So he moved back to the farm, and, long story short,
they now have seven acres under cultivation.
Samuel's kids are in private school,
and he's starting to help other farmers in the area also go into Artemisia production --
dignity being more important than wealth.
I talked about it a little at Oxford two years ago,
and some of you visited A to Z manufacturing,
which is one of the great, real companies in East Africa.
It's another one that lives at the confluence of health and enterprise.
And this is really a story about a public-private solution
that has really worked.
It started in Japan. Sumitomo had developed a technology
essentially to impregnate a polyethylene-based fiber with organic insecticide,
so you could create a bed net,
a malaria bed net, that would last five years and not need to be re-dipped.
it had been produced only in East Asia. And as part of its social responsibility,
Sumitomo said, "Why don't we experiment
with whether we can produce it in Africa, for Africans?"
UNICEF came forward and said, "We'll buy most of the nets,
and then we'll give them away, as part of the global fund's
and the U.N.'s commitment to pregnant women and children, for free."
Acumen came in with the patient capital,
and we also helped to identify the entrepreneur
that we would all partner with here in Africa,
and Exxon provided the initial resin.
there was none better that we could find on earth than Anuj Shah,
in A to Z manufacturing company.
It's a 40-year-old company, it understands manufacturing.
It's gone from socialist Tanzania into capitalist Tanzania,
and continued to flourish. It had about 1,000 employees when we first found it.
And so, Anuj took the entrepreneurial risk here in Africa
to produce a public good that was purchased by the aid establishment
to work with malaria.
In our first year, the first net went off the line in October of 2003.
We thought the hitting-it-out-of-the-box number was 150,000 nets a year.
This year, they are now producing eight million nets a year,
and they employ 5,000 people, 90 percent of whom are women, mostly unskilled.
They're in a joint venture with Sumitomo.
And so, from an enterprise perspective for Africa,
and from a public health perspective, these are real successes.
because it's not long-term sustainable.
It's a company with one big customer.
And if avian flu hits, or for any other reason
the world decides that malaria is no longer as much of a priority, everybody loses.
And so, Anuj and Acumen
have been talking about testing the private sector,
because the assumption that the aid establishment has made is that,
look, in a country like Tanzania,
80 percent of the population makes less than two dollars a day.
It costs, at manufacturing point, six dollars to produce these,
and it costs the establishment another six dollars to distribute it,
so the market price in a free market would be about 12 dollars per net.
Most people can't afford that, so let's give it away free.
And we said, "Well, there's another option.
Let's use the market as the best listening device we have, and
understand at what price people would pay for this, so they get the dignity of choice.
We can start building local distribution,
and actually, it can cost the public sector much less."
a loan as well as a grant, so that A to Z could play with pricing
and listen to the marketplace, and found a number of things.
One, that people will pay different prices,
but the overwhelming number of people will come forth at one dollar per net
and make a decision to buy it.
And when you listen to them, they'll also have a lot to say
about what they like and what they don't like.
And that some of the channels we thought would work didn't work.
But because of this experimentation and iteration that was allowed
because of the patient capital,
we've now found that it costs about a dollar in the private sector
to distribute, and a dollar to buy the net.
So then, from a policy perspective, when you start with the market,
we have a choice.
We can continue going along at 12 dollars a net, and the customer pays zero,
or we could at least experiment with some of it, to charge one dollar a net,
costing the public sector another six dollars a net,
give the people the dignity of choice, and have a distribution system
that might, over time, start sustaining itself.
and I don't think there's any better way to start than using the market,
but also to bring other people to the table around it.
Whenever I go to visit A to Z, I think of my grandmother, Stella.
She was very much like those women sitting behind the sewing machines.
She grew up on a farm in Austria, very poor,
didn't have very much education.
She moved to the United States, where she met my grandfather,
who was a cement hauler,
and they had nine children. Three of them died as babies.
My grandmother had tuberculosis, and she worked in a sewing machine shop,
making shirts for about 10 cents an hour.
She, like so many of the women I see at A to Z,
worked hard every day, understood what suffering was,
had a deep faith in God, loved her children
and would never have accepted a handout.
But because she had the opportunity of the marketplace,
and she lived in a society that provided the safety
of having access to affordable health and education,
her children and their children were able to live
lives of real purpose and follow real dreams.
there are a lot of us --
and I see teachers and musicians, hedge fund managers, designers.
One sister who makes other people's wishes come true.
And my wish, when I see those women, I meet those farmers,
and I think about all the people across this continent
who are working hard every day,
is that they have that sense of opportunity and possibility,
and that they also can believe and get access to services,
so that their children, too, can live those lives of great purpose.
It shouldn't be that difficult.
But what it takes is a commitment from all of us
to essentially refuse trite assumptions,
get out of our ideological boxes.
It takes investing in those entrepreneurs that are committed
to service as well as to success.
It takes opening your arms, both, wide,
and expecting very little love in return,
but demanding accountability,
and bringing the accountability to the table as well.
And most of all, most of all,
it requires that all of us have the courage and the patience,
whether we are rich or poor, African or non-African,
local or diaspora, left or right,
to really start listening to each other.
Thank you.

an undergraduate course called Global Health.
And these were the results of the Swedish students.
I did it so I got the confidence interval, which is pretty narrow.
And I got happy, of course -- a 1.8 right answer out of five possible.
That means there was a place for a professor of international health

Vietnam had large families and short lives.
And if we look where the income ends up,
you will see that while population increases,
there are hundreds of millions in Asia getting out of poverty,
and we can expand this axis, and I can give it a new dimension here,
In some countries, 99.7% of children survive to five years of age;
I can split South Asia here. India's the big bubble in the middle.
The differences are much bigger than the weakness of the data.
This is Mao Zedong. He brought health to China.
And to show that, you can put on the way of United Arab Emirates.
They came from here, a mineral country.
In spite of falling oil prices, he brought this country up here.

It's as if the world is flattening off, isn't it?
These countries are lifting more than the economy,
This session is on natural wonders,
and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.
if you simply stop doing what's causing the problem.
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general
is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.
And so happiness is not something you get,
to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,
to be peaceful, to be joyful
and to realize that it's not something that you pursue and get,
but rather, it's something that you have already, until you disturb it.
what's causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness
To me, that's the real natural wonder.
we can talk about diet, stress management --
which are really these spiritual practices --
For reversing disease, that's what it takes.
And in our studies, what we've been able to do
and in many ways, ancient -- interventions can be.
and you can see the narrowing here.
A year later, it's not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.

The younger brother is 86; the older one is 95.
They're always there for me, and nobody else is.

For many people, those are choices worth making --
not to live longer, but to live better.
because it really is a problem.
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,
and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC.
Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well --
Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,
The other way is to change the type of food.
And fat has nine calories per gram,
whereas protein and carbs only have four.
So when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.
the percent of calories from fat is down,
you get all these calories that don't fill you up
And you get all the disease-protective substances.
but also what you include that's protective.
Bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids in processed food
and saturated fats, which we find in meat.
If you remember nothing else from this talk:
You want to do it in a way that enhances your health,
so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight,
and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat,
and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it.
While your cholesterol level has remained the same,
the research findings have changed."
There's more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,
there's less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.
So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn't happy.
So you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,
who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet,
of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.
And that's how your body excretes waste --
through your breath, bowels and perspiration.
So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.
And then, again, it's a spectrum:

looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,
in collaboration with Sloan Kettering and UCSF.
We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer,
who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.
We could randomly divide them into two groups,
and then we could have one group
And the differences were highly significant.
Finally, I wondered if there's any relationship

Finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients.
The tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,
and you can see clearly it's better a year later, along with the PSA going down.
are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,
in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke,
overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on.
But also, through mechanisms that we don't fully understand,
people who are lonely and depressed are many times --
three to five to ten times in some studies --
more likely to get sick and die prematurely.
And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.

Ben and Jerry's doesn't have "liver and onion" ice cream,

It's because, without leaving your armchair,
you can simulate that flavor and say "yuck" before you make it.
Here's two different futures that I invite you to contemplate.
You can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer.
You probably don't feel like you need a moment of thought.

And this is exactly what you expected, isn't it?
But these aren't the data. I made these up!
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs

What other way would there be to be better off?
Vegetably? Minerally? Animally?
Glorious!
Of course, six months later, Ray Kroc had exactly the same idea.

In this case, because this experiment uses them,
these are Monet prints.
Everybody ranks these Monet prints from the one they like the most

and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of.
They bring us the camera, we make up a contact sheet,
of meaningful things to them, and we say,
"Which one would you like to give up?"
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite:

In other words: yes, some things are better than others.
When our fears are unbounded and overblown,

And it doesn't matter how much information we're looking at,
how big these collections are or how big the images are.
Most of them are ordinary digital camera photos,
but this one, for example, is a scan from the Library of Congress,
To prove to you that it's really text, and not an image,
we can do something like so, to really show
that this is a real representation of the text; it's not a picture.
I wouldn't recommend it.
Every large image is the beginning of a section.
And this really gives you the joy and the good experience

We've done something

We've made up a fake ad that's very high resolution --
much higher than in an ordinary ad --

about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate.
We hope that this means no more pop-ups

But those are all the roads in the U.S.
So let's pull up, now, something else.
This is actually live on the Web now; you can go check it out.
co-advised by Steve Seitz at U.W.
The computer vision algorithms have registered these images together
so that they correspond to the real space in which these shots --
and these things have all been related spatially.
I'm not sure if I have time to show you any other environments.
Some are much more spatial.
from looking at the environments we've put up on the website.
We had to worry about the lawyers and so on.
And so these are all Flickr images,
and they've all been related spatially in this way.
We can just navigate in this very simple way.
it's everything from cell-phone cameras to professional SLRs,
So many of them are occluded by faces, and so on.
This is actually a poster of Notre Dame that registered correctly.
that's greater than the sum of the parts.
If somebody bothered to tag all of these saints
and say who they all are, then my photo of Notre Dame Cathedral
suddenly gets enriched with all of that data,
and I can use it as an entry point to dive into that space,
