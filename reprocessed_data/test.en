like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,
you'll probably end up in the ICU.
If you go through a metal detector,
you'll probably die.
If you get a bubble in your medicine --
because you have to mix it every morning --
and it stays in there,
you probably die.
If you run out of medicine, you definitely die.
But when I needed it,
it was a godsend.
Within a few days, I could walk again.
Within a few weeks, I was performing,
and in a few months,
I debuted at the Kennedy Center.
The pump was a little bit problematic when performing,
so I'd attach it to my inner thigh
with the help of the girdle and an ACE bandage.
Literally hundreds of elevator rides
were spent with me alone
stuffing the pump into my Spanx,
hoping the doors wouldn't open unexpectedly.
And the tubing coming out of my chest
was a nightmare for costume designers.
I graduated from graduate school in 2006,
and I got a fellowship to go back to Europe.
A few days after arriving,
I met this wonderful, old conductor
who started casting me in all of these roles.
And before long, I was commuting
between Budapest, Milan
and Florence.
Though I was attached
to this ugly, unwanted,
high-maintenance, mechanical pet,
my life was kind of like the happy part in an opera --
very complicated,
but in a good way.
of 2008,
my grandfather passed away.
He was a big figure in all of our lives,
and we loved him very much.
It certainly didn't prepare me
for what came next.
Seven weeks later,
I got a call from my family.
My father had been in a catastrophic car accident,
and he died.
At 24, my death would have been
entirely expected.
But his --
well, the only way I can articulate how it felt
was that it precipitated
my medical decline.
Against my doctors' and family's wishes,
I needed to go back for the funeral.
I had to say goodbye
in some way, shape or form.
But soon I was showing signs of right-heart failure,
and I had to return to sea level,
doing so knowing
that I probably would never see my home again.
but I had one left in Tel Aviv, so I went.
After one performance,
I could barely drag myself
from the stage to the taxicab.
I sat down and felt the blood
rush down from my face,
and in the heat of the desert,
I was freezing cold.
My fingers started turning blue,
and I was like, "What is going on here?"
I heard my heart's valves
snapping open and closed.
The cab stopped,
and I pulled my body from it
feeling each ounce of weight
as I walked to the elevator.
I fell through my apartment door
and crawled to the bathroom
where I found my problem:
I had forgotten to mix in
the most important part of my medicine.
I was dying,
and if I didn't mix that stuff up fast,
I would never leave that apartment alive.
I started mixing,
and I felt like everything was going to fall out through one hole or another,
but I just kept on going.
Finally, with the last bottle in and the last bubble out,
I attached the pump to the tubing
and lay there hoping it would kick in
soon enough.
If it didn't, I'd probably see my father
sooner than I anticipated.
Thankfully, in a few minutes,
I saw the signature hive-like rash
appear on my legs,
which is a side effect of the medication,
and I knew I'd be okay.
but I was scared.
I went back to the States,
anticipating I'd return to Europe,
but the heart catheterization
showed that I wasn't going anywhere
further that a flight-for-life from Johns Hopkins Hospital.
I performed here and there,
but as my condition deteriorated,
so did my voice.
My doctor wanted me to get on the list for a lung transplant.
I didn't.
I had two friends who had recently died
months after having very challenging surgeries.
I knew another young man, though, who had PH
who died while waiting for one.
I wanted to live.
I thought stem cells were a good option,
but they hadn't developed to a point
where I could take advantage of them yet.
I officially took a break from singing,
and I went to the Cleveland Clinic
to be reevaluated
for the third time in five years, for transplant.
I was sitting there kind of unenthusiastically talking
with the head transplant surgeon,
and I asked him if I needed a transplant,
what I could do to prepare.
He said, "Be happy.
A happy patient
is a healthy patient."
It was like in one verbal swoop
he had channeled my thoughts
on life and medicine
and Confucius.
I still didn't want a transplant,
but in a month,
I was back in the hospital
with some severely edemic kankles --
very attractive.
And it was right-heart failure.
it was time to take my doctor's advice.
It was time for me to go to Cleveland
and to start the agonizing wait
for a match.
But the next morning,
while I was still in the hospital,
I got a telephone call.
It was my doctor in Cleveland,
Marie Budev.
And they had lungs.
It was a match.
They were from Texas.
And everybody was really happy for me,
but me.
Because, despite their problems,
I had spent my whole life training my lungs,
and I was not particularly enthusiastic
about giving them up.
I flew to Cleveland,
and my family rushed there
in hopes that they would meet me
and say what we knew
might be our final goodbye.
But organs don't wait,
and I went into surgery
before I could say goodbye.
The last thing I remember
was lying on a white blanket,
telling my surgeon that I needed to see my mother again,
and to please try and save my voice.
I fell into this apocalyptic dream world.
I flatlined twice,
40 quarts of blood
were infused into my body.
And in my surgeon's 20-year career,
he said it was among the most difficult transplants
that he's ever performed.
They left my chest open for two weeks.
You could see my over-sized heart
beating inside of it.
I was on a dozen machines
that were keeping me alive.
An infection ravaged my skin.
I had hoped my voice would be saved,
but my doctors knew
that the breathing tubes going down my throat
might have already destroyed it.
If they stayed in, there was no way I would ever sing again.
So my doctor got the ENT,
the top guy at the clinic, to come down
and give me surgery
to move the tubes around my voice box.
He said it would kill me.
So my own surgeon performed the procedure
in a last-ditch attempt to save my voice.
before the surgery,
she didn't leave my side
in the months of recovery that followed.
And if you want an example
of perseverance,
grit and strength
in a beautiful, little package,
it is her.
One year ago
to this very day,
I woke up.
I was 95 lbs.
There were a dozen tubes
coming in and out of my body.
I couldn't walk, I couldn't talk,
I couldn't eat, I couldn't move,
I certainly couldn't sing,
I couldn't even breathe,
but when I looked up
and I saw my mother,
I couldn't help but smile.
or by heart failure
or faulty lungs,
death happens.
But life isn't really just about avoiding death, is it?
It's about living.
Medical conditions don't negate the human condition.
And when people are allowed
to pursue their passions,
doctors will find they have better,
happier and healthier patients.
My parents were totally stressed out
about me going and auditioning
and traveling and performing all over the place,
but they knew that it was much better for me to do that
than be preoccupied with my own mortality all of the time.
And I'm so grateful they did.
and dancing and playing with my nieces and my nephews
and my brothers and my sisters and my mother and my grandmother
in the Colorado Rockies,
I couldn't help but think of that doctor
who told me that I couldn't sing.
And I wanted to tell her,
and I want to tell you,
we need to stop letting disease
divorce us from our dreams.
When we do,
we will find that patients
don't just survive;
we thrive.
And some of us
might even sing.
[Singing: French]
(Applause)
Thank you.
And I'd like to thank my pianist, Monica Lee.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you.
The second thing I want to do is introduce my co-author
and dear friend and co-teacher.
Ken and I have been working together
for almost 40 years.
That's Ken Sharpe over there.
certainly me and most of the people I talk to --
a kind of collective dissatisfaction
with the way things are working,
with the way our institutions run.
Our kids' teachers seem to be failing them.
Our doctors don't know who the hell we are,
and they don't have enough time for us.
We certainly can't trust the bankers,
and we certainly can't trust the brokers.
They almost brought the entire financial system down.
And even as we do our own work,
all too often,
we find ourselves having to choose
between doing what we think is the right thing
and doing the expected thing,
or the required thing,
or the profitable thing.
So everywhere we look,
pretty much across the board,
we worry that the people we depend on
don't really have our interests at heart.
Or if they do have our interests at heart,
we worry that they don't know us well enough
to figure out what they need to do
in order to allow us
to secure those interests.
They don't understand us.
They don't have the time to get to know us.
that we make
to this sort of general dissatisfaction.
If things aren't going right,
the first response is:
let's make more rules,
let's set up a set
of detailed procedures
to make sure that people will do the right thing.
Give teachers scripts
to follow in the classroom,
so even if they don't know what they're doing
and don't care about the welfare of our kids,
as long as they follow the scripts,
our kids will get educated.
Give judges a list of mandatory sentences
to impose for crimes,
so that you don't need to rely
on judges using their judgment.
Instead, all they have to do
is look up on the list
what kind of sentence goes with what kind of crime.
Impose limits
on what credit card companies can charge in interest
and on what they can charge in fees.
More and more rules
to protect us
against an indifferent, uncaring
set of institutions we have to deal with.
in addition to rules,
let's see if we can come up
with some really clever incentives
so that, even if the people we deal with
don't particularly want to serve our interests,
it is in their interest
to serve our interest --
the magic incentives
that will get people to do the right thing
even out of pure selfishness.
So we offer teachers bonuses
if the kids they teach
score passing grades on these big test scores
that are used to evaluate
the quality of school systems.
"sticks" and "carrots."
We passed a bunch of rules
to regulate the financial industry
in response to the recent collapse.
There's the Dodd-Frank Act,
there's the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency
that is temporarily being headed through the backdoor
by Elizabeth Warren.
Maybe these rules
will actually improve
the way these financial services companies behave.
We'll see.
In addition, we are struggling
to find some way to create incentives
for people in the financial services industry
that will have them more interested
in serving the long-term interests
even of their own companies,
rather than securing short-term profits.
So if we find just the right incentives,
they'll do the right thing -- as I said -- selfishly,
and if we come up with the right rules and regulations,
they won't drive us all over a cliff.
And Ken [Sharpe] and I certainly know
that you need to reign in the bankers.
If there is a lesson to be learned from the financial collapse
it is that.
and what we argue in the book,
is that there is no set of rules,
no matter how detailed,
no matter how specific,
no matter how carefully monitored
and enforced,
there is no set of rules
that will get us what we need.
Why? Because bankers are smart people.
And, like water,
they will find cracks
in any set of rules.
You design a set of rules that will make sure
that the particular reason
why the financial system "almost-collapse"
can't happen again.
It is naive beyond description
to think that having blocked
this source of financial collapse,
you have blocked all possible sources of financial collapse.
So it's just a question of waiting for the next one
and then marveling at how we could have been so stupid
as not to protect ourselves against that.
beyond, or along with, better rules
and reasonably smart incentives,
is we need virtue.
We need character.
We need people who want to do the right thing.
And in particular,
the virtue that we need most of all
is the virtue that Aristotle called
"practical wisdom."
Practical wisdom
is the moral will
to do the right thing
and the moral skill
to figure out what the right thing is.
So Aristotle was very interested in watching
how the craftsmen around him worked.
And he was impressed
at how they would improvise
novel solutions to novel problems --
problems that they hadn't anticipated.
So one example is he sees these stonemasons
working on the Isle of Lesbos,
and they need to measure out
round columns.
Well if you think about it,
it's really hard to measure out round columns using a ruler.
So what do they do?
They fashion a novel solution to the problem.
They created a ruler that bends,
what we would call these days a tape measure --
a flexible rule,
a rule that bends.
And Aristotle said,
"Hah, they appreciated that sometimes
to design rounded columns,
you need to bend the rule."
And Aristotle said
often in dealing with other people,
we need to bend the rules.
demands a kind of flexibility
that no set of rules can encompass.
Wise people know when and how
to bend the rules.
Wise people know how to improvise.
The way my co-author , Ken, and I talk about it,
they are kind of like jazz musicians.
The rules are like the notes on the page,
and that gets you started,
but then you dance around the notes on the page,
coming up with just the right combination
for this particular moment
with this particular set of fellow players.
So for Aristotle,
the kind
of rule-bending,
rule exception-finding and improvisation
that you see in skilled craftsmen
is exactly what you need
to be a skilled moral craftsman.
And in interactions with people,
almost all the time,
it is this kind of flexibility that is required.
A wise person knows when to bend the rules.
A wise person knows when to improvise.
And most important,
a wise person does this improvising and rule-bending
in the service of the right aims.
If you are a rule-bender and an improviser
mostly to serve yourself,
what you get is ruthless manipulation of other people.
So it matters that you do this wise practice
in the service of others
and not in the service of yourself.
And so the will to do the right thing
is just as important as the moral skill
of improvisation
and exception-finding.
Together they comprise practical wisdom,
which Aristotle thought
was the master virtue.
of wise practice in action.
It's the case of Michael.
Michael's a young guy.
He had a pretty low-wage job.
He was supporting his wife and a child,
and the child was going to parochial school.
Then he lost his job.
He panicked
about being able to support his family.
One night, he drank a little too much,
and he robbed a cab driver --
stole 50 dollars.
He robbed him at gunpoint.
It was a toy gun.
He got caught. He got tried.
He got convicted.
The Pennsylvania sentencing guidelines
required a minimum sentence for a crime like this
of two years, 24 months.
The judge on the case, Judge Lois Forer
thought that this made no sense.
He had never committed a crime before.
He was a responsible husband and father.
He had been faced with desperate circumstances.
All this would do is wreck a family.
And so she improvised a sentence -- 11 months,
and not only that,
but release every day to go to work.
Spend your night in jail, spend your day holding down a job.
He did. He served out his sentence.
He made restitution
and found himself a new job.
And the family was united.
to some sort of a decent life --
a happy ending to a story
involving wise improvisation
from a wise judge.
But it turned out
the prosecutor was not happy
that Judge Forer ignored the sentencing guidelines
and sort of invented her own,
and so he appealed.
And he asked for the mandatory minimum sentence
for armed robbery.
He did after all have a toy gun.
The mandatory minimum sentence for armed robbery
is five years.
He won the appeal.
Michael was sentenced to five years in prison.
Judge Forer had to follow the law.
And by the way, this appeal went through
after he had finished serving his sentence,
so he was out and working at a job
and taking care of his family
and he had to go back into jail.
Judge Forer did what she was required to do,
and then she quit the bench.
And Michael disappeared.
So that is an example,
both of wisdom in practice
and the subversion of wisdom
by rules that are meant, of course, to make things better.
Ms. Dewey's a teacher in a Texas elementary school.
She found herself listening to a consultant one day
who was trying to help teachers
boost the test scores of the kids,
so that the school
would reach the elite category
in percentage of kids passing big tests.
All these schools in Texas compete with one another
to achieve these milestones,
and there are bonuses and various other treats
that come if you beat the other schools.
So here was the consultant's advice:
first, don't waste your time on kids
who are going to pass the test no matter what you do.
Second, don't waste your time
on kids who can't pass the test
no matter what you do.
Third, don't waste your time
on kids who moved into the district
too late for their scores to be counted.
Focus all of your time and attention
on the kids who are on the bubble,
the so-called "bubble kids" --
kids where your intervention
can get them just maybe over the line
from failing to passing.
So Ms. Dewey heard this,
and she shook her head in despair
while fellow teachers were sort of cheering each other on
and nodding approvingly.
It's like they were about to go play a football game.
For Ms. Dewey,
this isn't why she became a teacher.
and we understand that you need to have rules.
You need to have incentives.
People have to make a living.
But the problem
with relying on rules and incentives
is that they demoralize
professional activity,
and they demoralize professional activity
in two senses.
First, they demoralize the people
who are engaged in the activity.
Judge Forer quits,
and Ms. Dewey in completely disheartened.
And second,
they demoralize the activity itself.
The very practice is demoralized,
and the practitioners are demoralized.
It creates people --
when you manipulate incentives to get people to do the right thing --
it creates people
who are addicted to incentives.
That is to say, it creates people
who only do things for incentives.
is that psychologists have known this
for 30 years.
Psychologists have known
about the negative consequences of incentivizing everything
for 30 years.
We know that if you reward kids for drawing pictures,
they stop caring about the drawing
and care only about the reward.
If you reward kids for reading books,
they stop caring about what's in the books
and only care about how long they are.
If you reward teachers for kids' test scores,
they stop caring about educating
and only care about test preparation.
If you were to reward doctors
for doing more procedures --
which is the current system -- they would do more.
If instead you reward doctors for doing fewer procedures,
they will do fewer.
What we want, of course,
is doctors who do just the right amount of procedures
and do the right amount for the right reason --
namely, to serve the welfare of their patients.
Psychologists have known this for decades,
and it's time for policymakers
to start paying attention
and listen to psychologists a little bit,
instead of economists.
We think, Ken and I, that there are real sources of hope.
We identify one set of people
in all of these practices
who we call canny outlaws.
These are people
who, being forced to operate
in a system that demands rule-following
and creates incentives,
find away around the rules,
find a way to subvert the rules.
So there are teachers who have these scripts to follow,
and they know that if they follow these scripts, the kids will learn nothing.
And so what they do is they follow the scripts,
but they follow the scripts at double-time
and squirrel away little bits of extra time
during which they teach in the way
that they actually know is effective.
So these are little ordinary, everyday heroes,
and they're incredibly admirable,
but there's no way that they can sustain this kind of activity
in the face of a system
that either roots them out
or grinds them down.
but it's hard to imagine any canny outlaw
sustaining that for an indefinite period of time.
More hopeful
are people we call system-changers.
These are people who are looking
not to dodge the system's rules and regulations,
but to transform the system,
and we talk about several.
One in particular
is a judge named Robert Russell.
And one day he was faced
with the case of Gary Pettengill.
Pettengill was a 23-year-old vet
who had planned to make the army a career,
but then he got a severe back injury in Iraq,
and that forced him to take a medical discharge.
He was married, he had a third kid on the way,
he suffered from PTSD, in addition to the bad back,
and recurrent nightmares,
and he had started using marijuana
to ease some of the symptoms.
He was only able to get part-time work because of his back,
and so he was unable to earn enough to put food on the table
and take care of his family.
So he started selling marijuana.
He was busted in a drug sweep.
His family was kicked out of their apartment,
and the welfare system
was threatening to take away his kids.
Judge Russell would have had little choice
but to sentence Pettengill to serious jail-time
as a drug felon.
But Judge Russell did have an alternative.
And that's because he was in a special court.
He was in a court called the Veterans' Court.
In the Veterans' Court --
this was the first of its kind in the United States.
Judge Russell created the Veterans' Court.
It was a court only for veterans
who had broken the law.
And he had created it exactly because
mandatory sentencing laws
were taking the judgment out of judging.
No one wanted non-violent offenders --
and especially non-violent offenders who were veterans to boot --
to be thrown into prison.
They wanted to do something about what we all know,
namely the revolving door of the criminal justice system.
And what the Veterans' Court did,
was it treated each criminal as an individual,
tried to get inside their problems,
tried to fashion responses to their crimes
that helped them to rehabilitate themselves,
and didn't forget about them once the judgment was made.
Stayed with them, followed up on them,
made sure that they were sticking to whatever plan
had been jointly developed
to get them over the hump.
that have Veterans' Courts like this.
Why has the idea spread?
Well, one reason is
that Judge Russell
has now seen 108 vets
in his Veterans' Court
as of February of this year,
and out of 108,
guess how many have gone back through
the revolving door of justice
into prison.
None. None.
Anyone would glom onto
a criminal justice system
that has this kind of a record.
So here's is a system-changer, and it seems to be catching.
who created a for-profit community bank
that encouraged bankers -- I know this is hard to believe --
encouraged bankers who worked there to do well
by doing good for their low-income clients.
The bank helped finance the rebuilding
of what was otherwise a dying community.
Though their loan recipients were high-risk by ordinary standards,
the default rate was extremely low.
The bank was profitable.
The bankers stayed with their loan recipients.
They didn't make loans and then sell the loans.
They serviced the loans.
They made sure that their loan recipients
were staying up with their payments.
Banking hasn't always been
the way we read about it now in the newspapers.
Even Goldman Sachs
once used to serve clients,
before it turned into an institution
that serves only itself.
Banking wasn't always this way,
and it doesn't have to be this way.
doctors at Harvard
who are trying to transform medical education,
so that you don't get a kind of ethical erosion
and loss of empathy,
which characterizes most medical students
in the course of their medical training.
And the way they do it is to give third-year medical students
patients who they follow for an entire year.
So the patients are not organ systems,
and they're not diseases;
they're people, people with lives.
And in order to be an effective doctor,
you need to treat people who have lives and not just disease.
In addition to which there's an enormous amount of back and forth,
mentoring of one student by another,
of all the students by the doctors,
and the result is a generation -- we hope -- of doctors
who do have time for the people they treat.
We'll see.
Each of them shows that it is possible
to build on and nurture character
and keep a profession
true to its proper mission --
what Aristotle would have called its proper telos.
And Ken and I believe
that this is what practitioners actually want.
People want to be allowed
to be virtuous.
They want to have permission to do the right thing.
They don't want to feel
like they need to take a shower
to get the moral grime off their bodies everyday
when they come home from work.
was the key to happiness,
and he was right.
There's now a lot of research being done in psychology
on what makes people happy,
and the two things that jump out in study after study --
I know this will come as a shock to all of you --
the two things that matter most to happiness
are love and work.
Love: managing successfully
relations with the people who are close to you
and with the communities of which you are a part.
Work: engaging in activities
that are meaningful and satisfying.
If you have that, good close relations with other people,
work that's meaningful and fulfilling,
you don't much need anything else.
you need wisdom.
Rules and incentives don't tell you
how to be a good friend, how to be a good parent,
how to be a good spouse,
or how to be a good doctor or a good lawyer
or a good teacher.
Rules and incentives
are no substitutes for wisdom.
Indeed, we argue,
there is no substitute for wisdom.
And so practical wisdom
does not require
heroic acts of self-sacrifice
on the part of practitioners.
In giving us the will and the skill
to do the right thing -- to do right by others --
practical wisdom also gives us
the will and the skill
to do right by ourselves.
but there's actually so many more,
I have two primary personalities
There was this equation in my family that went something like this:
So, looking for answers,
Now, see this strange,
They've made me a proud "I-don't-know-it-all."

She's worried.
She says, "Excuse me, I'm pissed off,
and I know a few things,
being an activist for the environment.
too small."
as if they were born with a "saint" gene.
from both sides of the political divide
here in the US:
"Liberalism is a Mental Disorder,"
"Pinheads and Patriots,"
"Arguing with Idiots."
They're supposedly tongue-in-cheek,
but they're actually dangerous.
Now here's a title that may sound familiar,
Who wrote that?
the book that launched the Nazi Party.

Now, if the idea of taking any of these people to lunch

that'll be your clue.
And what might happen at your lunch?
Probably not.
there is a field.
I'll meet you there."
If we look around us,
much of what surrounds us
started life as various rocks and sludge
buried in the ground in various places in the world.
But, of course, they don't look like rocks and sludge now.
They look like TV cameras, monitors,
annoying radio mics.
And so this magical transformation
is what I was trying to get at with my project,
which became known as the Toaster Project.
And it was also inspired by this quote
from Douglas Adams,
and the situation is from "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
And the situation it describes
is the hero of the book -- he's a 20th-century man --
finds himself alone on a strange planet
populated only by a technologically primitive people.
And he kind of assumes that, yes,
he'll become -- these villagers --
he'll become their emperor
and transform their society
with his wonderful command of technology
and science and the elements,
but, of course, realizes
that without the rest of human society,
he can barely make a sandwich,
let alone a toaster.
But he didn't have Wikipedia.
I'll try and make an electric toaster from scratch.
And, working on the idea
that the cheapest electric toaster
would also be the simplest to reverse-engineer,
I went and bought the cheapest toaster I could find,
took it home
and was kind of dismayed to discover
that, inside this object,
which I'd bought for just 3.49 pounds,
there were 400 different bits
made out of a hundred-plus different materials.
I didn't have the rest of my life to do this project.
I had maybe nine months.
So I thought, okay, I'll start with five.
And these were steel, mica,
plastic, copper and nickel.
I went and knocked on the door
of the Rio Tinto Chair
of Advanced Mineral Extraction at the Royal School of Mines
and said, "How do you make steel?"
And Professor Cilliers was very kind
and talked me through it.
And my vague rememberings from GCSE science --
well, steel comes from iron,
so I phoned up an iron mine.
And said, "Hi, I'm trying to make a toaster.
Can I come up and get some iron?"
Unfortunately, when I got there -- emerges Ray.
He had misheard me
and thought I was coming up because I was trying to make a poster,
and so wasn't prepared to take me into the mines.
But after some nagging, I got him to do that.
and that was produced
by sea creatures
350 million years ago
in a nice, warm,
sunny atmosphere.
When you study geology,
you can see what's happened in the past,
and there were terrific changes in the earth.
And of course, it wasn't actually a working mine anymore,
because, though Ray was a miner there,
the mine had closed
and had been reopened as a kind of tourist attraction,
because, of course, it can't compete
on the scale of operations which are happening
in South America, Australia, wherever.
But anyway, I got my suitcase of iron ore
and dragged it back to London on the train,
and then was faced with the problem:
Okay, how do you make this rock
into components for a toaster?
and he said, "Go to the library."
So I did
and was looking through the undergraduate textbooks on metallurgy --
completely useless for what I was trying to do.
Because, of course, they don't actually tell you how to do it
if you want to do it yourself and you don't have a smelting plant.
So I ended up going to the History of Science Library
and looking at this book.
This is the first textbook on metallurgy
written in the West, at least.
And there you can see that woodcut
is basically what I ended up doing.
But instead of a bellows, I had a leaf blower.
(Laughter)
And that was something that reoccurred throughout the project,
was, the smaller the scale you want to work on,
the further back in time you have to go.
And so this is after
a day and about half a night
smelting this iron.
I dragged out this stuff,
and it wasn't iron.
But luckily,
I found a patent online
for industrial furnaces that use microwaves,
and at 30 minutes at full power,
and I was able to finish off the process.
(Applause)
The next thing I was trying to get was copper.
Again, this mine
was once the largest copper mine in the world.
It's not anymore,
but I found a retired geology professor
to take me down,
and he said, "Okay, I'll let you have some water from the mine."
And the reason I was interested in getting water
is because water which goes through mines
becomes kind of acidic
and will start picking up,
dissolving the minerals from the mine.
And a good example of this is the Rio Tinto,
which is in Portugal.
As you can see, it's got lots and lots of minerals dissolved in it.
So many such
that it's now just a home for bacteria
who really like acidic, toxic conditions.
But anyway, the water I dragged back
from the Isle of Anglesey where the mine was --
there was enough copper in it
such that I could cast the pins
of my metal electric plug.
to get mica.
And mica is a mineral
which is a very good insulator
and very good at insulating electricity.
That's me getting mica.
And the last material I'm going to talk about today is plastic,
and, of course,
my toaster had to have a plastic case.
Plastic is the defining feature
of cheap electrical goods.
And so plastic comes from oil, so I phoned up BP
and spent a good half an hour
trying to convince the PR office at BP
that it would be fantastic for them
if they flew me to an oil rig
and let me have a jug of oil.
BP obviously has a bit more on their mind now.
But even then
they weren't convinced
and said, "Okay, we'll phone you back" -- never did.
So I looked at other ways of making plastic.
And you can actually make plastic
from obviously oils which come from plants, but also from starches.
So this is attempting to make
potato starch plastic.
And for a while that was looking really good.
I poured it into the mold, which you can see there,
which I've made from a tree trunk.
And it was looking good for a while,
but I left it outside, because you had to leave it outside to dry,
and unfortunately I came back
and there were snails eating the unhydrolyzed bits of potato.
I decided that I could think laterally.
And geologists have actually christened --
well, they're debating whether to christen --
the age that we're living in --
they're debating whether to make it a new geological epoch
called the Anthropocene, the age of Man.
And that's because geologists of the future
would kind of see a sharp shift
in the strata of rock that is being laid down now.
So suddenly, it will become kind of radioactive from Chernobyl
and the 2,000 or so nuclear bombs
that have been set off since 1945.
And there'd also be an extinction event --
like fossils would suddenly disappear.
And also, I thought
that there would be
synthetic polymers,
plastics, embedded in the rock.
so I decided that I could mine
some of this modern-day rock.
And I went up to Manchester
to visit a place called Axion Recycling.
And they're at the sharp end of what's called the WEEE,
which is this European electrical and electronic waste directive.
And that was brought into force
to try and deal with the mountain of stuff
that is just being made
and then living for a while in our homes
and then going to landfill.
But this is it.
of my toaster.
(Applause)
That's it without the case on.
And there it is on the shelves.
Thanks.
I don't know if you could see,
but I was never able to make insulation for the wires.
Kew Gardens were insistent
that I couldn't come and hack into their rubber tree.
So the wires were uninsulated.
So there was 240 volts
going through these homemade copper wires,
homemade plug.
And for about five seconds,
the toaster toasted,
but then, unfortunately,
the element kind of melted itself.
But I considered it a partial success, to be honest.
I would like to tell you all
that you are all actually cyborgs,
but not the cyborgs that you think.
You're not RoboCop, and you're not Terminator,
but you're cyborgs every time you look at a computer screen
or use one of your cell phone devices.
So what's a good definition for cyborg?
Well, traditional definition is "an organism
to which exogenous components have been added
for the purpose of adapting to new environments."
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel,
because, if you think about it, space is pretty awkward.
People aren't supposed to be there.
But humans are curious, and they like to add things to their bodies
so they can go to the Alps one day
and then become a fish in the sea the next.
Somebody goes to another country,
says, "How fascinating these people are, how interesting their tools are,
how curious their culture is."
And then they write a paper, and maybe a few other anthropologists read it,
and we think it's very exotic.
Well, what's happening
is that we've suddenly found a new species.
I, as a cyborg anthropologist, have suddenly said,
"Oh, wow. Now suddenly we're a new form of Homo sapiens,
and look at these fascinating cultures,
and look at these curious rituals
that everybody's doing around this technology.
They're clicking on things and staring at screens."
versus traditional anthropology.
And the reason is that tool use,
in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years,
everything has been a physical modification of self.
It has helped us to extend our physical selves,
go faster, hit things harder,
and there's been a limit on that.
But now what we're looking at is not an extension of the physical self,
but an extension of the mental self,
and because of that, we're able to travel faster,
communicate differently.
And the other thing that happens
is that we're all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology.
We can put anything we want into it, and it doesn't get heavier,
and then we can take anything out.
What does the inside of your computer actually look like?
Well, if you print it out, it looks like a thousand pounds of material
that you're carrying around all the time.
And if you actually lose that information,
it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind,
that you suddenly feel like something's missing,
except you aren't able to see it, so it feels like a very strange emotion.
Whether you like it or not, you're starting to show up online,
and people are interacting with your second self
when you're not there.
And so you have to be careful
about leaving your front lawn open,
which is basically your Facebook wall,
so that people don't write on it in the middle of the night --
because it's very much the equivalent.
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self.
You have to present yourself in digital life
in a similar way that you would in your analog life.
So, in the same way that you wake up, take a shower and get dressed,
you have to learn to do that for your digital self.
And the problem is that a lot of people now,
especially adolescents,
have to go through two adolescences.
They have to go through their primary one, that's already awkward,
and then they go through their second self's adolescence,
and that's even more awkward
because there's an actual history
of what they've gone through online.
And anybody coming in new to technology
is an adolescent online right now,
and so it's very awkward,
and it's very difficult for them to do those things.
"I'm going to teach you about time and space in the future."
And I said, "Great."
And he said one day, "What's the shortest distance between two points?"
And I said, "Well, that's a straight line. You told me that yesterday."
I thought I was very clever.
He said, "No, no, no. Here's a better way."
He took a piece of paper,
drew A and B on one side and the other
and folded them together so where A and B touched.
And he said, "That is the shortest distance between two points."
And I said, "Dad, dad, dad, how do you do that?"
He said, "Well, you just bend time and space,
it takes an awful lot of energy,
and that's just how you do it."
And I said, "I want to do that."
And he said, "Well, okay."
And so, when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years,
I was thinking at night,
"I want to be the first person to create a wormhole,
to make things accelerate faster.
And I want to make a time machine."
I was always sending messages to my future self
using tape recorders.
is that technology doesn't just get adopted
because it works.
It gets adopted because people use it
and it's made for humans.
So I started studying anthropology.
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones,
I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets.
They weren't physically transporting themselves;
they were mentally transporting themselves.
They would click on a button,
and they would be connected as A to B immediately.
And I thought, "Oh, wow. I found it. This is great."
have compressed because of this.
You can stand on one side of the world,
whisper something and be heard on the other.
One of the other ideas that comes around
is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use.
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time.
And because of that, you start to dig around
for your external memories -- where did you leave them?
So now we're all these paleontologists
that are digging for things that we've lost
on our external brains that we're carrying around in our pockets.
And that incites a sort of panic architecture --
"Oh no, where's this thing?"
We're all "I Love Lucy" on a great assembly line of information,
and we can't keep up.
when we bring all that into the social space,
we end up checking our phones all the time.
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy.
It's not that we're always connected to everybody,
but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want.
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone,
the room would be very crowded.
These are the people that you have access to right now, in general --
all of these people, all of your friends and family that you can connect to.
One I'm really worried about
is that people aren't taking time for mental reflection anymore,
and that they aren't slowing down and stopping,
being around all those people in the room all the time
that are trying to compete for their attention
on the simultaneous time interfaces,
paleontology and panic architecture.
They're not just sitting there.
And really, when you have no external input,
that is a time when there is a creation of self,
when you can do long-term planning,
when you can try and figure out who you really are.
And then, once you do that, you can figure out
how to present your second self in a legitimate way,
instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in --
and oh, I have to do this, and I have to do this, and I have to do this.
And so this is very important.
I'm really worried that, especially kids today,
they're not going to be dealing with this down-time,
that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture,
and that everything comes to them,
and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it.
It has its own external prosthetic devices,
and these devices are helping us all
to communicate and interact with each other.
But when you actually visualize it,
all the connections that we're doing right now --
this is an image of the mapping of the Internet --
it doesn't look technological.
It actually looks very organic.
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity
that we've connected in this way.
And it's not that machines are taking over.
It's that they're helping us to be more human,
helping us to connect with each other.
and helps us live our lives.
And really,
it ends up being more human than technology,
because we're co-creating each other all the time.
And so this is the important point that I like to study:
that things are beautiful, that it's still a human connection --
it's just done in a different way.
We're just increasing our humanness
and our ability to connect with each other, regardless of geography.
So that's why I study cyborg anthropology.
So the Awesome story:
It begins about 40 years ago,
when my mom and my dad came to Canada.
My mom left Nairobi, Kenya.
My dad left a small village outside of Amritsar, India.
And they got here in the late 1960s.
They settled in a shady suburb about an hour east of Toronto,
and they settled into a new life.
They saw their first dentist,
they ate their first hamburger,
and they had their first kids.
My sister and I
grew up here,
and we had quiet, happy childhoods.
We had close family,
good friends, a quiet street.
We grew up taking for granted
a lot of the things that my parents couldn't take for granted
when they grew up --
things like power always on
in our houses,
things like schools across the street
and hospitals down the road
and popsicles in the backyard.
We grew up, and we grew older.
I went to high school.
I graduated.
I moved out of the house, I got a job,
I found a girl, I settled down --
and I realize it sounds like a bad sitcom or a Cat Stevens' song --
Life was pretty good.
2006 was a great year.
Under clear blue skies in July in the wine region of Ontario,
I got married,
surrounded by 150 family and friends.
2007 was a great year.
I graduated from school,
and I went on a road trip with two of my closest friends.
Here's a picture of me and my friend, Chris,
on the coast of the Pacific Ocean.
We actually saw seals out of our car window,
and we pulled over to take a quick picture of them
and then blocked them with our giant heads.
(Laughter)
So you can't actually see them,
but it was breathtaking,
believe me.
I know that they were tougher for a lot of people,
not just me.
First of all, the news was so heavy.
It's still heavy now, and it was heavy before that,
but when you flipped open a newspaper, when you turned on the TV,
it was about ice caps melting,
wars going on around the world,
earthquakes, hurricanes
and an economy that was wobbling on the brink of collapse,
and then eventually did collapse,
and so many of us losing our homes,
or our jobs,
or our retirements,
or our livelihoods.
2008, 2009 were heavy years for me for another reason, too.
I was going through a lot of personal problems at the time.
My marriage wasn't going well,
and we just were growing further and further apart.
One day my wife came home from work
and summoned the courage, through a lot of tears,
to have a very honest conversation.
And she said, "I don't love you anymore,"
and it was one of the most painful things I'd ever heard
and certainly the most heartbreaking thing I'd ever heard,
until only a month later,
when I heard something even more heartbreaking.
had been battling mental illness for some time.
And for those of you
whose lives have been touched by mental illness,
you know how challenging it can be.
I spoke to him on the phone at 10:30 p.m.
on a Sunday night.
We talked about the TV show we watched that evening.
And Monday morning, I found out that he disappeared.
Very sadly, he took his own life.
And it was a really heavy time.
and I was finding it really, really difficult
to think of anything good,
I said to myself that I really needed a way
to focus on the positive somehow.
So I came home from work one night,
and I logged onto the computer,
and I started up a tiny website
called 1000awesomethings.com.
I was trying to remind myself
of the simple, universal, little pleasures that we all love,
but we just don't talk about enough --
things like waiters and waitresses
who bring you free refills without asking,
being the first table to get called up
to the dinner buffet at a wedding,
wearing warm underwear from just out of the dryer,
or when cashiers open up a new check-out lane at the grocery store
and you get to be first in line --
even if you were last at the other line, swoop right in there.
I started putting myself in a better mood.
I mean, 50,000 blogs
are started a day,
and so my blog was just one of those 50,000.
And nobody read it except for my mom.
Although I should say that my traffic did skyrocket
and go up by 100 percent
when she forwarded it to my dad.
(Laughter)
And then I got excited
when it started getting tens of hits,
and then I started getting excited when it started getting dozens
and then hundreds and then thousands
and then millions.
It started getting bigger and bigger and bigger.
And then I got a phone call,
and the voice at the other end of the line said,
"You've just won the Best Blog In the World award."
I was like, that sounds totally fake.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Which African country do you want me to wire all my money to?
(Laughter)
But it turns out, I jumped on a plane,
and I ended up walking a red carpet
between Sarah Silverman and Jimmy Fallon and Martha Stewart.
And I went onstage to accept a Webby award for Best Blog.
And the surprise
and just the amazement of that
was only overshadowed by my return to Toronto,
when, in my inbox,
10 literary agents were waiting for me
to talk about putting this into a book.
Flash-forward to the next year
and "The Book of Awesome" has now been
number one on the bestseller list for 20 straight weeks.
I said I wanted to tell you the Awesome story,
I wanted to share with you the three As of Awesome,
and I wanted to leave you with a closing thought.
So let's talk about those three As.
Over the last few years,
I haven't had that much time to really think.
But lately I have had the opportunity to take a step back
and ask myself: "What is it over the last few years
that helped me grow my website,
but also grow myself?"
And I've summarized those things, for me personally,
as three As.
They are Attitude, Awareness
and Authenticity.
I'd love to just talk about each one briefly.
Look, we're all going to get lumps,
and we're all going to get bumps.
None of us can predict the future, but we do know one thing about it
and that's that it ain't gonna go according to plan.
We will all have high highs
and big days and proud moments
of smiles on graduation stages,
father-daughter dances at weddings
and healthy babies screeching in the delivery room,
but between those high highs,
we may also have some lumps and some bumps too.
It's sad, and it's not pleasant to talk about,
but your husband might leave you,
your girlfriend could cheat,
your headaches might be more serious than you thought,
or your dog could get hit by a car on the street.
It's not a happy thought,
but your kids could get mixed up in gangs
or bad scenes.
Your mom could get cancer,
your dad could get mean.
And there are times in life
when you will be tossed in the well, too,
with twists in your stomach and with holes in your heart,
and when that bad news washes over you,
and when that pain sponges and soaks in,
I just really hope you feel
like you've always got two choices.
One, you can swirl and twirl
and gloom and doom forever,
or two, you can grieve
and then face the future
with newly sober eyes.
Having a great attitude is about choosing option number two,
and choosing, no matter how difficult it is,
no matter what pain hits you,
choosing to move forward and move on
and take baby steps into the future.
I love hanging out with three year-olds.
I love the way that they see the world,
because they're seeing the world for the first time.
I love the way that they can stare at a bug crossing the sidewalk.
I love the way that they'll stare slack-jawed
at their first baseball game
with wide eyes and a mitt on their hand,
soaking in the crack of the bat and the crunch of the peanuts
and the smell of the hotdogs.
I love the way that they'll spend hours picking dandelions in the backyard
and putting them into a nice centerpiece
for Thanksgiving dinner.
I love the way that they see the world,
because they're seeing the world
for the first time.
Having a sense of awareness
is just about embracing your inner three year-old.
Because you all used to be three years old.
That three-year-old boy is still part of you.
That three-year-old girl is still part of you.
They're in there.
And being aware is just about remembering
that you saw everything you've seen
for the first time once, too.
So there was a time when it was your first time ever
hitting a string of green lights on the way home from work.
There was the first time you walked by the open door of a bakery
and smelt the bakery air,
or the first time you pulled a 20-dollar bill out of your old jacket pocket
and said, "Found money."
And for this one, I want to tell you a quick story.
Let's go all the way back to 1932
when, on a peanut farm in Georgia,
a little baby boy named Roosevelt Grier was born.
Roosevelt Grier, or Rosey Grier, as people used to call him,
grew up and grew into
a 300-pound, six-foot-five linebacker in the NFL.
He's number 76 in the picture.
Here he is pictured with the "fearsome foursome."
These were four guys on the L.A. Rams in the 1960s
you did not want to go up against.
They were tough football players doing what they love,
which was crushing skulls
and separating shoulders on the football field.
But Rosey Grier also had
another passion.
In his deeply authentic self,
he also loved needlepoint. (Laughter)
He loved knitting.
He said that it calmed him down, it relaxed him,
it took away his fear of flying and helped him meet chicks.
That's what he said.
I mean, he loved it so much that, after he retired from the NFL,
he started joining clubs.
And he even put out a book
called "Rosey Grier's Needlepoint for Men."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's a great cover.
If you notice, he's actually needlepointing his own face.
is that Rosey Grier
is just such an authentic person,
and that's what authenticity is all about.
It's just about being you and being cool with that.
And I think when you're authentic,
you end up following your heart,
and you put yourself in places
and situations and in conversations
that you love and that you enjoy.
You meet people that you like talking to.
You go places you've dreamt about.
And you end you end up following your heart
and feeling very fulfilled.
So those are the three A's.
to my parents coming to Canada.
I don't know what it would feel like
coming to a new country when you're in your mid-20s.
I don't know, because I never did it,
but I would imagine that it would take a great attitude.
I would imagine that you'd have to be pretty aware of your surroundings
and appreciating the small wonders
that you're starting to see in your new world.
And I think you'd have to be really authentic,
you'd have to be really true to yourself
in order to get through what you're being exposed to.
for about 10 seconds right now,
because you don't get many opportunities in life to do something like this,
and my parents are sitting in the front row.
So I wanted to ask them to, if they don't mind, stand up.
And I just wanted to say thank you to you guys.
of his first day in Canada.
And it's a great story, because what happened was
he got off the plane at the Toronto airport,
and he was welcomed by a non-profit group,
which I'm sure someone in this room runs.
(Laughter)
And this non-profit group had a big welcoming lunch
for all the new immigrants to Canada.
And my dad says he got off the plane and he went to this lunch
and there was this huge spread.
There was bread, there was those little, mini dill pickles,
there was olives, those little white onions.
There was rolled up turkey cold cuts,
rolled up ham cold cuts, rolled up roast beef cold cuts
and little cubes of cheese.
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches
and salmon salad sandwiches.
There was lasagna, there was casseroles,
there was brownies, there was butter tarts,
and there was pies, lots and lots of pies.
And when my dad tells the story, he says,
"The craziest thing was, I'd never seen any of that before, except bread.
(Laughter)
I didn't know what was meat, what was vegetarian.
I was eating olives with pie.
(Laughter)
I just couldn't believe how many things you can get here."
my dad used to take me grocery shopping,
and he would stare in wonder
at the little stickers that are on the fruits and vegetables.
He would say, "Look, can you believe they have a mango here from Mexico?
They've got an apple here from South Africa.
Can you believe they've got a date from Morocco?"
He's like, "Do you know where Morocco even is?"
And I'd say, "I'm five. I don't even know where I am.
Is this A&P?"
And he'd say, "I don't know where Morocco is either, but let's find out."
And so we'd buy the date, and we'd go home.
And we'd actually take an atlas off the shelf,
and we'd flip through until we found this mysterious country.
And when we did, my dad would say,
"Can you believe someone climbed a tree over there,
picked this thing off it, put it in a truck,
drove it all the way to the docks
and then sailed it all the way
across the Atlantic Ocean
and then put it in another truck
and drove that all the way to a tiny grocery store just outside our house,
so they could sell it to us for 25 cents?"
And I'd say, "I don't believe that."
And he's like, "I don't believe it either.
Things are amazing. There's just so many things to be happy about."
There are so many things to be happy about.
We are the only species
on the only life-giving rock
in the entire universe that we've ever seen,
capable of experiencing
so many of these things.
I mean, we're the only ones with architecture and agriculture.
We're the only ones with jewelry and democracy.
We've got airplanes, highway lanes,
interior design and horoscope signs.
We've got fashion magazines, house party scenes.
You can watch a horror movie with monsters.
You can go to a concert and hear guitars jamming.
We've got books, buffets and radio waves,
wedding brides and rollercoaster rides.
You can sleep in clean sheets.
You can go to the movies and get good seats.
You can smell bakery air, walk around with rain hair,
pop bubble wrap or take an illegal nap.
but we've only got 100 years to enjoy it.
And that's the sad part.
The cashiers at your grocery store,
the foreman at your plant,
the guy tailgating you home on the highway,
the telemarketer calling you during dinner,
every teacher you've ever had,
everyone that's ever woken up beside you,
every politician in every country,
every actor in every movie,
every single person in your family, everyone you love,
everyone in this room and you
will be dead in a hundred years.
Life is so great that we only get such a short time
to experience and enjoy
all those tiny little moments that make it so sweet.
And that moment is right now,
and those moments are counting down,
and those moments are always, always, always fleeting.
And that's why I believe that if you live your life
with a great attitude,
choosing to move forward and move on
whenever life deals you a blow,
living with a sense of awareness of the world around you,
embracing your inner three year-old
and seeing the tiny joys that make life so sweet
and being authentic to yourself,
being you and being cool with that,
letting your heart lead you and putting yourself in experiences that satisfy you,
then I think you'll live a life
that is rich and is satisfying,
and I think you'll live a life that is truly awesome.
There are two groups of women
when it comes to screening mammography --
women in whom mammography works very well
and has saved thousands of lives
and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.
Do you know which group you're in?
If you don't, you're not alone.
Because the breast has become
a very political organ.
The truth has become lost
in all the rhetoric
coming from the press, politicians,
radiologists
and medical imaging companies.
I will do my best this morning
to tell you what I think is the truth.
But first, my disclosures.
I am not a breast cancer survivor.
I'm not a radiologist.
I don't have any patents,
and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,
and I am not seeking your vote.
is a doctor of internal medicine
who became passionately interested in this topic
about 10 years ago
when a patient asked me a question.
She came to see me
after discovering a breast lump.
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer
in her 40s.
She and I were both very pregnant at that time,
and my heart just ached for her,
imagining how afraid she must be.
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.
But she asked me a question:
how confident was I
that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram
if she developed one?
So I studied her mammogram,
and I reviewed the radiology literature,
and I was shocked to discover
that, in her case,
our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram
were less than the toss of a coin.
when a firestorm erupted
after the United States Preventive Services Task Force
reviewed the world's mammography screening literature
and issued a guideline
recommending against screening mammograms
in women in their 40s.
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,
even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar
with the mammography studies.
It took the Senate just 17 days
to ban the use of the guidelines
in determining insurance coverage.
Radiologists were outraged
by the guidelines.
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States
issued the following quote
to the Washington Post.
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized
for protecting their own financial self-interest.
But in my view,
the radiologists are heroes.
There's a shortage of radiologists
qualified to read mammograms,
and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex
of all radiology studies to interpret,
and because radiologists
are sued more often
over missed breast cancer
than any other cause.
But that very fact is telling.
there is likely to be some fire.
The factor most responsible for that fire
is breast density.
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --
pictured here in yellow --
versus connective and epithelial tissues --
pictured in pink.
And that proportion
is primarily genetically determined.
Two-thirds of women in their 40s
have dense breast tissue,
which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.
And although breast density generally declines with age,
up to a third of women
retain dense breast tissue
for years after menopause.
Well, you need to read the details
of your mammography report.
Radiologists classify breast density
into four categories
based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,
that's called fatty-replaced.
The next category
is scattered fibroglandular densities,
followed by heterogeneously dense
and extremely dense.
And breasts that fall into these two categories
are considered dense.
The problem with breast density
is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.
Both tumors and dense breast tissue
appear white on a mammogram,
and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.
So it's easy to see this tumor
in the upper part of this fatty breast.
But imagine how difficult it would be
to find that tumor in this dense breast.
That's why mammograms find
over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,
but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.
makes it hard to find a cancer,
but it turns out
that it's also a powerful predictor
of your risk for breast cancer.
It's a stronger risk factor
than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.
At the time my patient posed this question to me,
breast density was an obscure topic
in the radiology literature,
and very few women having mammograms,
or the physicians ordering them,
knew about this.
But what else could I offer her?
and it's changed very little.
There have been surprisingly few innovations,
until digital mammography was approved
in 2000.
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,
but the images
can be stored and manipulated digitally,
just like we can with a digital camera.
The U.S. has invested
four billion dollars
converting to digital mammography equipment,
and what have we gained from that investment?
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,
digital mammography was found
to be no better over all
than traditional mammography,
and in fact, it was worse in older women.
But it was better in one group,
and that was women under 50
who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,
and in those women,
digital mammography found twice as many cancers,
but it still only found 60 percent.
So digital mammography
has been a giant leap forward
for manufacturers
of digital mammography equipment,
but it's been a very small step forward for
womankind.
Ultrasound generates more biopsies
that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,
so it's not widely used.
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,
but it's also very expensive.
If we think about disruptive technology,
we see an almost ubiquitous pattern
of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.
Think about iPods compared to stereos.
But it's the exact opposite in health care.
The machines get ever bigger
and ever more expensive.
Screening the average young woman with an MRI
is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.
It's just way too much equipment.
One MRI scan
costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact
that health care innovation
can't always come at a much higher price.
on innovation,
and he made the case that scientific discoveries
are rarely the product of one individual's genius.
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,
if you can simply gather
people with different perspectives in a room
and get them to talk about things
that they don't ordinarily talk about.
It's like the essence of TED.
He quotes one innovator who says,
"The only time a physician and a physicist get together
is when the physicist gets sick."
(Laughter)
This makes no sense,
because physicians have all kinds of problems
that they don't realize have solutions.
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things
that they don't realize are problems.
Now, take a look at this cartoon
that accompanied Gladwell's article,
and tell me if you see something disturbing
about this depiction of innovative thinkers.
I will tell you the story
of the serendipitous collision
of my patient's problem
with a physicist's solution.
Shortly after her visit,
I was introduced to a nuclear physicist
at Mayo
named Michael O'Conner,
who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,
something I had nothing to do with.
And he happened to tell me
about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,
where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time
to image the heart,
and it had even been tried to image the breast.
But the problem was
that the gamma detectors
were these huge, bulky tubes,
and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,
and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast
to find small tumors.
But the potential advantage was
that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,
are not influenced by breast density.
But this technology
could not find tumors when they're small,
and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.
If you can find a tumor
when it's less than a centimeter,
survival exceeds 90 percent,
but drops off rapidly
as tumor size increases.
But Michael told me about
a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,
and this is it.
It's made
not of a bulky tube,
but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material
that serves as the gamma detector.
And I started talking to him
about this problem with breast density,
and we realized that we might be able to get this detector
close enough around the breast
to actually find small tumors.
a grid of these cubes with tape --
(Laughter)
-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate
of a mammography machine
that was about to be thrown out,
and we attached the new detector,
and we decided to call this machine
Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.
This is an image from our first patient.
And you can see, using the old gamma technology,
that it just looked like noise.
But using our new detector,
we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.
an internist,
soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,
and two radiologists,
and we were trying to take on
the entrenched world of mammography
with a machine that was held together by duct tape.
To say that we faced
high doses of skepticism
in those early years
is just a huge understatement,
but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work
that we chipped away with incremental modifications
to this system.
This is our current detector.
And you can see that it looks a lot different.
The duct tape is gone,
and we added a second detector on top of the breast,
which has further improved our tumor detection.
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer
that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,
but not by normal cells,
and this is the key difference from mammography.
Mammography relies on differences
in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,
and we've seen that those differences
can be obscured in a dense breast.
But MBI exploits
the different molecular behavior of tumors,
and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.
After the injection,
the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.
And if you've ever had a mammogram --
if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --
you know what comes next:
pain.
You may be surprised to know
that mammography is the only radiologic study
that's regulated by federal law,
and the law requires
that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery
come down on your breast during this study.
But with MBI,
we use just light, pain-free compression.
(Applause)
And the detector
then transmits the image to the computer.
You can see, on the right, a mammogram
showing a faint tumor,
the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,
as well as a second tumor,
which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,
we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --
one is small as three millimeters.
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,
we used these images
to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.
And we were elated when they took a chance
on a team of completely unknown investigators
and funded us to study
1,000 women with dense breasts,
comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.
Of the tumors that we found,
mammography found
only 25 percent of those tumors.
MBI found 83 percent.
Here's an example from that screening study.
The digital mammogram was read as normal
and shows lots of dense tissue,
but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,
which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.
And in this case,
a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,
who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,
wanted to enroll in our study.
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,
but her MBI showed an area
of worrisome uptake,
which we can also see on a color image.
And this corresponded
to a tumor the size of a golf ball.
But fortunately it was removed
before it had spread to her lymph nodes.
could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,
we had to solve one very important problem.
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,
and we have spent the last three years
making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system
to allow this.
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation
that is equivalent to the effective dose
from one digital mammogram.
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,
and this image from three weeks ago
in a 67-year-old woman
shows a normal digital mammogram,
but an MBI image
showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.
It's also older women with dense tissue.
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose
that's used in any other type of gamma technology.
MRI generates over a thousand.
It takes a radiologist
years of specialty training
to become expert in differentiating
the normal anatomic detail
from the worrisome finding.
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room
can find the tumor on the MBI image.
But this is why MBI
is so potentially disruptive --
it's as accurate as MRI,
it's far less complex to interpret,
and it's a fraction of the cost.
But you can understand why there may be
forces in the breast-imaging world
who prefer the status quo.
our manuscript was rejected
by four journals.
After the fourth rejection,
we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,
because we strongly suspected
that one of the reviewers who had rejected it
had a financial conflict of interest
in a competing technology.
Our manuscript was then accepted
and will be published later this month
in the journal Radiology.
(Applause)
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,
and then our findings will need to be replicated
at other institutions,
and this could take five or more years.
If this technology is widely adopted,
I will not benefit financially in any way,
and that is very important to me,
because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.
But I recognize --
(Applause)
I recognize that the adoption of this technology
will depend as much on economic
and political forces
as it will on the soundness of the science.
but it's not yet widely available.
So until something is available
for women with dense breasts,
there are things that you should know
to protect yourself.
First, know your density.
Ninety percent of women don't,
and 95 percent of women don't know
that it increases your breast cancer risk.
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state
to mandate that women receive notification
of their breast density
after a mammogram.
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging
last week in Chicago,
and I was stunned that there was a heated debate
as to whether we should be telling women
what their breast density is.
Of course we should.
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor
or read the details of your mammography report.
Second, if you're pre-menopausal,
try to schedule your mammogram
in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,
when breast density is relatively lower.
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,
insist on additional imaging.
And fourth and most important,
the mammography debate will rage on,
but I do believe that all women 40 and older
should have an annual mammogram.
but it's the only test that's been proven
to reduce mortality from breast cancer.
But this mortality banner
is the very sword
which mammography's most ardent advocates use
to deter innovation.
Some women who develop breast cancer
die from it many years later,
and most women, thankfully, survive.
So it takes 10 or more years
for any screening method
to demonstrate a reduction
in mortality from breast cancer.
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough
to have a chance of making that claim.
It is time for us to accept
both the extraordinary successes of mammography
and the limitations.
We need to individualize screening
based on density.
For women without dense breasts,
mammography is the best choice.
But for women with dense breasts;
we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,
we need to offer them something better.
when my patient first asked me this question

and the answer has been so slow to come.
She's given me her blessing
to share this story with you.
After undergoing biopsies
that further increased her risk for cancer
and losing her sister to cancer,
she made the difficult decision
to have a prophylactic mastectomy.
We can and must do better,
not just in time for her granddaughters
and my daughters,
but in time for you.
and I have never had a patient tell me,
"I really want you to be creative during surgery,"
and so I guess there's a little bit of irony to it.
I will say though that, after having done surgery a lot,
And so I set out with this concept, scientifically,
just like we study any other complex neurologic process,
and there are subquestions that I put there.

over the next 10, 20, 30 years,
but to also take pictures of active areas of the brain.
The way that's done is by the following:
There's something called BOLD imaging,
that's aligning your molecules in certain areas.

I met with medical doctors, scientists,
and I'm here to tell you
sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol.
I was recently having dinner with a guy
Especially here in Washington, if you try to make a breakfast date,
and you say, "How about eight o'clock?"
because we, at the moment,
they might still be around.
what is good for us on a personal level,
is also what is best for the world.
I'm actually here
to make a challenge to people.
I know there have been many challenges made to people.
The one I'm going to make
is that it is time for us to reclaim
what peace really means.
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --
as lovely as they are.
When I see the symbols
of the rainbow and the dove,
I think of personal serenity.
I think of meditation.
I do not think
about what I consider to be peace,
which is sustainable peace
with justice and equality.
It is a sustainable peace
in which the majority of people
on this planet
have access to enough resources
to live dignified lives,
where these people have enough access
to education
and health care,
so that they can live in freedom from want
and freedom from fear.
This is called human security.
And I am not a complete pacifist
like some of my really, really heavy-duty,
non-violent friends,
like Mairead McGuire.
I understand that humans
are so "messed up" --
to use a nice word,
because I promised my mom
I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.
And I'm trying harder and harder.
Mom, I'm really trying.
we need a little bit of military,
but for defense.
We need to redefine
what makes us secure
in this world.
It is not arming our country
to the teeth.
It is not getting other countries
to arm themselves to the teeth
with the weapons that we produce
and we sell them.
It is using that money more rationally
to make the countries of the world secure,
to make the people of the world secure.
I was thinking about
the recent ongoings
in Congress,
where the president is offering
8.4 billion dollars
to try to get the START vote.
I certainly support the START vote.
But he's offering 84 billion dollars
for the modernizing
of nuclear weapons.
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about
for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals
is 80 billion dollars?
Just that little bit of money,
which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --
it's not, but ...
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.
But it's going to modernize weapons
we do not need
and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,
unless we get up off our ...
and take action to make it happen,
unless we begin to believe
that all of the things that we've been hearing about
in these last two days
are elements of what come together
to make human security.
It is saving the tigers.
It is stopping the tar sands.
It is having access
to medical equipment
that can actually tell who does have cancer.
It is all of those things.
It is using our money for all of those things.
It is about action.
a couple of weeks ago,
and His Holiness --
we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,
and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,
and he leans over to me, and he says,
"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.
Your robe gives it away."
(Laughter)
He said, "You know
that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."
I said, "That's good. That's good.
We need that in the world.
I don't follow that, but that's cool."
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.
I do not believe
that meditation and prayer
will change this world.
I think what we need
is action."
His Holiness, in his robes,
is my new action hero.
a couple of days ago.
As most of you know,
she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.
You probably also know
that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years
imprisoned for her efforts
to bring about democracy.
She was just released a couple of weeks ago,
and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,
because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,
agitating for change.
She is already out in the streets, working with the party
to try to rebuild it.
But I talked to her for a range of issues.
But one thing that I want to say,
because it's similar to what His Holiness said.
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go
to finally get democracy in my country.
But I don't believe in hope
without endeavor.
I don't believe in the hope of change,
unless we take action
to make it so."
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,
the first Muslim woman
to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.
She has been in exile
for the last year and a half.
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?
She says the airports of the world.
She is traveling because she was out of the country
at the time of the elections.
And instead of going home,
she conferred with all the other women that she works with,
who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.
We need to be able to talk to you out there,
so that you can give the message
of what's happening here."
A year and a half --
she's out speaking
on behalf of the other women in her country.

They call her the "Tree Lady,"
but she's more than the Tree Lady.
Working for peace
is very creative.
It's hard work every day.
When she was planting those trees,
I don't think most people understand
that, at the same time,
she was using the action
of getting people together to plant those trees
to talk about how to overcome
the authoritarian government in her country.
People could not gather
without getting busted and taken to jail.
But if they were together planting trees for the environment,
it was okay --
creativity.
But it's not just iconic women
like Shirin,
like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --
it is other women in the world
who are also struggling together
to change this world.
11 individual organizations of Burmese women
came together because there's strength in numbers.
Working together is what changes our world.

another one comes out and joins the movement,

they will ultimately bring change

Betty Williams on the right-hand side --
bringing peace to Northern Ireland.
I'll tell you the quick story.
An IRA driver was shot,
and his car plowed into people
on the side of the street.
There was a mother and three children.
The children were killed on the spot.
It was Mairead's sister.
Instead of giving in
to grief, depression, defeat
in the face of that violence,
Mairead hooked up with Betty --
a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --
and they took to the streets
to say, "No more violence."
And they were able to get
tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,
in the streets to bring about change.
And they have been
part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,
and they're still working on it,
because there's still a lot more to do.
She also received the Peace Prize.
She is now running for president.
She is educating the indigenous people of her country
about what it means to be a democracy,
about how you bring democracy to the country,
about educating, about how to vote --
but that democracy is not just about voting;
it's about being an active citizen.
the landmine campaign.
One of the things that made this campaign work
is because we grew from two NGOs
to thousands
in 90 countries around the world,
working together in common cause to ban landmines.
Some of the people who worked in our campaign
could only work maybe an hour a month.
They could maybe volunteer that much.
There were others, like myself,
who were full-time.
But it was the actions, together, of all of us
that brought about that change.
is people getting up
and taking action
to reclaim the meaning of peace.
It's not a dirty word.
It's hard work every single day.
And if each of us
who cares about the different things we care about
got up off our butts
and volunteered
as much time as we could,
we would change this world,
we would save this world.
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.

after your mammogram.
Because about five of my friends were like,
"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.
Don't bring your measuring stick."
And she said, "How are you?"
And this is a therapist who sees therapists,
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."

It was a slugfest.

and spent the next couple of years
really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted,

This is the world we live in.
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research --
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.
I don't want to feel these.
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.

A way to discharge pain and discomfort.
Let me tell you what we think about children.
They're hardwired for struggle when they get here.
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand,
"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle,
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.
where career choices for women were so limited.
And if you're in this room today,
And the problem is this:
anywhere in the world.
Of all the people in parliament in the world,
13 percent are women.
C-level jobs, board seats --
tops out at 15, 16 percent.
And even in the non-profit world,
women at the top: 20 percent.
which is that women face harder choices
between professional success and personal fulfillment.

"Yeah. Or maybe you're the only one who had to go to the bathroom."
Now people talk about this a lot,
even though that's all really important.
What are the messages we tell the women that work with and for us?
What are the messages we tell our daughters?
I don't have the right answer.
I left San Francisco, where I live, on Monday,

women systematically underestimate their own abilities.
If you test men and women,
Women do not negotiate for themselves in the workforce.
A study in the last two years
are negotiating their first salary,
and only seven percent of women.
And most importantly,
men attribute their success to themselves,
and women attribute it to other external factors.
If you ask men why they did a good job,
they'll say, "I'm awesome.
Obviously. Why are you even asking?"
If you ask women why they did a good job,
what they'll say is someone helped them,
they got lucky, they worked really hard.
Boy, it matters a lot.
Because no one gets to the corner office
or they don't even understand their own success.
But it's not that simple.
Because what the data shows, above all else, is one thing,
and negatively correlated for women.
There's a famous Harvard Business School study
on a woman named Heidi Roizen.
and she uses her contacts
to become a very successful venture capitalist.
In 2002 -- not so long ago --
a professor who was then at Columbia University
took that case and made it [Howard] Roizen.
He changed exactly one word:
"Heidi" to "Howard."
But that one word made a really big difference.
and the good news was the students, both men and women,
thought Heidi and Howard were equally competent,
and that's good.
She's a little out for herself. She's a little political.
This is the complication.
We have to tell our daughters and our colleagues,
and we have to do it in a world
where, for them, there are sacrifices they will make for that,
even though for their brothers, there are not.
I gave this talk at Facebook not so long ago
She said, "You're giving this talk,
and you said you would take two more questions.
"Wow, if it's me -- who cares about this, obviously --

to contribute fully in the workforce or at home,
Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate
about the African wilderness
and protecting the African wilderness,
and so what we've done
is we've focused on iconic cats.
And I know,
in the light of human suffering and poverty
and even climate change,
one would wonder,
why worry about a few cats?
Well today we're here
to share with you a message that we have learned
from a very important and special character --
this leopard.
like a super long episode of "CSI" --
something like 28 years.
In essence, what we've done
is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,
we've seen over 2,000 kills
by these amazing animals.
But one of the things that science really lets us down on
is that personality,
that individual personality that these animals have.
And here's a prime example.
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old
baobab tree in Africa,
the same tree that we found her mother in
and her grandmother.
And she took us on a journey
and revealed something very special to us --
her own daughter, eight days old.
And the minute we found this leopard,
we realized that we needed to move in,
and so we basically stayed with this leopard
for the next four-and-a-half years --
following her every day,
getting to know her,
that individual personality of hers,
and really coming to know her.
Now I'm destined
to spend a lot of time
with some unique,
very, very special,
individualistic
and often seductive female characters.
(Laughter)
Beverly's clearly one of them,
and this little leopard, Legadema, is another,
and she changed our lives.
in fact, more time than even her mother did.
When her mother would go off hunting,
we would stay and film.
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree
20 paces away from us.
It was frightening,
and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.
And of course, we were stunned for a while,
but when we managed to get our wits about us,
we looked at it and said, "My gosh,
what's going to happen with that little cub?
She's probably going to forever associate
that deafening crash with us."
Well, we needn't have worried.
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,
sat next to us, shivering,
with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.
And actually from that day on,
she's been comfortable with us.
So we felt that that day
was the day that she really earned her name.
We called her Legadema,
which means, "light from the sky."
in all sorts of animals,
in particular in the cats.
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,
"he who greets with fire,"
and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.
But only by getting up close to these animals
and spending time with them
can we actually even reach out
and dig out these personal characters that they have.
we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta
in Botswana.
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,
but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.
But also, our hearts are in our throats
a huge amount of the time,
because we're driving through water,
and it's an unknown territory.
But we're really there
seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.
everybody knows that cats hate water,
and so this was a real revelation for us.
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,
by going where no sane person should go --
not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --
and just pushing the envelope,
going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.
But we've managed to find that these lions
are 15 percent bigger than any others,
and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.
is knowing when to turn around.
We don't always get that right,
and on this particular day,
we seriously underestimated the depth.
We got deeper and deeper,
until it was at Dereck's chest-height.
Well then we hit a deep depression,
and we seriously submerged the vehicle.
We actually managed to drown
two million dollars' worth of camera gear.
We drowned our pride, I must tell you,
which was really serious,
and we seized the engine.
is that he who drowns the vehicle
gets to swim with the crocodiles.
(Laughter)
You will notice also that all of these images here
are taken from the top angle by Beverly --
the dry top angle, by the way.
(Laughter)
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,
and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.
spend day and night
trying to capture unique footage.
And 20 years ago,
we did a film called "Eternal Enemies"
where we managed to capture
this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --
lions and hyenas.
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.
And we can only work that out
as people were seeing parallels
between the thuggish side of nature
and gang warfare.
is doing exactly what his name,
Eetwidomayloh, represents.
He's focused on this hyena,
and he is going to get it.
(Animal sounds)
But that's, I think, what this is all about,
is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,
but we live by certain rules of engagement,
which mean we can't interfere.
This sort of behavior has been going on
for three, four, five million years,
and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."
But that's not always easy for us.
we have to work through extremes --
extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.
Sleep deprivation is extreme.
We're on the edge
through a large part of the time.
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture
lions and elephants together --
and never ever managed
until this particular night.
And I have to tell you
that it was a disturbing night for me.
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.
I was shaking with anxiety,
but I knew that [I had] to capture something
that had never been seen before, had never been documented.
And I do believe you should stay with us.
and this is probably a highlight of our career --
is that you never know how it's going to end.
Many people believe, in fact,
that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,
not in the lungs,
and that's when people give up hope,
or when any life form gives up hope.
And you can see the start of it here.
This elephant, against overwhelming odds,
simply gives up hope.
But by the same token,
you can get your hope back again.
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens,
some spark gets into you,
some sort of will to fight --
that iron will that we all have,
that this elephant has,
that conservation has, that big cats have.
Everything has that will to survive,
to fight, to push through that mental barrier
and to keep going.
And for us, in many ways,
this elephant has become
a symbol of inspiration for us,
a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.
We were spending so much time with this leopard
and getting to understand her individualism,
her personal character,
that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.
We were perhaps taking her for granted,
and maybe she didn't like that that much.
This is about couples working together,
and so I do need to say that within the vehicle
we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.
Beverly sits on the one side
where all her camera gear is,
and I'm on the other side where my space is.
These are precious to us, these divides.
that I had vacated my seat
and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,
she came in like a curious cat
to come and investigate.
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful
that she trusted us to that extent.
But at the same time, we were concerned
that if she created this as a habit
and jumped into somebody else's car,
it might not turn out the same way --
she might get shot for that.
So we knew we had to react quickly.
And the only way we thought we could
without scaring her
is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --
a hiss and a sound.
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --
very innovative.
because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.
(Laughter)
But really and truly, this was how
this little leopard was displaying
her individual personality.
But nothing prepared us
for what happened next in our relationship with her,
when she started hunting.
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.
We felt like we were surrogate parents.
And of course, we knew now
that she was going to survive.
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon
clinging to the mother's fur
did we realize that something very unique
was taking place here with Legadema.
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,
it didn't turn and run.
So what we watched
over the next couple of hours
was very unique.
It was absolutely amazing
when she picked it up to safety,
protecting it from the hyena.
And over the next five hours,
she took care of it.
We realized that we actually don't know everything,
and that nature is so unpredictable,
we have to be open at all times.
(Laughter)
But in fact,
what we were seeing here was interesting.
Because she is a cub wanting to play,
but she was also a predator needing to kill,
and yet conflicted in some way,
because she was also an emerging mother.
She had this maternal instinct,
much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,
and so this really took us to this new level
of understanding that personality.
They ended up sleeping for hours.
But I have to tell you --
everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"
It did die,
and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.
we had very, very firm ideas
on what conservation meant.
We had to deal with these individual personalities.
We had to deal with them with respect
and celebrate them.
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative
to march forward into conservation,
taking care of the big cats that we loved --
and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years
to see how well we had all collectively been doing.
So when Beverly and I were born,
there were 450,000 lions,
and today there are 20,000.
Tigers haven't fared any better --
45,000
down to maybe 3,000.
all the way down to 12,000.
Leopards have plummeted
from 700,000
down to a mere 50,000.
Now in the extraordinary time
that we have worked with Legadema --
which is really over a five-year period --
10,000 leopards were legally shot
by safari hunters.
And that's not the only leopards
that were being killed through that period.
There's an immense amount of poaching as well,
and so possibly the same amount.
It's simply not sustainable.
We admire them,
and we fear them,
and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.
It used to be the time
where only kings wore a leopard skin,
but now throughout rituals and ceremonies,
traditional healers and ministers.
And of course, looking at this lion paw
that has been skinned,
it eerily reminds me
of a human hand,
and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,
and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry
is going to wipe out all the tigers.
So we have a real problem here,
no more so than the lions do, the male lions.
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw
is actually a red herring,
because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,
and they all are actually
infected with the same disease.
I call it complacency --
our complacency.
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on
that we're all aware of, that we condone.
And that's probably because we haven't seen it
like we are today.
that, when a male lion is killed,
it completely disrupts the whole pride.
A new male comes into the area
and takes over the pride,
and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs
and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.
So we've estimated
that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed
when one lion is hanging on a wall
somewhere in a far-off place.
is that these lions are essential.
They're essential to the habitat.
If they disappear,
whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year
ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.
So this is not just a concern about lions;
it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.
If they disappear, all of that goes away.
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways
is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,
as we de-link ourselves spiritually
from these animals,
we lose hope,
we lose that spiritual connection,
our dignity, that thing within us
that keeps us connected to the planet.
of lions and leopards right now,
it is all about critical awareness.
And so what we are doing,
in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"
and "The Last Lion" is exactly
what is happening right now.
That is the situation we're in --
the last lions.
That is, if we don't take action and do something,
these plains will be completely devoid
of big cats,
and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.
And simply, if we can't protect them,
we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.
and designed our lives by --
that conservation was all about respect
and celebration --
is probably true. That's really what it needs.
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other
as a man and a woman, as a community
and as part of this planet,
and we need to continue that.
Well we can report, in fact,
that we're grandparents.
So today I'm going to talk to you
about the rise of collaborative consumption.
I'm going to explain what it is
and try and convince you -- in just 15 minutes --
that this isn't a flimsy idea,
or a short-term trend,
but a powerful cultural and economic force
reinventing not just what we consume,
but how we consume.
Hands up -- how many of you
have books, CDs, DVDs, or videos
lying around your house
that you probably won't use again,
but you can't quite bring yourself to throw away?
Can't see all the hands,
but it looks like all of you, right?
On our shelves at home,
we have a box set of the DVD series "24,"
season six to be precise.
I think it was bought for us around three years ago for a Christmas present.
Now my husband, Chris, and I
love this show.
But let's face it, when you've watched it once maybe, or twice,
you don't really want to watch it again,
because you know how Jack Bauer is going to defeat the terrorists.
So there it sits on our shelves
obsolete to us,
but with immediate latent value to someone else.
Now before we go on, I have a confession to make.
I lived in New York for 10 years,
and I am a big fan of "Sex and the City."
Now I'd love to watch the first movie again
as sort of a warm-up to the sequel coming out next week.
So how easily could I swap
our unwanted copy of "24"
for a wanted copy of "Sex and the City?"
Now you may have noticed
there's a new sector emerging called swap-trading.
Now the easiest analogy for swap-trading
is like an online dating service
for all your unwanted media.
What it does is use the Internet
to create an infinite marketplace
to match person A's "haves"
with person C's "wants,"
whatever they may be.
appropriately called Swaptree,
and there were over 59,300 items
that I could instantly swap
for my copy of "24."
Lo and behold,
there in Reseda, CA was Rondoron
who wanted swap his or her
"like new" copy of "Sex and the City"
for my copy of "24."
So in other words, what's happening here
is that Swaptree
solves my carrying company's sugar rush problem,
a problem the economists call "the coincidence of wants,"
in approximately 60 seconds.
What's even more amazing is it will print out a postage label on the spot,
because it knows the way of the item.
Now there are layers of technical wonder
behind sites such as Swaptree,
but that's not my interest,
and nor is swap trading, per se.
dedicated to researching,
is the collaborative behaviors and trust-mechanics
inherent in these systems.
When you think about it,
it would have seemed like a crazy idea, even a few years ago,
that I would swap my stuff with a total stranger
whose real name I didn't know
and without any money changing hands.
Yet 99 percent of trades on Swaptree
happen successfully,
and the one percent that receive a negative rating,
it's for relatively minor reasons,
like the item didn't arrive on time.
An extremely powerful dynamic
that has huge commercial and cultural implications
is at play.
Namely, that technology
is enabling
trust between strangers.
We now live in a global village
where we can mimic the ties
that used to happen face to face,
but on a scale and in ways
that have never been possible before.
So what's actually happening
is that social networks and real-time technologies
are taking us back.
We're bartering, trading,
swapping, sharing,
but they're being reinvented
into dynamic and appealing forms.
What I find fascinating
is that we've actually wired our world to share,
whether that's our neighborhood, our school,
our office, or our Facebook network,
and that's creating an economy
of "what's mine is yours."
From the mighty eBay,
the grandfather of exchange marketplaces,
to car-sharing companies such as GoGet,
where you pay a monthly fee to rent cars by the hour,
to social lending platforms such as Zopa,
that will take anyone in this audience
with 100 dollars to lend,
and match them with a borrower anywhere in the world,
we're sharing and collaborating again
in ways that I believe
are more hip than hippie.
I call this "groundswell collaborative consumption."
of collaborative consumption,
I'd like to try and answer the question
that every author rightfully gets asked,
which is, where did this idea come from?
Now I'd like to say I woke up one morning
and said, "I'm going to write about collaborative consumption,"
but actually it was a complicated web
of seemingly disconnected ideas.
Over the next minute,
you're going to see a bit like a conceptual fireworks display
of all the dots that went on in my head.
The first thing I began to notice:
how many big concepts were emerging --
from the wisdom of crowds to smart mobs --
around how ridiculously easy it is
to form groups for a purpose.
And linked to this crowd mania
were examples all around the world --
from the election of a president
to the infamous Wikipedia, and everything in between --
on what the power of numbers could achieve.
and then you start to see that word everywhere?
That's what happened to me
when I noticed that we are moving
from passive consumers
to creators,
to highly enabled collaborators.
What's happening
is the Internet is removing the middleman,
so that anyone from a T-shirt designer
to a knitter
can make a living selling peer-to-peer.
And the ubiquitous force
of this peer-to-peer revolution
means that sharing is happening at phenomenal rates.
I mean, it's amazing to think
that, in every single minute of this speech,
25 hours
of YouTube video will be loaded.
Now what I find fascinating about these examples
is how they're actually tapping into
our primate instincts.
I mean, we're monkeys,
and we're born and bred to share and cooperate.
And we were doing so for thousands of years,
whether it's when we hunted in packs,
or farmed in cooperatives,
before this big system called hyper-consumption came along
and we built these fences
and created out own little fiefdoms.
But things are changing,
and one of the reasons why
is the digital natives, or Gen-Y.
They're growing up sharing --
files, video games, knowledge.
It's second nature to them.
So we, the millennials -- I am just a millennial --
are like foot soldiers,
moving us from a culture of "me" to a culture of "we."
is because of mobile collaboration.
We now live in a connected age
where we can locate anyone, anytime, in real-time,
from a small device in our hands.
All of this was going through my head
towards the end of 2008,
when, of course, the great financial crash happened.
Thomas Friedman is one of my favorite New York Times columnists,
and he poignantly commented
that 2008 is when we hit a wall,
when Mother Nature and the market
both said, "No more."
Now we rationally know
that an economy built on hyper-consumption
is a Ponzi scheme. It's a house of cards.
Yet, it's hard for us to individually know what to do.
Well it was a lot of noise and complexity in my head,
until actually I realized it was happening
because of four key drivers.
One, a renewed belief in the importance of community,
and a very redefinition of what friend and neighbor really means.
A torrent of peer-to-peer social networks
and real-time technologies,
fundamentally changing the way we behave.
Three, pressing unresolved environmental concerns.
And four, a global recession
that has fundamentally shocked
consumer behaviors.
These four drivers
are fusing together
and creating the big shift --
away from the 20th century,
defined by hyper-consumption,
towards the 21st century,
defined by collaborative consumption.
I generally believe we're at an inflection point
where the sharing behaviors --
through sites such as Flickr and Twitter
that are becoming second nature online --
are being applied to offline areas of our everyday lives.
From morning commutes to the way fashion is designed
to the way we grow food,
we are consuming and collaborating once again.
have actually gathered thousands of examples
from all around the world of collaborative consumption.
And although they vary enormously
in scale, maturity and purpose,
when we dived into them,
we realized that they could actually be organized into three clear systems.
The first is redistribution markets.
Redistribution markets, just like Swaptree,
are when you take a used, or pre-owned, item
and move it from where it's not needed
to somewhere, or someone, where it is.
They're increasingly thought of as the fifth 'R' --
reduce, reuse, recycle, repair
and redistribute --
because they stretch the life cycle of a product
and thereby reduce waste.
This is the sharing of resources
of things like money, skills and time.
I bet, in a couple of years,
that phrases like "coworking"
and "couchsurfing" and "time banks"
are going to become a part of everyday vernacular.
One of my favorite examples of collaborative lifestyles
is called Landshare.
It's a scheme in the U.K.
that matches Mr. Jones,
with some spare space in his back garden,
with Mrs. Smith, a would-be grower.
Together they grow their own food.
It's one of those ideas that's so simple, yet brilliant,
you wonder why it's never been done before.
is product-service systems.
This is where you pay for the benefit of the product --
what it does for you --
without needing to own the product outright.
This idea is particularly powerful
for things that have
high-idling capacity.
And that can be anything from baby goods
to fashions to --
how many of you have a power drill,
own a power drill? Right.
That power drill will be used around 12 to 13 minutes
in its entire lifetime.
(Laughter)
It's kind of ridiculous, right?
Because what you need is the hole, not the drill.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So why don't you rent the drill,
or, even better, rent out your own drill to other people
and make some money from it?
These three systems are coming together,
allowing people to share resources
without sacrificing their lifestyles,
or their cherished personal freedoms.
I'm not asking people
to share nicely in the sandpit.
of how powerful collaborative consumption can be
to change behaviors.
The average car
costs 8,000 dollars a year to run.
Yet, that car sits idle
for 23 hours a day.
So when you consider these two facts,
it starts to make a little less sense
that we have to own one outright.
So this is where car-sharing companies
such as Zipcar and GoGet come in.
In 2009,
Zipcar took 250 participants
from across 13 cities --
and they're all self-confessed car addicts
and car-sharing rookies --
and got them to surrender their keys for a month.
Instead, these people had to walk,
bike, take the train,
or other forms of public transport.
They could only use their Zipcar membership
when absolutely necessary.
The results of this challenge after just one month
was staggering.
It's amazing that 413 lbs were lost
just from the extra exercise.
But my favorite statistic
is that 100
out of the 250 participants
did not want their keys back.
In other words, the car addicts
had lost their urge to own.
Just think of libraries and laundrettes.
But I think they're entering a new age,
because technology makes sharing
frictionless and fun.
There's a great quote that was written in the New York Times
that said, "Sharing is to ownership
what the iPod is to the 8-track,
what solar power is to the coal mine."
I believe also, our generation,
our relationship to satisfying what we want
is far less tangible
than any other previous generation.
I don't want the DVD; I want the movie it carries.
I don't want a clunky answering machine;
I want the message it saves.
I don't want a CD; I want the music it plays.
In other words, I don't want stuff;
I want the needs or experiences it fulfills.
This is fueling a massive shift
from where usage trumps possessions --
or as Kevin Kelly, the editor of Wired magazine, puts it,
"where access is better than ownership."
dematerialize into the cloud,
a blurry line is appearing
between what's mine, what's yours,
and what's ours.
I want to give you one example
that shows how fast this evolution is happening.
This represents an eight-year time span.
We've gone from traditional car-ownership
to car-sharing companies, such as Zipcar and GoGet,
to ride-sharing platforms that match rides
to the newest entry, which is peer-to-peer car rental,
where you can actually make money
out of renting that car that sits idle for 23 hours a day
to your neighbor.
Now all of these systems
require a degree of trust,
and the cornerstone to this working
is reputation.
our reputation didn't matter so much,
because our credit history was far more important
that any kind of peer-to-peer review.
But now with the Web, we leave a trail.
With every spammer we flag,
with every idea we post, comment we share,
we're actually signaling how well we collaborate,
and whether we can or can't be trusted.
Let's go back to my first example,
Swaptree.
I can see that Rondoron
has completed 553 trades
with a 100 percent success rate.
In other words, I can trust him or her.
Now mark my words,
it's only a matter of time
before we're going to be able to perform a Google-like search
and see a cumulative picture
of our reputation capital.
And this reputation capital
will determine our access to collaborative consumption.
It's a new social currency, so to speak,
that could become as powerful as our credit rating.
I believe we're actually in a period
where we're waking up
from this humongous hangover
of emptiness and waste,
and we're taking a leap
to create a more sustainable system
built to serve our innate needs
for community and individual identity.
I believe it will be referred to
as a revolution, so to speak --
when society, faced with great challenges,
made a seismic shift
from individual getting and spending
towards a rediscovery of collective good.
I'm on a mission to make sharing cool.
I'm on a mission to make sharing hip.
Because I really believe
it can disrupt outdated modes of business,
help us leapfrog
over wasteful forms of hyper-consumption
and teach us when enough really is enough.
Alisa Volkman: So this is where our story begins --
the dramatic moments of the birth
of our first son, Declan.
Obviously a really profound moment,
and it changed our lives in many ways.
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways,
and those unexpected ways we later reflected on,
that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us,
and a year later, we launched Babble,
a website for parents.
as starting a few years earlier. AV: That's true.
It was a website called Nerve.com,
the tagline of which was "literate smut."
It was in theory, and hopefully in practice,
a smart online magazine
about sex and culture.
But you can understand the jokes that we get. Sex begets babies.
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble,
which we did.
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third. We'll see.
was not just the life stage thing,
which is, of course, relevant,
but it was really more about
our desire to speak very honestly
about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about.
It seems to us that
when people start dissembling, people start lying about things,
that's when it gets really interesting.
That's a subject that we want to dive into.
And we've been surprised to find, as young parents,
that there are almost more taboos around parenting
than there are around sex.
the early years were really wonderful,
but they were also really difficult.
And we feel like some of that difficulty
was because of this false advertisement around parenting.
(Laughter)
We subscribed to a lot of magazines, did our homework,
but really everywhere you look around, we were surrounded by images like this.
And we went into parenting
expecting our lives to look like this.
The sun was always streaming in, and our children would never be crying.
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested,
and in fact, it was not like that at all.
that we were looking at, with these beautiful images,
and looked at the scene in our actual living room,
it looked a little bit more like this.
These are our three sons.
And of course, they're not always crying and screaming,
but with three boys, there's a decent probability
that at least one of them will not be comporting himself
exactly as he should.
We really felt like what we went in expecting
had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing,
and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight.
We really wanted to let them understand
what the realities of parenting were in an honest way.
is share with you four parenting taboos.
And of course, there are many more than four things
you can't say about parenting,
but we would like to share with you today
four that are particularly relevant for us personally.
So the first, taboo number one:
you can't say you didn't fall in love with your baby
in the very first minute.
I remember vividly, sitting there in the hospital.
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child.
Misuse of the pronoun.
Alisa was very generously in the process
of giving birth to our first child -- (AV: Thank you.)
-- and I was there with a catcher's mitt.
And I was there with my arms open.
The nurse was coming at me
with this beautiful, beautiful child,
and I remember, as she was approaching me,
the voices of friends saying,
"The moment they put the baby in your hands,
you will feel a sense of love that will come over you
that is [on] an order of magnitude more powerful
than anything you've ever experienced in your entire life."
So I was bracing myself for the moment.
The baby was coming,
and I was ready for this Mack truck of love
to just knock me off my feet.
And instead, when the baby was placed in my hands,
it was an extraordinary moment.
This picture is from literally a few seconds after
the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over.
And you can see, our eyes were glistening.
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife,
with deep, deep gratitude
that we had what appeared to be a healthy child.
And it was also, of course, surreal.
I mean, I had to check the tags and make sure.
I was incredulous, "Are you sure this is our child?"
And this was all quite remarkable.
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection,
but nothing like what I feel for him now, five years later.
that is heretical.
We have charted
our love for our child over time.
(Laughter)
This, as you know, is an act of heresy.
You're not allowed to chart love.
The reason you're not allowed to chart love
is because we think of love as a binary thing.
You're either in love, or you're not in love.
You love, or you don't love.
And I think the reality is that love is a process,
and I think the problem with thinking of love
as something that's binary
is that it causes us
to be unduly concerned
that love is fraudulent, or inadequate, or what have you.
And I think I'm speaking obviously here to the father's experience.
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense
in the early months, maybe their first year,
that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion.
because you can notice where he dips in the first years
where I think I was doing most of the work.
But we like to joke,
in the first few months of all of our children's lives,
this is Uncle Rufus.
(Laughter)
that I'm not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up
amongst other babies.
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus.
and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him.
You can't talk about how lonely having a baby can be.
I enjoyed being pregnant. I loved it.
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me.
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy, all around me,
tracking it down till the actual due-date.
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity.
That continued into the the hospital. It was really exhilarating.
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors.
It was a really wonderful experience,
but when I got home,
I suddenly felt very disconnected
and suddenly shut in and shut out,
and I was really surprised by those feelings.
I did expect it to be difficult,
have sleepless nights, constant feedings,
but I did not expect the feelings
of isolation and loneliness that I experienced,
and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me,
that I was going to be feeling this way.
And I called my sister
whom I'm very close to -- and had three children --
and I asked her, "Why didn't you tell me
I was going to be feeling this way,
that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated?"
And she said -- I'll never forget --
"It's just not something you want to say to a mother
that's having a baby for the first time."
it's precisely what you really should be saying
to mothers who have kids for the first time.
And that this, of course, one of the themes for us
is that we think
that candor and brutal honesty
is critical to us collectively
being great parents.
And it's hard not to think
that part of what leads to this sense of isolation
is our modern world.
So Alisa's experience is not isolated.
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed
report feelings of loneliness.
Of those, 67 percent are most lonely
when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two.
In the process of preparing this,
we looked at how some other cultures around the world
deal with this period of time,
because here in the Western world,
less than 50 percent of us live near our family members,
which I think is part of why this is such a tough period.
So to take one example among many:
in Southern India
there's a practice known as jholabhari,
in which the pregnant woman, when she's seven or eight months pregnant,
moves in with her mother
and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies,
give birth and returns home to her nuclear family
several months after the child is born.
And this is one of many ways
that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period.
you can't talk about your miscarriage -- but today I'll talk about mine.
So after we had Declan,
we kind of recalibrated our expectations.
We thought we actually could go through this again
and thought we knew what we would be up against.
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant,
and I soon learned that we were having a boy,
and then when I was five months,
we learned that we had lost our child.
This is actually the last little image we have of him.
And it was obviously a very difficult time --
really painful.
As I was working through that mourning process,
I was amazed that I didn't want to see anybody.
I really wanted to crawl into a hole,
and I didn't really know how I was going
to work my way back into my surrounding community.
And I realize, I think, the way I was feeling that way,
is on a really deep gut level,
I was feeling a lot of shame
and embarrassed, frankly,
that, in some respects, I had failed
at delivering what I'm genetically engineered to do.
And of course, it made me question,
if I wasn't able to have another child,
what would that mean for my marriage,
and just me as a woman.
So it was a very difficult time.
As I started working through it more,
I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people.
I was really amazed
by all the stories that started flooding in.
People I interacted with daily,
worked with, was friends with,
family members that I had known a long time,
had never shared with me their own stories.
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork,
and I felt like I happened upon
this secret society of women that I now was a part of,
which was reassuring and also really concerning.
And I think,
miscarriage is an invisible loss.
There's not really a lot of community support around it.
There's really no ceremony,
rituals, or rites.
And I think, with a death, you have a funeral, you celebrate the life,
and there's a lot of community support,
and it's something women don't have with miscarriage.
it's a very common and very traumatic experience.
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage,
and I find this astounding.
In a survey, 74 percent of women said
that miscarriage, they felt, was partly their fault, which is awful.
And astoundingly, 22 percent
said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse.
you can't say that your average happiness
has declined since having a child.
The party line is that every single aspect of my life
has just gotten dramatically better
ever since I participated
in the miracle that is childbirth and family.
I'll never forget, I remember vividly to this day,
our first son, Declan, was nine months old,
and I was sitting there on the couch,
and I was reading Daniel Gilbert's wonderful book, "Stumbling on Happiness."
And I got about two-thirds of the way through,
and there was a chart on the right-hand side --
on the right-hand page --
that we've labeled here
"The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable
for a New Parent."
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies.
Basically, there's this precipitous drop
of marital satisfaction,
which is closely aligned, we all know, with broader happiness,
that doesn't rise again
until your first child goes to college.
So I'm sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life,
this chasm of happiness
that we're driving our proverbial convertible straight into.
We were despondent.
but we'd come out of it,
and were really shocked to see this study.
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it
in hopes that we would find a silver lining.
because we got this incredible reporter
to go and interview all the scientists
who conducted these four studies.
We said, something is wrong here.
There's something missing from these studies.
It can't possibly be that bad.
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece,
and she interviewed four scientists,
and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert,
and we did indeed find a silver lining.
So this is our guess
as to what this baseline of average happiness
arguably looks like throughout life.
Average happiness is, of course, inadequate,
because it doesn't speak
to the moment-by-moment experience,
and so this is what we think it looks like
when you layer in
moment-to-moment experience.
And so we all remember as children,
the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children --
the teeniest little thing
can just rocket them to these heights
of just utter adulation,
and then the next teeniest little thing
can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair.
And it's just extraordinary to watch, and we remember it ourselves.
And then, of course, as you get older,
it's almost like age is a form of lithium.
And part of what happens, I think, in your '20s and '30s,
is you start to learn to hedge your happiness.
You start to realize that
"Hey, I could go to this live music event
and have an utterly transforming experience
that will cover my entire body with goosebumps,
but it's more likely that I'll feel claustrophobic
and I won't be able to get a beer.
So I'm not going to go.
I've got a good stereo at home. So, I'm not going to go."
So your average happiness goes up,
but you lose those transcendent moments.
and then you really resubmit yourself
to these highs and lows --
the highs being the first steps, the first smile,
your child reading to you for the first time --
the lows being, our house, any time from six to seven every night.
But you realize you resubmit yourself
to losing control in a really wonderful way,
which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives
and is quite gratifying.
we trade average happiness.
We trade the sort of security and safety
of a certain level of contentment
for these transcendent moments.
So where does that leave the two of us
as a family with our three little boys
in the thick of all this?
There's another factor in our case.
We have violated yet another taboo
in our own lives,
and this is a bonus taboo.
especially with three children --
and we are.
Everybody knows, you should absolutely not work with your spouse.
In fact, when we first went out to raise money to start Babble,
the venture capitalists said,
"We categorically don't invest
in companies founded by husbands and wives,
because there's an extra point of failure.
It's a bad idea. Don't do it."
And we obviously went forward. We did.
We raised the money, and we're thrilled that we did,
because in this phase of one's life,
the incredibly scarce resource is time.
And if you're really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are --
and you're also passionate about your relationship,
this is the only way we know how to do it.
And so the final question that we would ask is:
can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards?
It's great that we have these transcendent moments of joy,
but they're sometimes pretty quick.
And so how about that average baseline of happiness?
Can we move that up a little bit?
is really the result of walking into parenting --
and really any long-term partnership for that matter --
with the wrong expectations.
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management,
we feel like it's going to be a pretty gratifying experience.
And we think that a lot of parents,
when you get in there -- in our case anyway --
you pack your bags for a trip to Europe, and you're really excited to go.
Get out of the airplane,
it turns out you're trekking in Nepal.
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience,
particularly if you pack your bags properly
and you know what you're getting in for and you're psyched.
So the point of all this for us today
is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty,
but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences,
that we can all collectively
bend that happiness baseline up a little bit.
I have been teaching for a long time,
and in doing so
have acquired a body of knowledge about kids and learning
that I really wish more people would understand
about the potential of students.
In 1931, my grandmother --
bottom left for you guys over here --
graduated from the eighth grade.
She went to school to get the information
because that's where the information lived.
It was in the books; it was inside the teacher's head;
and she needed to go there to get the information,
because that's how you learned.
Fast-forward a generation:
this is the one-room schoolhouse, Oak Grove,
where my father went to a one-room schoolhouse.
And he again had to travel to the school
to get the information from the teacher,
stored it in the only portable memory he has, which is inside his own head,
and take it with him,
because that is how information was being transported
from teacher to student and then used in the world.
When I was a kid,
we had a set of encyclopedias at my house.
It was purchased the year I was born,
and it was extraordinary,
because I did not have to wait to go to the library to get to the information.
The information was inside my house
and it was awesome.
This was different
than either generation had experienced before,
and it changed the way I interacted with information
even at just a small level.
But the information was closer to me.
I could get access to it.
between when I was a kid in high school
and when I started teaching,
we really see the advent of the Internet.
Right about the time that the Internet gets going
as an educational tool,
I take off from Wisconsin
and move to Kansas, small town Kansas,
where I had an opportunity to teach
in a lovely, small-town,
rural Kansas school district,
where I was teaching my favorite subject,
American government.
My first year -- super gung-ho -- going to teach American government,
loved the political system.
Kids in the 12th grade:
not exactly all that enthusiastic
about the American government system.
Year two: learned a few things -- had to change my tactic.
And I put in front of them an authentic experience
that allowed them to learn for themselves.
I didn't tell them what to do or how to do it.
I posed a problem in front of them,
which was to put on an election forum for their own community.
They checked schedules. They were meeting with secretaries.
They produced an election forum booklet
for the entire town to learn more about their candidates.
They invited everyone into the school
for an evening of conversation
about government and politics
and whether or not the streets were done well,
and really had this robust experiential learning.
The older teachers -- more experienced --
looked at me and went,
"Oh, there she is. That's so cute. She's trying to get that done."
(Laughter)
"She doesn't know what she's in for."
But I knew that the kids would show up,
and I believed it,
and I told them every week what I expected out of them.
And that night, all 90 kids --
dressed appropriately, doing their job, owning it.
I had to just sit and watch.
It was theirs. It was experiential. It was authentic.
It meant something to them.
And they will step up.
where I taught in Flagstaff for a number of years,
this time with middle school students.
Luckily, I didn't have to teach them American government.
Could teach them the more exciting topic of geography.
Again, "thrilled" to learn.
But what was interesting
about this position I found myself in in Arizona,
was I had this really
extraordinarily eclectic group of kids to work with
in a truly public school,
and we got to have these moments where we would get these opportunities.
And one opportunity
was we got to go and meet Paul Rusesabagina,
which is the gentleman
that the movie "Hotel Rwanda" is based after.
And he was going to speak at the high school next door to us.
We could walk there. We didn't even have to pay for the buses.
There was no expense cost. Perfect field trip.
how do you take seventh- and eighth-graders to a talk about genocide
and deal with the subject in a way
that is responsible and respectful,
and they know what to do with it.
And so we chose to look at Paul Rusesabagina
as an example of a gentleman
who singularly used his life to do something positive.
I then challenged the kids to identify
someone in their own life, or in their own story, or in their own world,
that they could identify that had done a similar thing.
I asked them to produce a little movie about it.
It's the first time we'd done this.
Nobody really knew how to make these little movies on the computer,
but they were into it. And I asked them to put their own voice over it.
It was the most awesome moment of revelation
that when you ask kids to use their own voice
and ask them to speak for themselves,
what they're willing to share.
The last question of the assignment is:
how do you plan to use your life
to positively impact other people?
The things that kids will say
when you ask them and take the time to listen
is extraordinary.
I teach at the Science Leadership Academy,
which is a partnership school between the Franklin Institute
and the school district of Philadelphia.
We are a nine through 12 public school,
but we do school quite differently.
I moved there primarily
to be part of a learning environment
that validated the way that I knew that kids learned,
and that really wanted to investigate
what was possible
when you are willing to let go
of some of the paradigms of the past,
of information scarcity when my grandmother was in school
and when my father was in school and even when I was in school,
and to a moment when we have information surplus.
So what do you do when the information is all around you?
Why do you have kids come to school
if they no longer have to come there to get the information?
so the kids are bringing in laptops with them everyday,
taking them home, getting access to information.
And here's the thing that you need to get comfortable with
when you've given the tool
to acquire information to students,
is that you have to be comfortable with this idea
of allowing kids to fail
as part of the learning process.
We deal right now in the educational landscape
with an infatuation
with the culture of one right answer
that can be properly bubbled on the average multiple choice test,
and I am here to share with you:
it is not learning.
That is the absolute wrong thing to ask,
to tell kids to never be wrong.
To ask them to always have the right answer
doesn't allow them to learn.
So we did this project,
and this is one of the artifacts of the project.
I almost never show them off
because of the issue of the idea of failure.
as a result of a unit that we decided to do at the end of the year
responding to the oil spill.
I asked them to take the examples that we were seeing
of the info-graphics that existed
in a lot of mass media,
and take a look at what were the interesting components of it,
and produce one for themselves
of a different man-made disaster from American history.
And they had certain criteria to do it.
They were a little uncomfortable with it,
because we'd never done this before, and they didn't know exactly how to do it.
They can talk -- they're very smooth,
and they can write very, very well,
but asking them to communicate ideas in a different way
was a little uncomfortable for them.
But I gave them the room to just do the thing.
Go create. Go figure it out.
Let's see what we can do.
And the student that persistently
turns out the best visual product did not disappoint.
This was done in like two or three days.
And this is the work of the student that consistently did it.
And they immediately went, "There it is."
Didn't read anything. "There it is."
And I said, "Well what makes it great?"
And they're like, "Oh, the design's good, and he's using good color.
And there's some ... " And they went through all that we processed out loud.
And I said, "Go read it."
And they're like, "Oh, that one wasn't so awesome."
And then we went to another one --
it didn't have great visuals, but it had great information --
and spent an hour talking about the learning process,
because it wasn't about whether or not it was perfect,
or whether or not it was what I could create.
It asked them to create for themselves,
and it allowed them to fail,
process, learn from.
And when we do another round of this in my class this year,
they will do better this time,
because learning
has to include an amount of failure,
because failure is instructional
in the process.
that I could click through here,
and had to choose carefully -- this is one of my favorites --
of students learning,
of what learning can look like
in a landscape where we let go of the idea
that kids have to come to school to get the information,
but instead, ask them what they can do with it.
Ask them really interesting questions.
They will not disappoint.
Ask them to go to places,
to see things for themselves,
to actually experience the learning,
to play, to inquire.
This is one of my favorite photos,
because this was taken on Tuesday,
when I asked the students to go to the polls.
This is Robbie, and this was his first day of voting,
and he wanted to share that with everybody and do that.
But this is learning too,
because we asked them to go out into real spaces.
is that, if we continue to look at education
as if it's about coming to school
to get the information
and not about experiential learning,
empowering student voice and embracing failure,
we're missing the mark.
And everything that everybody is talking about today
isn't possible if we keep having an educational system
that does not value these qualities,
because we won't get there with a standardized test,
and we won't get there with a culture of one right answer.
We know how to do this better,
and it's time to do better.
We are now going through an amazing and unprecedented moment
where the power dynamics between men and women
are shifting very rapidly,
and in many of the places where it counts the most,
women are, in fact, taking control of everything.
In my mother's day, she didn't go to college.
Not a lot of women did.
And now, for every two men who get a college degree,
three women will do the same.
Women, for the first time this year,
became the majority of the American workforce.
And they're starting to dominate lots of professions --
doctors, lawyers,
bankers, accountants.
Over 50 percent of managers are women these days,
and in the 15 professions
projected to grow the most in the next decade,
all but two of them are dominated by women.
So the global economy is becoming a place
where women are more successful than men,
believe it or not,
and these economic changes
are starting to rapidly affect our culture --
what our romantic comedies look like,
what our marriages look like,
what our dating lives look like,
and our new set of superheroes.
tough, rugged,
in control of his own environment.
A few years ago, the Marlboro Man was retired
and replaced by this
much less impressive specimen,
who is a parody of American manhood,
and that's what we have in our commercials today.
The phrase "first-born son"
is so deeply ingrained in our consciousness
that this statistic alone shocked me.
In American fertility clinics,
75 percent of couples
are requesting girls and not boys.
And in places where you wouldn't think,
such as South Korea, India and China,
the very strict patriarchal societies
are starting to break down a little,
and families are no longer
strongly preferring first-born sons.
and start to connect the dots,
you can see the evidence everywhere.
You can see it in college graduation patterns,
in job projections,
in our marriage statistics,
you can see it in the Icelandic elections, which you'll hear about later,
and you can see it on South Korean surveys on son preference,
that something amazing and unprecedented
is happening with women.
Certainly this is not the first time that we've had great progress with women.
The '20s and the '60s also come to mind.
But the difference is that, back then,
it was driven by a very passionate feminist movement
that was trying to project its own desires,
whereas this time, it's not about passion,
and it's not about any kind of movement.
This is really just about the facts
of this economic moment that we live in.
The 200,000-year period
in which men have been top dog
is truly coming to an end, believe it or not,
and that's why I talk about the "end of men."
this is not the moment where you tune out or throw some tomatoes,
because the point is that this
is happening to all of us.
I myself have a husband and a father
and two sons whom I dearly love.
And this is why I like to talk about this,
because if we don't acknowledge it,
then the transition will be pretty painful.
But if we do take account of it,
then I think it will go much more smoothly.
I first started thinking about this about a year and a half ago.
I was reading headlines about the recession just like anyone else,
and I started to notice a distinct pattern --
that the recession was affecting men
much more deeply than it was affecting women.
And I remembered back to about 10 years ago
when I read a book by Susan Faludi
called "Stiffed: The Betrayal of the American Man,"
in which she described how hard the recession had hit men,
and I started to think about
whether it had gotten worse this time around in this recession.
And I realized that two things were different this time around.
The first was that
these were no longer just temporary hits
that the recession was giving men --
that this was reflecting a deeper
underlying shift in our global economy.
And second, that the story was no longer
just about the crisis of men,
but it was also about what was happening to women.
These are headlines about what's been going on with women in the next few years.
These are things we never could have imagined a few years ago.
Women, a majority of the workplace.
And labor statistics: women take up most managerial jobs.
This second set of headlines --
you can see that families and marriages are starting to shift.
And look at that last headline --
young women earning more than young men.
That particular headline comes to me from a market research firm.
They were basically asked by one of their clients
who was going to buy houses in that neighborhood in the future.
And they expected that it would be young families,
or young men, just like it had always been.
But in fact, they found something very surprising.
It was young, single women
who were the major purchasers of houses in the neighborhood.
And so they decided, because they were intrigued by this finding,
to do a nationwide survey.
So they spread out all the census data,
and what they found, the guy described to me as a shocker,
which is that in 1,997
out of 2,000 communities,
women, young women,
were making more money than young men.
So here you have a generation of young women
who grow up thinking of themselves
as being more powerful earners
than the young men around them.
but I still haven't explained to you why this is happening.
And in a moment, I'm going to show you a graph,
and what you'll see on this graph --
it begins in 1973,
just before women start flooding the workforce,
and it brings us up to our current day.
And basically what you'll see
is what economists talk about
as the polarization of the economy.
Now what does that mean?
It means that the economy is dividing into high-skill, high-wage jobs
and low-skill, low-wage jobs --
and that the middle, the middle-skill jobs,
and the middle-earning jobs, are starting to drop out of the economy.
This has been going on for 40 years now.
But this process is affecting men
very differently than it's affecting women.
You'll see the women in red, and you'll see the men in blue.
You'll watch them both drop out of the middle class,
but see what happens to women and see what happens to men.
There we go.
So watch that. You see them both drop out of the middle class.
Watch what happens to the women. Watch what happens to the men.
The men sort of stagnate there,
while the women zoom up in those high-skill jobs.
So what's that about?
It looks like women got some power boost on a video game,
or like they snuck in some secret serum into their birth-control pills
that lets them shoot up high.
But of course, it's not about that.
We used to have a manufacturing economy,
which was about building goods and products,
and now we have a service economy
and an information and creative economy.
Those two economies require very different skills,
and as it happens, women have been much better
at acquiring the new set of skills than men have been.
It used to be that you were
a guy who went to high school
who didn't have a college degree,
but you had a specific set of skills,
and with the help of a union,
you could make yourself a pretty good middle-class life.
But that really isn't true anymore.
This new economy is pretty indifferent
to size and strength,
which is what's helped men along all these years.
What the economy requires now
is a whole different set of skills.
You basically need intelligence,
you need an ability to sit still and focus,
to communicate openly,
to be able to listen to people
and to operate in a workplace that is much more fluid than it used to be,
and those are things that women do extremely well,
as we're seeing.
it used to be that our ideal leader
sounded something like General Patton, right?
You would be issuing orders from above.
You would be very hierarchical.
You would tell everyone below you what to do.
But that's not what an ideal leader is like now.
If you read management books now,
a leader is somebody who can foster creativity,
who can get his -- get the employees -- see, I still say "his" --
who can get the employees to talk to each other,
who can basically build teams and get them to be creative.
And those are all things that women do very well.
Women enter the workplace at the top,
and then at the working class,
all the new jobs that are created
are the kinds of jobs that wives used to do for free at home.
So that's childcare,
elder care and food preparation.
So those are all the jobs that are growing,
and those are jobs that women tend to do.
Now one day it might be
that mothers will hire an out-of-work,
middle-aged, former steelworker guy
to watch their children at home,
and that would be good for the men, but that hasn't quite happened yet.
you have to look at our future workforce.
And here the story is fairly simple.
Women are getting college degrees
at a faster rate than men.
Why? This is a real mystery.
People have asked men, why don't they just go back to college,
to community college, say, and retool themselves,
learn a new set of skills?
Well it turns out that they're just very uncomfortable doing that.
They're used to thinking of themselves as providers,
and they can't seem to build the social networks
that allow them to get through college.
So for some reason
men just don't end up going back to college.
And what's even more disturbing
is what's happening with younger boys.
There's been about a decade of research
about what people are calling the "boy crisis."
Now the boy crisis is this idea
that very young boys, for whatever reason,
are doing worse in school than very young girls,
and people have theories about that.
Is it because we have an excessively verbal curriculum,
and little girls are better at that than little boys?
Or that we require kids to sit still too much,
and so boys initially feel like failures?
And some people say it's because,
in 9th grade, boys start dropping out of school.
Because I'm writing a book about all this, I'm still looking into it,
so I don't have the answer.
But in the mean time, I'm going to call on the worldwide education expert,
who's my 10-year-old daughter, Noa,
to talk to you about
why the boys in her class do worse.
I mean they have much larger vocabulary.
They learn much faster.
They are more controlled.
On the board today for losing recess tomorrow, only boys.
while the girls sat there very nicely.
This whole thesis really came home to me
when I went to visit a college in Kansas City --
working-class college.
Certainly, when I was in college, I had certain expectations about my life --
that my husband and I would both work,
and that we would equally raise the children.
But these college girls
had a completely different view of their future.
Basically, the way they said it to me is
that they would be working 18 hours a day,
that their husband would maybe have a job,
but that mostly he would be at home taking care of the kiddies.
And this was kind of a shocker to me.
And then here's my favorite quote from one of the girls:
"Men are the new ball and chain."
but that quote has kind of a sting to it, right?
And I think the reason it has a sting
is because thousands of years of history
don't reverse themselves
without a lot of pain,
and that's why I talk about
us all going through this together.
The night after I talked to these college girls,
I also went to a men's group in Kansas,
and these were exactly the kind of victims of the manufacturing economy
which I spoke to you about earlier.
They were men who had been contractors,
or they had been building houses
and they had lost their jobs after the housing boom,
and they were in this group because they were failing to pay their child support.
And the instructor was up there in the class
explaining to them all the ways
in which they had lost their identity in this new age.
He was telling them they no longer had any moral authority,
that nobody needed them for emotional support anymore,
and they were not really the providers.
So who were they?
And this was very disheartening for them.
And what he did was he wrote down on the board
"$85,000,"
and he said, "That's her salary,"
and then he wrote down "$12,000."
"That's your salary.
So who's the man now?" he asked them.
"Who's the damn man?
She's the man now."
And that really sent a shudder through the room.
And that's part of the reason I like to talk about this,
because I think it can be pretty painful,
and we really have to work through it.
is because it's not just happening in the U.S.
It's happening all over the world.
In India, poor women are learning English
faster than their male counterparts
in order to staff the new call centers
that are growing in India.
In China, a lot of the opening up of private entrepreneurship
is happening because women are starting businesses,
small businesses, faster than men.
And here's my favorite example, which is in South Korea.
Over several decades,
South Korea built one of the most patriarchal societies we know about.
They basically enshrined the second-class status of women
in the civil code.
And if women failed to birth male children,
they were basically treated like domestic servants.
And sometimes family would pray to the spirits to kill off a girl child
so they could have a male child.
But over the '70s and '80s,
the South Korea government decided they wanted to rapidly industrialize,
and so what they did was,
they started to push women into the workforce.
Now they've been asking a question since 1985:
"How strongly do you prefer a first-born son?"
And now look at the chart.
That's from 1985 to 2003.
How much do you prefer a first-born son?
really do have a strong effect on our culture.
Now because we haven't fully processed this information,
it's kind of coming back to us in our pop culture
in these kind of weird and exaggerated ways,
where you can see that the stereotypes are changing.
And so we have on the male side
what one of my colleagues likes to call the "omega males" popping up,
who are the males who are romantically challenged losers
who can't find a job.
And they come up in lots of different forms.
So we have the perpetual adolescent.
We have the charmless misanthrope.
Then we have our Bud Light guy
who's the happy couch potato.
And then here's a shocker: even America's most sexiest man alive,
the sexiest man alive
gets romantically played these days in a movie.
And then on the female side, you have the opposite,
in which you have these crazy superhero women.
You've got Lady Gaga.
You've got our new James Bond, who's Angelina Jolie.
And it's not just for the young, right?
Even Helen Mirren can hold a gun these days.
And so it feels like we have to move from this place
where we've got these uber-exaggerated images
into something that feels a little more normal.
we've lived with the term "glass ceiling."
Now I've never really liked this term.
For one thing, it puts men and women
in a really antagonistic relationship with one another,
because the men are these devious tricksters up there
who've put up this glass ceiling.
And we're always below the glass ceiling, the women.
And we have a lot of skill and experience,
but it's a trick, so how are you supposed to prepare
to get through that glass ceiling?
And also, "shattering the glass ceiling" is a terrible phrase.
What crazy person
would pop their head through a glass ceiling?
instead of glass ceiling,
is the high bridge.
It's definitely terrifying to stand at the foot of a high bridge,
but it's also pretty exhilarating,
because it's beautiful up there,
and you're looking out on a beautiful view.
And the great thing is there's no trick like with the glass ceiling.
There's no man or woman standing in the middle
about to cut the cables.
There's no hole in the middle that you're going to fall through.
And the great thing is that you can take anyone along with you.
You can bring your husband along.
You can bring your friends, or your colleagues,
or your babysitter to walk along with you.
And husbands can drag their wives across, if their wives don't feel ready.
But the point about the high bridge
is that you have to have the confidence
to know that you deserve to be on that bridge,
that you have all the skills and experience you need
in order to walk across the high bridge,
but you just have to make the decision
to take the first step and do it.
Now I'm going to give you a story.
It's an Indian story about an Indian woman and her journey.
Let me begin with my parents.
I'm a product of this
visionary mother and father.
Many years ago, when I was born in the '50s --
'50s and '60s
didn't belong to girls in India.
They belonged to boys.
They belonged to boys who would join business
and inherit business from parents,
and girls would be dolled up to get married.
My family, in my city,
and almost in the country, was unique.
We were four of us, not one,
and fortunately no boys.
We were four girls and no boys.
And my parents were part
of a landed property family.
My father defied his own grandfather,
almost to the point of disinheritance,
because he decided to educate
all four of us.
He sent us to one of the best schools in the city
and gave us the best education.
As I've said, when we're born, we don't choose our parents,
and when we go to school, we don't choose our school.
Children don't choose a school.
They just get the school which parents choose for them.
So this is the foundation time which I got.
I grew up like this, and so did my other three sisters.
And my father used to say at that time,
"I'm going to spread all my four daughters in four corners of the world."
I don't know if he really meant [that], but it happened.
I'm the only one who's left in India.
One is a British, another is an American
and the third is a Canadian.
So we are four of us in four corners of the world.
I followed two things which my father and mother gave me.
One, they said, "Life is on an incline.
You either go up,
or you come down."
And the second thing, which has stayed with me,
which became my philosophy of life,
which made all the difference,
is: 100 things happen in your life, good or bad.
Out of 100, 90 are your creation.
They're good. They're your creation. Enjoy it.
If they're bad, they're your creation. Learn from it.
Ten are nature-sent over which you can't do a thing.
It's like a death of a relative,
or a cyclone, or a hurricane, or an earthquake.
You can't do a thing about it.
You've got to just respond to the situation.
But that response comes out of those 90 points.
Since I'm a product of this philosophy,
of 90/10,
and secondly, "life on an incline,"
that's the way I grew up
to be valuing what I got.
I'm a product of opportunities,
rare opportunities in the '50s and the '60s,
which girls didn't get,
and I was conscious of the fact that what my parents were giving me
was something unique.
Because all of my best school friends were getting dolled up
to get married with a lot of dowry,
and here I was with a tennis racket and going to school
and doing all kinds of extracurricular activities.
I thought I must tell you this.
Why I said this, is the background.
I joined the Indian Police Service as a tough woman,
a woman with indefatigable stamina,
because I used to run for my tennis titles, etc.
But I joined the Indian Police Service,
and then it was a new pattern of policing.
For me the policing stood for power to correct,
power to prevent and power to detect.
This is something like a new definition ever given in policing in India --
the power to prevent.
Because normally it was always said, power to detect, and that's it,
or power to punish.
But I decided no, it's a power to prevent,
because that's what I learned when I was growing up.
How do I prevent the 10 and never make it more than 10?
So this was how it came into my service,
and it was different from the men.
I didn't want to make it different from the men, but it was different,
because this was the way I was different.
And I redefined policing concepts in India.
I'm going to take you on two journeys,
my policing journey and my prison journey.
What you see, if you see the title
called "PM's car held."
This was the first time a prime minister of India
was given a parking ticket.
(Laughter)
That's the first time in India,
and I can tell you, that's the last time you're hearing about it.
It'll never happen again in India,
because now it was once and forever.
And the rule was, because I was sensitive,
I was compassionate, I was very sensitive to injustice,
and I was very pro-justice.
That's the reason, as a woman, I joined the Indian Police Service.
I had other options, but I didn't choose them.
This is about tough policing, equal policing.
Now I was known as "here's a woman that's not going to listen."
So I was sent to all indiscriminate postings,
postings which others would say no.
I now went to a prison assignment as a police officer.
Normally police officers don't want to do prison.
They sent me to prison to lock me up,
thinking, "Now there will be no cars
and no VIPs to be given tickets to.
Let's lock her up."
Here I got a prison assignment.
This was a prison assignment which was one big den of criminals.
Obviously, it was.
But 10,000 men,
of which only 400 were women -- 10,000 --
9,000 plus about 600
were men.
Terrorists, rapists,
burglars, gangsters --
some of them I'd sent to jail
as a police officer outside.
And then how did I deal with them?
The first day when I went in,
I didn't know how to look at them.
And I said, "Do you pray?" When I looked at the group, I said, "Do you pray?"
They saw me as a young, short woman wearing a pathan suit.
I said, "Do you pray?"
And they didn't say anything.
I said, "Do you pray? Do you want to pray?"
They said, "Yes." I said, "All right, let's pray."
I prayed for them, and things started to change.
This is a visual of education inside the prison.
where everybody in the prison studies.
I started this with community support.
Government had no budget.
It was one of the finest, largest volunteerism
in any prison in the world.
This was initiated in Delhi prison.
You see one sample
of a prisoner teaching a class.
These are hundreds of classes.
Nine to eleven, every prisoner went into the education program --
the same den in which they thought
they would put me behind the bar and things would be forgotten.
We converted this into an ashram --
from a prison to an ashram through education.
I think that's the bigger change.
It was the beginning of a change.
Teachers were prisoners. Teachers were volunteers.
Books came from donated schoolbooks.
Stationery was donated.
Everything was donated,
because there was no budget of education for the prison.
Now if I'd not done that,
it would have been a hellhole.
I want to show you some moments of history in my journey,
which probably you would never ever get to see anywhere in the world.
One, the numbers you'll never get to see.
Secondly, this concept.
This was a meditation program inside the prison
of over 1,000 prisoners.
One thousand prisoners who sat in meditation.
This was one of the most courageous steps
I took as a prison governor.
And this is what transformed.
You want to know more about this,
go and see this film, "Doing Time, Doing Vipassana."
You will hear about it, and you will love it.
And write to me on KiranBedi.com,
and I'll respond to you.
Let me show you the next slide.
I took the same concept of mindfulness,
because, why did I bring meditation into the Indian prison?
Because crime is a product of a distorted mind.
It was distortion of mind which needed to be addressed to control.
Not by preaching, not by telling,
not by reading, but by addressing your mind.
I took the same thing to the police,
because police, equally, were prisoners of their minds,
and they felt as if it was "we" and "they,"
and that the people don't cooperate.
This worked.
This is a concept which I introduced
to listen to complaints, listen to grievances.
This was a magic box.
This was a sensitive box.
This is how a prisoner drew how they felt about the prison.
If you see somebody in the blue --
yeah, this guy --
he was a prisoner, and he was a teacher.
And you see, everybody's busy. There was no time to waste.
I'm currently into movements,
movements of education
of the under-served children,
which is thousands -- India is all about thousands.
Secondly is about the anti-corruption movement in India.
That's a big way
we, as a small group of activists,
have drafted an ombudsman bill for the government of India.
Friends, you will hear a lot about it.
That's the movement at the moment I'm driving,
and that's the movement and ambition of my life.
(Applause)
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
I grew up in New York City,
between Harlem and the Bronx.
Growing up as a boy, we were taught
that men had to be tough, had to be strong,
had to be courageous, dominating --
no pain, no emotions,
with the exception of anger --
and definitely no fear;
that men are in charge,
which means women are not;
that men lead,
and you should just follow and do what we say;
that men are superior; women are inferior;
that men are strong; women are weak;
that women are of less value,
property of men,
and objects,
particularly sexual objects.
I've later come to know that to be
the collective socialization of men,
better known
as the "man box."
See this man box has in it
all the ingredients
of how we define what it means to be a man.
Now I also want to say, without a doubt,
there are some wonderful, wonderful,
absolutely wonderful things
about being a man.
But at the same time,
there's some stuff
that's just straight up twisted,
and we really need to begin
to challenge, look at it
and really get in the process
of deconstructing, redefining,
what we come to know as manhood.
They're 11 and 12.
Kendall's 15 months older than Jay.
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I,
we just got real busy and whip, bam, boom:
Kendall and Jay.
(Laughter)
And when they were about five and six,
four and five,
Jay could come to me,
come to me crying.
It didn't matter what she was crying about,
she could get on my knee, she could snot my sleeve up,
just cry, cry it out.
Daddy's got you. That's all that's important.
and like I said, he's only 15 months older than her --
he'd come to me crying,
it's like as soon as I would hear him cry,
a clock would go off.
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds,
which means, by the time he got to me,
I was already saying things like, "Why are you crying?
Hold your head up. Look at me.
Explain to me what's wrong.
Tell me what's wrong. I can't understand you.
Why are you crying?"
And out of my own frustration
of my role and responsibility
of building him up as a man
to fit into these guidelines
and these structures that are defining this man box,
I would find myself saying things like,
"Just go in your room.
Just go on, go on in your room.
Sit down,
get yourself together
and come back and talk to me
when you can talk to me like a --" what?
(Audience: Man.)
Like a man.
And he's five years old.
And as I grow in life,
I would say to myself,
"My God, what's wrong with me?
What am I doing? Why would I do this?"
And I think back.
I think back to my father.
where we had a very troubled experience in our family.
My brother, Henry, he died tragically
when we were teenagers.
We lived in New York City, as I said.
We lived in the Bronx at the time,
and the burial was in a place called Long Island,
it was about two hours outside of the city.
And as we were preparing
to come back from the burial,
the cars stopped at the bathroom
to let folks take care of themselves
before the long ride back to the city.
And the limousine empties out.
My mother, my sister, my auntie, they all get out,
but my father and I stayed in the limousine,
and no sooner than the women got out,
he burst out crying.
He didn't want cry in front of me,
but he knew he wasn't going to make it back to the city,
and it was better me than to allow himself
to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women.
And this is a man
who, 10 minutes ago,
had just put his teenage son
in the ground --
something I just can't even imagine.
The thing that sticks with me the most
is that he was apologizing to me
for crying in front of me,
and at the same time, he was also giving me props,
lifting me up,
for not crying.
as this fear that we have as men,
this fear that just has us paralyzed,
holding us hostage
to this man box.
I can remember speaking
to a 12-year-old boy, a football player,
and I asked him, I said,
"How would you feel if,
in front of all the players,
your coach told you you were playing like a girl?"
Now I expected him to say something like,
I'd be sad; I'd be mad; I'd be angry, or something like that.
No, the boy said to me --
the boy said to me,
"It would destroy me."
And I said to myself,
"God, if it would destroy him
to be called a girl,
what are we then teaching him
about girls?"
when I was about 12 years old.
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city.
At this time we're living in the Bronx,
and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny.
He was about 16 years old,
and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys.
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys.
And this guy, he was up to a lot of no good.
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder,
"What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys?"
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good.
He was a troubled kid.
His mother had died from a heroin overdose.
He was being raised by his grandmother.
His father wasn't on the set.
His grandmother had two jobs.
He was home alone a lot.
But I've got to tell you, we young guys,
we looked up to this dude, man.
He was cool. He was fine.
That's what the sisters said, "He was fine."
He was having sex.
We all looked up to him.
just playing around, doing something -- I don't know what.
He looks out his window; he calls me upstairs; he said, "Hey Anthony."
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid.
"Hey Anthony, come on upstairs."
Johnny call, you go.
So I run right upstairs.
As he opens the door, he says to me, "Do you want some?"
Now I immediately knew what he meant.
Because for me growing up at that time,
and our relationship with this man box,
"Do you want some?" meant one of two things:
sex or drugs --
and we weren't doing drugs.
Now my box, my card,
my man box card,
was immediately in jeopardy.
Two things: One, I never had sex.
We don't talk about that as men.
You only tell your dearest, closest friend, sworn to secrecy for life,
the first time you had sex.
For everybody else, we go around like we've been having sex since we were two.
There ain't no first time.
(Laughter)
The other thing I couldn't tell him is that I didn't want any.
That's even worse. We're supposed to always be on the prowl.
Women are objects,
especially sexual objects.
So, like my mother would say, make a long story short,
I just simply said to Johnny, "Yes."
He told me to go in his room.
I go in his room. On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila.
She's 16 years old.
She's nude.
She's what I know today to be mentally ill,
higher-functioning at times than others.
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her.
Anyway, Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her.
Well actually, he raped her, but he would say he had sex with her.
Because, while Sheila never said no,
she also never said yes.
So when I go in the room, I close the door.
Folks, I'm petrified.
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can't bust in the room
and see that I'm not doing anything,
and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something.
So now I'm no longer trying to figure out what I'm going to do;
I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get out of this room.
So in my 12 years of wisdom,
I zip my pants down,
I walk out into the room,
and lo and behold to me,
while I was in the room with Sheila,
Johnny was back at the window calling guys up.
So now there's a living room full of guys.
It was like the waiting room in the doctor's office.
And they asked me how was it,
and I say to them, "It was good,"
and I zip my pants up in front of them,
and I head for the door.
and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time,
but I was conflicted, because, while I was feeling remorse, I was excited,
because I didn't get caught.
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening.
This fear, getting outside the man box,
totally enveloped me.
It was way more important to me,
about me and my man box card
than about Sheila
and what was happening to her.
are taught to have less value in women,
to view them as property and the objects of men.
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women.
We as men, good men,
the large majority of men,
we operate on the foundation
of this whole collective socialization.
We kind of see ourselves separate, but we're very much a part of it.
You see, we have to come to understand
that less value, property and objectification is the foundation
and the violence can't happen without it.
So we're very much a part of the solution
as well as the problem.
The center for disease control says
that men's violence against women is at epidemic proportions,
is the number one health concern for women
in this country and abroad.
this is the love of my life, my daughter Jay.
The world I envision for her --
how do I want men to be acting and behaving?
I need you on board. I need you with me.
I need you working with me and me working with you
on how we raise our sons
and teach them to be men --
that it's okay to not be dominating,
that it's okay to have feelings and emotions,
that it's okay to promote equality,
that it's okay to have women who are just friends and that's it,
that it's okay to be whole,
that my liberation as a man
is tied to your liberation as a woman. (Applause)
I asked a nine-year-old boy,
"What would life be like for you,
if you didn't have to adhere to this man box?"
He said to me, "I would be free."
It sure used to be a lot easier to be from Iceland,
because until a couple of years ago,
people knew hardly anything about us,
and I could basically come out here
and say only good things about us.
But in the last couple of years
we've become infamous for a couple of things.
First, of course, the economic meltdown.
It actually got so bad
that somebody put our country up for sale on eBay.
(Laughter)
Ninety-nine pence was the starting price
and no reserve.
Then there was the volcano
that interrupted the travel plans
of almost all of you and many of your friends,
including President Obama.
By the way, the pronunciation
is "Eyjafjallajokull."
None of your media got it right.
about these two things exactly.
I'm here to tell you the story of Audur Capital,
which is a financial firm founded by me
and Kristin -- who you see in the picture --
in the spring of 2007,
just over a year before the economic collapse hit.
Why would two women
who were enjoying successful careers in investment banking
in the corporate sector
leave to found a financial services firm?
Well let it suffice to say
that we felt a bit overwhelmed
with testosterone.
And I'm not here to say
that men are to blame for the crisis
and what happened in my country.
But I can surely tell you that in my country,
much like on Wall Street and the city of London and elsewhere,
men were at the helm
of the game of the financial sector,
and that kind of lack of diversity
and sameness
leads to disastrous problems.
and also with the strong feeling in our stomach
that this wasn't sustainable,
to found a financial services firm
based on our values,
and we decided to incorporate feminine values
into the world of finance.
Raised quite a few eyebrows in Iceland.
We weren't known
as the typical "women" women
in Iceland up until then.
So it was almost like coming out of the closet
to actually talk about the fact that we were women
and that we believed that we had a set of values
and a way of doing business
that would be more sustainable
than what we had experienced until then.
And we got a great group of people to join us --
principled people with great skills,
and investors with a vision
and values to match ours.
And together we got through the eye of the financial storm in Iceland
without taking any direct losses to our equity
or to the funds of our clients.
And although I want to thank
the talented people of our company
foremost for that --
and also there's a factor of luck and timing --
we are absolutely convinced
that we did this because of our values.
We believe in risk awareness.
What does that mean?
We believe that you should always understand the risks that you're taking,
and we will not invest
in things we don't understand.
Not a complicated thing.
But in 2007,
at the height of the sub-prime
and all the complicated financial structures,
it was quite opposite
to the reckless risk-taking behaviors
that we saw on the market.
We also believe in straight-talking,
telling it as it is,
using simple language that people understand,
telling people about the downsides
as well as the potential upsides,
and even telling the bad news that no one wants to utter,
like our lack of belief in the sustainability
of the Icelandic financial sector
that already we had
months before the collapse hit us.
And, although we do work in the financial sector,
where Excel is king,
we believe in emotional capital.
And we believe
that doing emotional due diligence
is just as important
as doing financial due diligence.
It is actually people
that make money and lose money,
not Excel spreadsheets.
we believe in profit with principles.
We care how we make our profit.
So while we want to make economic profit for ourselves and our customers,
we are willing to do it with a long-term view,
and we like to have a wider definition of profits
than just the economic profit in the next quarter.
So we like to see profits,
plus positive social
and environmental benefits, when we invest.
although we are convinced that they matter.
It was also about a business opportunity.
It's the female trend, and it's the sustainability trend,
that are going to create
some of the most interesting investment opportunities
in the years to come.
The whole thing about the female trend
is not about women being better than men;
it is actually about
women being different from men,
bringing different values and different ways to the table.
So what do you get? You get better decision-making,
and you get less herd behavior,
and both of those things hit your bottom line
with very positive results.
now that we've had this financial sector collapse upon us in Iceland --
and by the way, Europe looks pretty bad right now,
and many would say that you in America
are heading for some more trouble as well.
Now that we've had all that happen,
and we have all this data out there
telling us that it's much better to have diversity
around the decision-making tables,
will we see business and finance change?
Will government change?
I have days that I believe,
but I have days that I'm full of doubt.
Have you seen the incredible urge out there
to rebuild the very things that failed us?
(Applause)
Einstein said
that this was the definition of insanity --
to do the same things
over and over again,
hoping for a different outcome.
So I guess the world is insane,
because I see entirely too much
of doing the same things over and over again,
hoping that this time it's not going to collapse upon us.
I want to see more revolutionary thinking,
and I remain hopeful.
Like TED, I believe in people.
And I know that consumers
are becoming more conscious,
and they are going to start voting with their wallets,
and they are going to change the face
of business and finance from the outside,
if they don't do it from the inside.
and I should be; I'm from Iceland.
We have a long history
of strong, courageous, independent women,
ever since the Viking age.
And I want to tell you when
I first realized that women matter to the economy
and to the society,
I was seven -- it happened to be my mother's birthday --
October 24, 1975.
Women in Iceland took the day off.
From work or from home, they took the day off,
and nothing worked in Iceland.
(Laughter)
They marched into the center of Reykjavik,
and they put women's issues onto the agenda.
And some say this was the start of a global movement.
For me it was the start of a long journey,
but I decided that day to matter.
Five years later,
Iceland elected Vigdis Finnbogadottir as their president --
first female to become head of state,
single mom,
a breast cancer survivor
who had had one of her breasts removed.
And at one of the campaign sessions,
she had one of her male contenders
allude to the fact that she couldn't become president --
she was a woman, and even half a woman.
That night she won the election,
because she came back --
not just because of his crappy behavior --
but she came back and said,
"Well, I'm actually not going to breastfeed the Icelandic nation;
I'm going to lead it."
women role models
that have influenced who I am and where I am today.
But in spite of that,
I went through the first 10 or 15 years of my career
mostly in denial of being a woman.
Started in corporate America,
and I was absolutely convinced
that it was just about the individual,
that women and men would have just the same opportunities.
But I've come to conclude lately
that it isn't like that.
We are not the same,
and it's great. Because of our differences,
we create and sustain life.
So we should embrace our difference and aim for challenge.
is that I'm fed up with this tyranny
of either/or choices in life --
either it's men or it's women.
We need to start embracing the beauty of balance.
So let's move away
from thinking about business here and philanthropy there,
and let's start thinking about
doing good business.
That's how we change the world. That's the only sustainable future.
Restaurants and the food industry in general
are pretty much the most wasteful industry
in the world.
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,
10 calories are taken to produce it.
That's a lot.
I want to take something rather humble
to discuss.
I found this in the farmers' market today,
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.
The humble potato --
and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.
And it pretty much goes through
eight different forms in its lifetime.
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.
It grows and is nurtured.
It's then harvested.
It's then distributed,
and distribution is a massive issue.
It's then sold and bought,
and it's then delivered to me.
I basically take it, prepare it,
and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.
The last stage is basically waste,
and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.
There are different types of waste.
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;
and there's a waste of waste.
And every business I've been working on
over the past five years,
I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.
Basically a restaurant just like any other.
This is the restaurant, Acorn House.
Front and back.
So let me run you through a few ideas.
Floor: sustainable, recyclable.
Chairs: recycled and recyclable.
Tables: Forestry Commission.
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --
she didn't like sitting on it,
so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --
reusing, a job that was pretty good.
I hate waste, especially walls.
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,
and that shows all the customers my products.
The whole business is run on sustainable energy.
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.
Paint is all low-volume chemical,
which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --
but there's a work surface there.
And that's a plastic polymer.
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,
experiment with polymers.
Will they outlive me? They probably might.
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.
Now reusing is vital.
And we filter our own water.
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,
and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.
Here's a great little example.
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,
which has been turned inside out and sewn up.
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.
I basically created a menu that allowed people
to choose the amount and volume of food
that they wanted to consume.
Rather than me putting a dish down,
they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.
It serves 220 people a day.
We generate quite a lot of waste.
This is the waste room.
You can't get rid of waste.
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.
In here, I have produce and boxes
that are unavoidable.
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --
turns food into an inner material,
which I can store and then compost later.
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,
which is generated by the restaurant,
and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees
and wine casks and all kinds of things.
Three compost bins --
go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --
really good, makes fantastic compost.
A couple of wormeries in there too.
And actually one of the wormeries
was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.
And I tried taking the dried food waste,
putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."
It was like vegetable jerky,
and killed all of them.
I don't know how many worms [were] in there,
but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.
(Laughter)
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.
This takes the water out of the restaurant,
runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --
and I sort of water the garden with it.
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,
maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.
I started meditating on that
and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant
that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.
I managed to do it.
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --
same chairs, same tables.
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.
But this is an electrical restaurant.
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.
And it's run on hydroelectricity,
so I've gone from air to water.
Now it's important to understand
that this room
is cooled by water, heated by water,
filters its own water,
and it's powered by water.
It literally is Waterhouse.
The air handling system inside it --
I got rid of air-conditioning
because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.
This is basically air-handling.
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,
pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,
it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,
and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,
cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.
And this is an English willow air diffuser,
and that's softly moving
that air current through the room.
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,
there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.
This takes the temperature of the canal
and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.
(Laughter)
And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant
lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;
and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making
five restaurants based
on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.
I've got metal and earth to come.
So you've got to watch your space for that.
Okay. So this is my next project.
Five weeks old,
it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.
The People's Supermarket.
So basically, the restaurants only really hit
people who believed in what I was doing anyway.
What I needed to do was get food out
to a broader spectrum of people.
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --
or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.
This is a social enterprise,
not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.
It really is about the social disconnect
between food, communities
in urban settings
and their relationship to rural growers --
connecting communities in London to rural growers.
Really important.
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;
I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;
I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;
I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this
the most sustainable supermarket in the world.
That's zero food waste.
And no one's doing that just yet.
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,
let's have a go. Try it on.
I'm going to get there before you.
doesn't create waste as such.
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle
with waste being the end of the beginning,
and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,
and it's an important statement to understand.
If we don't stand up
and make a difference
and think about sustainable food,
think about the sustainable nature of it,
then we may fail.
But, I wanted to get up and show you
that we can do it if we're more responsible.
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.
They're here. You can see I've done three so far;
I've got a few more to go.
The idea is embryonic.
I think it's important.
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse
and recycle -- right at the end there --
recycling is the last point I want to make;
but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --
then I think we're going to be on our way.
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.
I think that there are many problems to come,
but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.
And I hope you all take part.
Okay, I'm going to show you
again something about our diets.
And I would like to know what the audience is,
and so who of you ever ate insects?
That's quite a lot.
(Laughter)
But still, you're not representing
the overall population of the Earth.
(Laughter)
Because there's 80 percent out there that really eats insects.
But this is quite good.
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs.
And here you see just a selection.
There's six million species of insects on this planet,
six million species.
There's a few hundreds of mammals --
six million species of insects.
In fact, if we count all the individual organisms,
we would come at much larger numbers.
In fact, of all animals on Earth,
of all animal species,
80 percent walks on six legs.
But if we would count all the individuals,
and we take an average weight of them,
it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms
for each of you and me on Earth.
That means that in terms of biomass,
insects are more abundant than we are,
and we're not on a planet of men,
but we're on a planet of insects.
Insects are not only there in nature,
but they also are involved in our economy,
usually without us knowing.
a conservative estimation, a couple of years ago
that the U.S. economy
benefited by 57 billion
dollars per year.
It's a number -- very large --
a contribution to the economy of the United States for free.
And so I looked up what the economy was paying
for the war in Iraq
in the same year.
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars.
Well we know that that
was not a cheap war.
So insects, just for free,
contribute to the economy of the United States
with about the same order of magnitude,
just for free, without everyone knowing.
And not only in the States,
but in any country, in any economy.
They remove dung, they pollinate our crops.
A third of all the fruits that we eat
are all a result
of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants.
They control pests,
and they're food for animals.
They're at the start of food chains.
Small animals eat insects.
Even larger animals eat insects.
But the small animals that eat insects
are being eaten by larger animals,
still larger animals.
And at the end of the food chain, we are eating them as well.
There's quite a lot of people that are eating insects.
And here you see me
in a small, provincial town in China, Lijiang --
about two million inhabitants.
If you go out for dinner, like in a fish restaurant,
where you can select which fish you want to eat,
you can select which insects you would like to eat.
And they prepare it in a wonderful way.
And here you see me enjoying a meal
with caterpillars, locusts,
bee pupae -- delicacies.
And you can eat something new everyday.
There's more than 1,000 species of insects
that are being eaten all around the globe.
That's quite a bit more
than just a few mammals that we're eating,
like a cow or a pig
or a sheep.
More than 1,000 species --
an enormous variety.
And now you may think, okay,
in this provincial town in China they're doing that, but not us.
already ate insects maybe occasionally,
but I can tell you that every one of you
is eating insects, without any exception.
You're eating at least
500 grams per year.
What are you eating?
Tomato soup, peanut butter,
chocolate, noodles --
any processed food that you're eating
contains insects,
because insects are here all around us,
and when they're out there in nature
they're also in our crops.
Some fruits get some insect damage.
Those are the fruits, if they're tomato,
that go to the tomato soup.
If they don't have any damage, they go to the grocery.
And that's your view of a tomato.
But there's tomatoes that end up in a soup,
and as long as they meet
the requirements of the food agency,
there can be all kinds of things in there,
no problem.
In fact, why would we put these balls in the soup,
there's meat in there anyway?
(Laughter)
In fact, all our processed foods
contain more proteins
than we would be aware of.
So anything is a good protein source already.
"Okay, so we're eating 500 grams just by accident."
We're even doing this on purpose.
In a lot of food items that we have --
I have only two items
here on the slide --
pink cookies or surimi sticks
or, if you like, Campari --
a lot of our food products that are of a red color
are dyed with a natural dye.
The surimi sticks
[of] crabmeat, or is being sold as crab meat,
is white fish
that's being dyed with cochineal.
Cochineal is a product
of an insect that lives off these cacti.
It's being produced in large amounts,
150 to 180 metric tons per year
in the Canary Islands in Peru,
and it's big business.
One gram of cochineal
costs about 30 euros.
One gram of gold
is 30 euros.
So it's a very precious thing
that we're using to dye our foods.
for you and me, for everyone on this Earth.
The human population is growing very rapidly
and is growing exponentially.
Where, at the moment, we have
something between six and seven billion people,
it will grow to about nine billion
in 2050.
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed,
and this is something that worries more and more people.
There was an FAO conference last October
that was completely devoted to this.
How are we going to feed this world?
And if you look at the figures up there,
it says that we have a third more mouths to feed,
but we need an agricultural production increase
of 70 percent.
And that's especially because this world population
is increasing,
and it's increasing, not only in numbers,
but we're also getting wealthier,
and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more
and also starts to eat more meat.
And meat, in fact, is something
that costs a lot
of our agricultural production.
and at the moment, most of us here
get it from livestock,
from fish, from game.
And we eat quite a lot of it.
In the developed world it's on average
80 kilograms per person per year,
which goes up to 120
in the United States
and a bit lower in some other countries,
but on average 80 kilograms
per person per year.
In the developing world it's much lower.
It's 25 kilograms per person per year.
But it's increasing enormously.
In China in the last 20 years,
it increased from 20 to 50,
and it's still increasing.
So if a third of the world population
is going to increase its meat consumption
from 25 to 80 on average,
and a third of the world population
is living in China and in India,
we're having an enormous demand on meat.
And of course, we are not there to say
that's only for us, it's not for them.
They have the same share that we have.
that we are eating way too much meat
in the Western world.
We could do with much, much less --
and I know, I've been a vegetarian for a long time,
and you can easily do without anything.
You'll get proteins in any kind of food anyway.
But then there's a lot of problems
that come with meat production,
and we're being faced with that more and more often.
The first problem that we're facing is human health.
Pigs are quite like us.
They're even models in medicine,
and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human.
That means that pigs also share diseases with us.
And a pig disease,
a pig virus, and a human virus
can both proliferate,
and because of their kind of reproduction,
they can combine and produce a new virus.
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s
during the classical swine fever outbreak.
You get a new disease that can be deadly.
We eat insects -- they're so distantly related from us
that this doesn't happen.
So that's one point for insects.
You take 10 kilograms of feed,
you can get one kilogram of beef,
but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat.
So if you would be an entrepreneur,
what would you do?
With 10 kilograms of input,
you can get either one or nine kg. of output.
So far we're taking
the one, or up to five kilograms of output.
We're not taking the bonus yet.
We're not taking the nine kilograms of output yet.
So that's two points for insects.
If we take 10 kilograms of food --
(Laughter)
and it results in one kilogram of beef,
the other nine kilograms are waste,
and a lot of that is manure.
If you produce insects, you have less manure
per kilogram of meat that you produce.
So less waste.
Furthermore, per kilogram of manure,
you have much, much less ammonia
and fewer greenhouse gases
when you have insect manure
than when you have cow manure.
So you have less waste,
and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign
as it is with cow dung.
So that's three points for insects.
and it is if insects produce meat
that is of good quality.
Well there have been all kinds of analyses
and in terms of protein, or fat, or vitamins,
it's very good.
In fact, it's comparable
to anything we eat as meat at the moment.
And even in terms of calories, it is very good.
One kilogram of grasshoppers
has the same amount of calories
as 10 hot dogs, or six Big Macs.
So that's four points for insects.
and I could make many more points for insects,
but time doesn't allow this.
So the question is, why not eat insects?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor.
We'll have to.
Even if you don't like it,
you'll have to get used to this
because at the moment,
70 percent of all our agricultural land
is being used to produce livestock.
That's not only the land
where the livestock is walking and feeding,
but it's also other areas
where the feed is being produced and being transported.
We can increase it a bit
at the expense of rainforests,
but there's a limitation very soon.
And if you remember that we need to increase
agricultural production by 70 percent,
we're not going to make it that way.
We could much better change
from meat, from beef,
to insects.
And then 80 percent of the world
already eats insects,
so we are just a minority --
in a country like the U.K., the USA,
the Netherlands, anywhere.
On the left-hand side, you see a market in Laos
where they have abundantly present
all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night.
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper.
So people there are eating them,
not because they're hungry,
but because they think it's a delicacy.
It's just very good food.
You can vary enormously.
It has many benefits.
that's very much like this grasshopper:
shrimps, a delicacy
being sold at a high price.
Who wouldn't like to eat a shrimp?
There are a few people who don't like shrimp,
but shrimp, or crabs,
or crayfish,
are very closely related.
They are delicacies.
In fact, a locust is a "shrimp" of the land,
and it would make very good into our diet.
So why are we not eating insects yet?
Well that's just a matter of mindset.
We're not used to it,
and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us.
That's why we're changing the perception of insects.
And I'm working very hard with my colleague, Arnold van Huis,
in telling people what insects are,
what magnificent things they are,
what magnificent jobs they do in nature.
And in fact, without insects,
we would not be here in this room,
because if the insects die out,
we will soon die out as well.
If we die out, the insects will continue very happily.
And some might think, well they're not yet available.
Well they are.
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them,
and one of them is here in the audience,
Marian Peeters, who's in the picture.
I predict that later this year, you'll get them in the supermarkets --
not visible, but as animal protein
in the food.
And maybe by 2020,
you'll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you're going to eat.
And they're being made in the most wonderful ways.
A Dutch chocolate maker.
(Music)
(Applause)
So there's even a lot of design to it.
and she puts the insects on the menu
in her restaurant in her ministry.
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
over to the Hague recently,
she went to a high-class restaurant,
and they ate insects all together.
It's not something that is a hobby of mine.
It's really taken off the ground.
So why not eat insects?
You should try it yourself.
A couple of years ago, we had 1,750 people all together
in a square in Wageningen town,
and they ate insects at the same moment,
and this was still big, big news.
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects,
because it's just a normal way of doing.
and I would say, enjoy.
And I'm going to show to Bruno some first tries,
and he can have the first bite.
And it looks delicious.
They just make it [with] nuts or something.
Hello. My name is Birke Baehr,
and I'm 11 years old.
I came here today to talk about what's wrong with our food system.
First of all, I would like to say
that I'm really amazed at how easily kids are led to believe
all the marketing and advertising
on TV, at public schools
and pretty much everywhere else you look.
It seems to me like corporations
are always trying to get kids, like me,
to get their parents to buy stuff
that really isn't good for us or the planet.
Little kids, especially,
are attracted by colorful packaging
and plastic toys.
I must admit, I used to be one of them.
I also used to think that all of our food
came from these happy, little farms
where pigs rolled in mud and cows grazed on grass all day.
I began to look into this stuff
on the Internet, in books and in documentary films,
in my travels with my family.
I discovered the dark side of the industrialized food system.
First, there's genetically engineered seeds and organisms.
That is when a seed is manipulated in a laboratory
to do something not intended by nature --
like taking the DNA of a fish
and putting it into the DNA of a tomato. Yuck.
Don't get me wrong, I like fish and tomatoes,
but this is just creepy.
(Laughter)
The seeds are then planted, then grown.
The food they produce have been proven
to cause cancer and other problems in lab animals,
and people have been eating food produced this way
since the 1990s.
And most folks don't even know they exist.
Did you know rats that ate genetically engineered corn
had developed signs of liver and kidney toxicity?
These include kidney inflammation and lesions and increased kidney weight.
Yet almost all the corn we eat
has been altered genetically in some way.
And let me tell you,
corn is in everything.
And don't even get me started on the Confined Animal Feeding Operations
called CAFOS.
made from fossil fuels
that they mix with the dirt to make plants grow.
They do this because they've stripped the soil from all nutrients
from growing the same crop over and over again.
Next, more harmful chemicals are sprayed on fruits and vegetables,
like pesticides and herbicides,
to kill weeds and bugs.
When it rains, these chemicals seep into the ground,
or run off into our waterways,
poisoning our water too.
Then they irradiate our food, trying to make it last longer,
so it can travel thousands of miles
from where it's grown to the supermarkets.
how can I change? How can I change these things?
This is what I found out.
I discovered that there's a movement for a better way.
Now a while back,
I wanted to be an NFL football player.
I decided that I'd rather be an organic farmer instead.
(Applause)
Thank you.
And that way I can have a greater impact on the world.
This man, Joel Salatin, they call him a lunatic farmer
because he grows against the system.
Since I'm home-schooled,
I went to go hear him speak one day.
This man, this "lunatic farmer,"
doesn't use any pesticides, herbicides,
or genetically modified seeds.
And so for that, he's called crazy by the system.
by making different choices,
by buying our food directly from local farmers,
or our neighbors who we know in real life.
Some people say organic or local food is more expensive,
but is it really?
With all these things I've been learning about the food system,
it seems to me that we can either pay the farmer,
or we can pay the hospital.
(Applause)
Now I know definitely which one I would choose.
I want you to know that there are farms out there --
like Bill Keener in Sequatchie Cove Farm in Tennessee --
whose cows do eat grass
and whose pigs do roll in the mud, just like I thought.
Sometimes I go to Bill's farm and volunteer,
so I can see up close and personal
where the meat I eat comes from.
I want you to know that I believe
kids will eat fresh vegetables and good food
if they know more about it and where it really comes from.
I want you to know that there are farmers' markets
in every community popping up.
I want you to know that me, my brother and sister
actually like eating baked kale chips.
I try to share this everywhere I go.
my uncle said that he offered my six-year-old cousin cereal.
He asked him if he wanted organic Toasted O's
or the sugarcoated flakes --
you know, the one with the big striped cartoon character on the front.
My little cousin told his dad
that he would rather have the organic Toasted O's cereal
because Birke said he shouldn't eat sparkly cereal.
And that, my friends, is how we can make a difference
one kid at a time.
choose organic, know your farmer and know your food.
Thank you.
I'm here today to share with you
an extraordinary journey -
extraordinarily rewarding journey, actually -
which brought me into
training rats
to save human lives
by detecting landmines
and tuberculosis.
As a child, I had two passions.
One was a passion for rodents.
I had all kinds of rats,
mice, hamsters,
gerbils, squirrels.
You name it, I bred it, and I sold them to pet shops.
(Laughter)
I also had a passion for Africa.
Growing up in a multicultural environment,
we had African students in the house,
and I learned about their stories,
so different backgrounds,
dependency on imported know-how,
goods, services,
exuberant cultural diversity.
Africa was truly fascinating for me.
engineer in product development,
and I focused on appropriate detection technologies,
actually the first appropriate technologies
for developing countries.
I started working in the industry,
but I wasn't really happy to contribute
to a material consumer society
in a linear, extracting
and manufacturing mode.
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem:
landmines.
We're talking '95 now.
Princess Diana is announcing on TV
that landmines form a structural barrier
to any development, which is really true.
As long as these devices are there,
or there is suspicion of landmines,
you can't really enter into the land.
Actually, there was an appeal worldwide
for new detectors
sustainable in the environments
where they're needed to produce,
which is mainly in the developing world.
We chose rats.
Because, aren't they vermin?
Well, actually rats are,
in contrary to what most people think about them,
rats are highly sociable creatures.
And actually, our product -- what you see here.
There's a target somewhere here.
You see an operator, a trained African
with his rats in front
who actually are left and right.
There, the animal finds a mine.
It scratches on the soil.
And the animal comes back for a food reward.
Very, very simple.
Very sustainable in this environment.
Here, the animal gets its food reward.
And that's how it works.
Very, very simple.
Rats have been used since the '50s last century,
in all kinds of experiments.
Rats have more genetic material
allocated to olfaction
than any other mammal species.
They're extremely sensitive to smell.
Moreover, they have the mechanisms to map all these smells
and to communicate about it.
Now how do we communicate with rats?
Well don't talk rat,
but we have a clicker,
a standard method for animal training,
which you see there.
A clicker, which makes a particular sound
with which you can reinforce particular behaviors.
First of all, we associate the click sound with a food reward,
which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe.
Once the animal knows click, food,
click, food, click, food --
so click is food --
we bring it in a cage with a hole,
and actually the animal learns
to stick the nose in the hole
under which a target scent is placed,
and to do that for five seconds --
five seconds, which is long for a rat.
Once the animal knows this, we make the task a bit more difficult.
It learns how to find the target smell
in a cage with several holes, up to 10 holes.
to walk on a leash in the open
and find targets.
In the next step, animals learn
to find real mines in real minefields.
They are tested and accredited
according to International Mine Action Standards,
just like dogs have to pass a test.
This consists of 400 square meters.
There's a number of mines
placed blindly,
and the team of trainer and their rat
have to find all the targets.
If the animal does that, it gets a license
as an accredited animal
to be operational in the field --
just like dogs, by the way.
Maybe one slight difference:
we can train rats at a fifth of the price
of training the mining dog.
one Tanzanian trainer,
who transfers the skills
to these three Mozambican fellows.
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people.
They have a skill,
which makes them much less dependent
on foreign aid.
Moreover, this small team
together with, of course, you need the heavy vehicles
and the manual de-miners to follow-up.
But with this small investment in a rat capacity,
we have demonstrated in Mozambique
that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter
up to 60 percent
of what is currently normal --
two dollars per square meter, we do it at $1.18,
and we can still bring that price down.
Question of scale.
If you can bring in more rats,
we can actually make the output even bigger.
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique.
Eleven African governments
have seen that they can become less dependent
by using this technology.
They have signed the pact for peace
and treaty in the Great Lakes region,
and they endorse hero rats
to clear their common borders of landmines.
And there's about 6,000 people last year
that walked on a landmine,
but worldwide last year,
almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis
as a first cause of infection.
Especially in Africa
where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked,
there is a huge common problem.
Microscopy, the standard WHO procedure,
reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability.
In Tanzania -- the numbers don't lie --
45 percent of people -- T.B. patients --
get diagnosed with T.B. before they die.
It means that, if you have T.B.,
you have more chance that you won't be detected,
but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on.
And if, however,
you are detected very early, diagnosed early,
treatment can start,
and even in HIV-positives, it makes sense.
You can actually cure T.B.,
even in HIV-positives.
the name for T.B.
is "tering,"
which, etymologically,
refers to the smell of tar.
Already the old Chinese
and the Greek, Hippocrates,
have actually published,
documented, that T.B. can be diagnosed
based on the volatiles
exuding from patients.
So what we did is we collected some samples --
just as a way of testing --
from hospitals,
trained rats on them
and see if this works,
and wonder, well,
we can reach 89 percent sensitivity,
86 percent specificity
using multiple rats in a row.
This is how it works,
and really, this is a generic technology.
We're talking now explosives, tuberculosis,
but can you imagine,
you can actually put anything under there.
You have a cassette with 10 samples.
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage.
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second
to discriminate the scent, so it goes extremely fast.
Here it's already at the third sample.
This is a positive sample.
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward.
And by doing so, very fast,
we can have like a second-line opinion
to see which patients are positive,
which are negative.
Just as an indication,
whereas a microscopist can process
40 samples in a day,
a rat can process
the same amount of samples
in seven minutes only.
A cage like this --
(Applause)
A cage like this -- provided that you have rats,
and we have now currently
25 tuberculosis rats --
a cage like this, operating throughout the day,
can process 1,680 samples.
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications --
environmental detection
of pollutants in soils,
customs applications,
detection of illicit goods in containers and so on.
I just want to briefly highlight,
the blue rods
are the scores of microscopy only
at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam
on a population of 500,000 people,
where 15,000 reported to get a test done.
Microscopy for 1,800 patients.
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats
and looping those results back,
we were able to increase case detection rates
by over 30 percent.
Throughout last year,
we've been -- depending on which intervals you take --
we've been consistently
increasing case detection rates
in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam
between 30 and 40 percent.
So this is really considerable.
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy
infects up to 15 people,
healthy people, per year,
you can be sure
that we have saved lots of lives.
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives.
is now to standardize this technology.
And there are simple things
like, for instance, we have a small laser in the sniffer hole
where the animal has to stick for five seconds.
So, to standardize this.
Also, to standardize the pellets,
the food rewards,
and to semi-automate this
in order to replicate this on a much larger scale
and affect the lives of many more people.
To conclude, there are also other applications at the horizon.
Here is a first prototype
of our camera rat,
which is a rat with a rat backpack
with a camera that can go under rubble
to detect for victims
after earthquake and so on.
This is in a prototype stage.
We don't have a working system here yet.
you may think this is about rats, these projects,
but in the end it is about people.
It is about empowering vulnerable communities
to tackle difficult, expensive
and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks,
and doing that with a local resource,
plenty available.
So something completely different
is to keep on challenging your perception
about the resources surrounding you,
whether they are environmental,
technological, animal, or human.
And to respectfully harmonize with them
in order to foster a sustainable world.
to the second son, he left a third of the camels;
Brotherly tempers started to get strained.
Finally, in desperation,
they went and they consulted a wise old woman.
They gave it back to the wise old woman.
We're all one family.
We know that scientifically,
thanks to the communications revolution,
How do we deal with our deepest differences,
That's the question.

trying to work, getting involved in conflicts
It's actually surprisingly simple.
It's not easy, but it's simple.
who can play a constructive role.
and I had an extra month,
living pretty much like our ancestors lived
for maybe 99 percent of the human story.
So how do they deal with their differences?
and they sit and they talk and they talk.
or better yet -- a reconciliation.
And if tempers are still too high,
given our human tendencies.
there's always two sides --
it's Arabs versus Israelis, labor versus management,
the family members, the neighbors.
And we can play an incredibly constructive role.
is to remind the parties of what's really at stake.
when we're involved in conflict,
it's very easy to lose perspective.
And as the saying goes,
when angry, you will make the best speech
where we can keep our eyes on the prize.
There was a war going on, as you know.
Look at what you Americans are doing in Puerto Rico."
and everyone looked at me for a response,
to stop the suffering and the bloodshed in Chechnya."
That's the role of the third side,
to help the parties go to the balcony.
Question is: where's the third side there?
How could we possibly go to the balcony?
something that any one of us could do as third-siders.
Why do we pay so much attention to this conflict?
Is it the number of deaths?
we feel we have a personal stake in it.
And so my question is --
he's the father of us all.
the interconnectedness of it all, the unity of it all.
That's what he's known for, his hospitality.
What is terrorism?
Terrorism is basically taking an innocent stranger
which is a third-side story,
what if that could be --
because Abraham stands for hospitality --
How would you bring that story to life?
And that was my thinking of how would you do that.
And that's what comes to the first step here.
You go for a walk in the footsteps of Abraham.
You retrace the footsteps of Abraham.
Because walking has a real power.
You know, as an anthropologist, walking is what made us human.
Now if I were to come to you face-to-face
and come this close to you,
you would feel threatened.
Who fights while they walk?
That's why in negotiations, often, when things get tough,
people go for walks in the woods.
Then we crossed the border into Syria, went to Aleppo,
So effectively, we went from womb to tomb.

he's alive, he's a living presence.

more women than men, actually, interestingly.
uniting the different communities.
The media love it; they really adore it.
And this woman right here, Um Ahmad,
is a woman who lives on the path in Northern Jordan.
She's desperately poor.
But what she can do is cook.
She makes the most delicious food,
that's fresh from the herbs in the surrounding countryside.
And so more and more walkers have come,
And so she told our team there, she said,
"You have made me visible
The potential is basically to change the game.
The path right now is like an acorn;
it's still in its early phase.
What would the oak tree look like?
When I think back to my childhood,
But they did it, thanks to a common identity, Europe,
and a common economy.
So my question is, if it can be done in Europe,
why not in the Middle East?
It's not easy, of course.
It was done in South Africa.
It was done in Northern Ireland.
It could be done anywhere.
We're about to take a break in a moment.
Just go up to someone
who's from a different culture, a different country,
That's a third-side act.
That's walking Abraham's Path.
After a TED Talk,
can take the world, can bring the world
There's an old African proverb that goes:
So today, I'm going to tell you about some people
who didn't move out of their neighborhoods.
The first one is happening right here in Chicago.
Brenda Palms-Farber was hired
to help ex-convicts reenter society
and keep them from going back into prison.
Currently, taxpayers spend
about 60,000 dollars per year
sending a person to jail.
We know that two-thirds of them are going to go back.
I find it interesting that, for every one dollar
we spend, however, on early childhood education,
like Head Start,
we save 17 dollars
on stuff like incarceration in the future.
Or -- think about it -- that 60,000 dollars
is more than what it costs
to send one person to Harvard as well.
took a look at her challenge
and came up
with a not-so-obvious solution:
create a business
that produces skin care products from honey.
Okay, it might be obvious to some of you; it wasn't to me.
It's the basis of growing a form of social innovation
that has real potential.
She hired seemingly unemployable men and women
to care for the bees, harvest the honey
and make value-added products
that they marketed themselves,
and that were later sold at Whole Foods.
She combined employment experience and training
with life skills they needed,
like anger-management and teamwork,
and also how to talk to future employers
about how their experiences
actually demonstrated the lessons that they had learned
and their eagerness to learn more.
Less than four percent
of the folks that went through her program
actually go back to jail.
So these young men and women learned job-readiness
and life skills through bee keeping
and became productive citizens in the process.
Talk about a sweet beginning.
and lots of people know
that L.A. has its issues.
But I'm going to talk about L.A.'s water issues right now.
They have not enough water on most days
and too much to handle when it rains.
Currently, 20 percent
of California's energy consumption
is used to pump water
into mostly Southern California.
Their spending loads, loads,
to channel that rainwater out into the ocean
when it rains and floods as well.
Now Andy Lipkis is working to help
L.A. cut infrastructure costs
associated with water management and urban heat island --
linking trees, people and technology
to create a more livable city.
All that green stuff actually naturally absorbs storm water,
also helps cool our cities.
Because, come to think about it,
do you really want air-conditioning,
or is it a cooler room that you want?
How you get it shouldn't make that much of a difference.
L.A. County
decided that they needed to spend 2.5 billion dollars
to repair the city schools.
And Andy and his team discovered
that they were going to spend 200 million of those dollars
on asphalt to surround the schools themselves.
And by presenting a really strong economic case,
they convinced the L.A. government
that replacing that asphalt
with trees and other greenery,
that the schools themselves would save the system more on energy
than they spend on horticultural infrastructure.
So ultimately, 20 million square feet of asphalt
was replaced or avoided,
and electrical consumption for air-conditioning went down,
while employment
for people to maintain those grounds went up,
resulting in a net-savings to the system,
but also healthier students and schools system employees as well.
is a coal miner's daughter.
Her family has eight generations
in a town called Whitesville, West Virginia.
And if anyone should be clinging
to the former glory of the coal mining history,
and of the town,
it should be Judy.
But the way coal is mined right now is different
from the deep mines that her father
and her father's father would go down into
and that employed essentially thousands and thousands of people.
Now, two dozen men
can tear down a mountain in several months,
and only for about a few years' worth of coal.
That kind of technology is called "mountaintop removal."
It can make a mountain go from this to this
in a few short months.
Just imagine that the air surrounding these places --
it's filled with the residue of explosives and coal.
When we visited, it gave some of the people we were with
this strange little cough
after being only there for just a few hours or so --
not just miners, but everybody.
and her water poisoned.
And the coal companies just move on
after the mountain was emptied,
leaving even more unemployment in their wake.
But she also saw the difference in potential wind energy
on an intact mountain,
and one that was reduced in elevation
by over 2,000 feet.
Three years of dirty energy with not many jobs,
or centuries of clean energy
with the potential for developing expertise and improvements in efficiency
based on technical skills,
and developing local knowledge
about how to get the most out of that region's wind.
She calculated the up-front cost
and the payback over time,
and it's a net-plus on so many levels
for the local, national and global economy.
It's a longer payback than mountaintop removal,
but the wind energy actually pays back forever.
Now mountaintop removal pays very little money to the locals,
and it gives them a lot of misery.
The water is turned into goo.
Most people are still unemployed,
leading to most of the same kinds of social problems
that unemployed people in inner cities also experience --
drug and alcohol abuse,
domestic abuse, teen pregnancy and poor heath, as well.
totally related to each other.
Not quite an obvious alliance.
I mean, literally, her hometown is called Whitesville, West Virginia.
I mean, they are not --
they ain't competing for the birthplace of hip hop title
or anything like that.
But the back of my T-shirt, the one that she gave me,
says, "Save the endangered hillbillies."
So homegirls and hillbillies we got it together
and totally understand that this is what it's all about.
But just a few months ago,
Judy was diagnosed
with stage-three lung cancer.
Yeah.
And it has since moved to her bones and her brain.
And I just find it so bizarre
that she's suffering from the same thing
that she tried so hard to protect people from.
But her dream
of Coal River Mountain Wind
is her legacy.
And she might not
get to see that mountaintop.
But rather than writing
yet some kind of manifesto or something,
she's leaving behind
a business plan to make it happen.
That's what my homegirl is doing.
So I'm so proud of that.
don't know each other,
but they do have an awful lot in common.
They're all problem solvers,
and they're just some of the many examples
that I really am privileged to see, meet and learn from
in the examples of the work that I do now.
I was really lucky to have them all featured
on my Corporation for Public Radio radio show
called ThePromisedLand.org.
Now they're all very practical visionaries.
They take a look at the demands that are out there --
beauty products, healthy schools, electricity --
and how the money's flowing to meet those demands.
And when the cheapest solutions
involve reducing the number of jobs,
you're left with unemployed people,
and those people aren't cheap.
In fact, they make up some of what I call the most expensive citizens,
and they include generationally impoverished,
traumatized vets returning from the Middle East,
people coming out of jail.
And for the veterans in particular,
the V.A. said there's a six-fold increase
in mental health pharmaceuticals by vets since 2003.
I think that number's probably going to go up.
They're not the largest number of people,
but they are some of the most expensive --
and in terms of the likelihood for domestic abuse, drug and alcohol abuse,
poor performance by their kids in schools
and also poor health as a result of stress.
So these three guys all understand
how to productively channel dollars
through our local economies
to meet existing market demands,
reduce the social problems that we have now
and prevent new problems in the future.
One problem: waste handling and unemployment.
Even when we think or talk about recycling,
lots of recyclable stuff ends up getting incinerated or in landfills
and leaving many municipalities, diversion rates --
they leave much to be recycled.
And where is this waste handled? Usually in poor communities.
And we know that eco-industrial business, these kinds of business models --
there's a model in Europe called the eco-industrial park,
where either the waste of one company is the raw material for another,
or you use recycled materials
to make goods that you can actually use and sell.
We can create these local markets and incentives
for recycled materials
to be used as raw materials for manufacturing.
And in my hometown, we actually tried to do one of these in the Bronx,
but our mayor decided what he wanted to see
was a jail on that same spot.
Fortunately -- because we wanted to create hundreds of jobs --
but after many years,
the city wanted to build a jail.
They've since abandoned that project, thank goodness.
Working-class and poor urban Americans
are not benefiting economically
from our current food system.
It relies too much on transportation,
chemical fertilization, big use of water
and also refrigeration.
Mega agricultural operations
often are responsible for poisoning our waterways and our land,
and it produces this incredibly unhealthy product
that costs us billions in healthcare
and lost productivity.
And so we know "urban ag"
is a big buzz topic this time of the year,
but it's mostly gardening,
which has some value in community building -- lots of it --
but it's not in terms of creating jobs
or for food production.
The numbers just aren't there.
Part of my work now is really laying the groundwork
to integrate urban ag and rural food systems
to hasten the demise of the 3,000-mile salad
by creating a national brand of urban-grown produce
in every city,
that uses regional growing power
and augments it with indoor growing facilities,
owned and operated by small growers,
where now there are only consumers.
This can support seasonal farmers around metro areas
who are losing out because they really can't meet
the year-round demand for produce.
It's not a competition with rural farm;
it's actually reinforcements.
It allies in a really positive
and economically viable food system.
for hospitals,
senior centers, schools, daycare centers,
and produce a network of regional jobs, as well.
This is smart infrastructure.
And how we manage our built environment
affects the health and well-being of people every single day.
Our municipalities, rural and urban,
play the operational course of infrastructure --
things like waste disposal, energy demand,
as well as social costs of unemployment, drop-out rates, incarceration rates
and the impacts of various public health costs.
Smart infrastructure can provide cost-saving ways
for municipalities to handle
both infrastructure and social needs.
And we want to shift the systems
that open the doors for people who were formerly tax burdens
to become part of the tax base.
And imagine a national business model
that creates local jobs and smart infrastructure
to improve local economic stability.
So I'm hoping you can see a little theme here.
I haven't created it, and it's not happening by accident.
I'm noticing that it's happening all over the country,
and the good news is that it's growing.
And we all need to be invested in it.
It is an essential pillar to this country's recovery.
And I call it "hometown security."
The recession has us reeling and fearful,
and there's something in the air these days
that is also very empowering.
It's a realization
that we are the key
to our own recovery.
Now is the time for us to act in our own communities
where we think local and we act local.
And when we do that, our neighbors --
be they next-door, or in the next state,
or in the next country --
will be just fine.
The sum of the local is the global.
Hometown security means rebuilding our natural defenses,
putting people to work,
restoring our natural systems.
Hometown security means creating wealth here at home,
instead of destroying it overseas.
Tackling social and environmental problems
at the same time with the same solution
yields great cost savings,
wealth generation and national security.
Many great and inspiring solutions
have been generated across America.
The challenge for us now
is to identify and support countless more.
but it's not like the old saying,
"charity begins at home."
I recently read a book called "Love Leadership" by John Hope Bryant.
And it's about leading in a world
that really does seem to be operating on the basis of fear.
And reading that book made me reexamine that theory
because I need to explain what I mean by that.
See, my dad
was a great, great man in many ways.
He grew up in the segregated South,
escaped lynching and all that
during some really hard times,
and he provided a really stable home for me and my siblings
and a whole bunch of other people that fell on hard times.
But, like all of us, he had some problems.
(Laughter)
And his was gambling,
compulsively.
To him that phrase, "Charity begins at home,"
meant that my payday -- or someone else's --
would just happen to coincide with his lucky day.
So you need to help him out.
And sometimes I would loan him money
from my after-school or summer jobs,
and he always had the great intention
of paying me back with interest,
of course, after he hit it big.
And he did sometimes, believe it or not,
at a racetrack in Los Angeles --
one reason to love L.A. -- back in the 1940s.
He made 15,000 dollars cash
and bought the house that I grew up in.
So I'm not that unhappy about that.
But listen, I did feel obligated to him,
and I grew up -- then I grew up.
And I'm a grown woman now,
and I have learned a few things along the way.
often is just about giving,
because you're supposed to,
or because it's what you've always done,
or it's about giving until it hurts.
I'm about providing the means
to build something that will grow
and intensify its original investment
and not just require greater giving next year --
I'm not trying to feed the habit.
I spent some years
watching how good intentions for community empowerment,
that were supposed to be there
to support the community and empower it,
actually left people
in the same, if not worse, position that they were in before.
And over the past 20 years,
we've spent record amounts of philanthropic dollars
on social problems,
yet educational outcomes,
malnutrition, incarceration,
obesity, diabetes, income disparity,
they've all gone up with some exceptions --
in particular, infant mortality
among people in poverty --
but it's a great world that we're bringing them into as well.
because, for many years, I spent a long time
in the non-profit industrial complex,
and I'm a recovering executive director,
two years clean.
(Laughter)
But during that time, I realized that it was about projects
and developing them on the local level
that really was going to do the right thing for our communities.
But I really did struggle for financial support.
The greater our success,
the less money came in from foundations.
And I tell you, being on the TED stage
and winning a MacArthur in the same exact year
gave everyone the impression that I had arrived.
And by the time I'd moved on,
I was actually covering a third
of my agency's budget deficit with speaking fees.
And I think because early on, frankly,
my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time.
But since then,
the park that was just a dump and was featured at a TED2006 Talk
became this little thing.
But I did in fact get married in it.
Over here.
There goes my dog who led me to the park in my wedding.
The South Bronx Greenway
was also just a drawing on the stage back in 2006.
Since then, we got
about 50 million dollars in stimulus package money
to come and get here.
And we love this, because I love construction now,
because we're watching these things actually happen.
the critical importance
of shifting charity into enterprise.
I started my firm to help communities across the country
realize their own potential
to improve everything about the quality of life for their people.
Hometown security
is next on my to-do list.
What we need are people who see the value
in investing in these types of local enterprises,
who will partner with folks like me
to identify the growth trends and climate adaptation
as well as understand the growing social costs
of business as usual.
We need to work together
to embrace and repair our land,
repair our power systems
and repair ourselves.
It's time to stop building
the shopping malls, the prisons,
the stadiums
and other tributes to all of our collective failures.
It is time that we start building
living monuments to hope and possibility.
I have a few pictures,
This is the first house I built.
And these buttons there --
even the lockset is probably worth 200 dollars.
you see there are bulges and pokes and sags and so forth.
Well, if that ruins your life,
well, then, you shouldn't live there.
and then the door flies open and you throw your laundry down.
made out of scrap two-by-four.
then did the two profiles on this side.
It's a two-person tub.
After all, it's not just a question of hygiene,
then the dentil work comes directly off the can's red, white, blue and silver.
Then, these corbels going down underneath the eaves
Then, on the can it says,
And they gave me the fence, but they didn't give me the shaper,
so we made a deadbolt out of it.
That'll keep bull elephants out, I promise.
Then, another bathroom upstairs.
Don't put it in the foyer.
Our housing has become a commodity,
and I'll talk a little bit about that.
But the first cause of waste is probably even buried in our DNA.
What it means is, for every perception we have,
So I can show you an object you've never seen before.
Oh, that's a cell phone.
But you've never seen this one before.
and then you go through your databanks:
Cell phone. Oh! That's a cell phone.
right between cell phones and chocolate.
tolerant of organic texture and human gesture.
they'll get out a transit
Dumpster.
then got a little jump start along about the French Revolution.
"Jim, now it's time. You're the down -- oh!"
So we hired on.
I can see how you might say that.
But right now, I'm saving you five dollars a minute.
Do the math."
And the irony is that he wasn't very good at math.
and we force environmental resources to accommodate that.
just like furniture, just like a car.
You write the check, and instantly, it depreciates 30 percent.
Are we just being numbingly stupid?
The walls are this thick.
The whole thing has the structural value of corn.
is what the building industry is predicated on,
all the tradesmen, vendors,
inspectors, engineers, architects
all think like this.
It's a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can't get out of it.
Then here come the marketeers and the advertisers.
"Woo. Woo-hoo."
I can eat like a backhoe.
I can wipe my mouth on my sleeve, napkin on the table,
chew with my mouth open, make little noises,
scratch wherever I want.
I go, "Oops! Lil' spaghetti sauce there."
Napkin in my lap, half-bites,
chew with my mouth closed, no scratching.
and I'm living my life according to what you expect me to do.
That exacerbates and continues this model.
Human beings are a social species.
We do what that group does
that we're trying to identify with.
So along about September,
they can stride in and go,
I see you don't have designer jeans.
Right there is reason enough to have uniforms.
And so that happens in the building industry as well.
shelter, clothing, food, water, mating and so forth.
Second: security. Third: relationships.
Fourth: status, self-esteem -- that is, vanity --
with vain decisions,
and not make our housing a commodity,
and, darn it, once in a while, you fail.
but you know, this just isn't going to work.
And your instinct is to say,
"Well, why don't you suck an egg?"
we sprawl just a little bit.
We're in trouble.
And I don't wear ammo belts crisscrossing my chest
and a red bandana.
But we're clearly in trouble.
If it doesn't work, take it down.
What we need to do is reconnect with who we really are,
and that's thrilling indeed.
I woke up in the middle of the night
with the sound of heavy explosion.
It was deep at night.
I do not remember what time it was.
I just remember the sound
was so heavy
and so very shocking.
Everything in my room was shaking --
my heart, my windows,
my bed, everything.
I looked out the windows
and I saw a full half-circle
of explosion.
I thought it was just like the movies,
but the movies had not conveyed them
in the powerful image that I was seeing
full of bright red
and orange and gray,
and a full circle of explosion.
And I kept on staring at it
until it disappeared.
I went back to my bed,
and I prayed,
and I secretly thanked God
that that missile
did not land on my family's home,
that it did not kill my family that night.
Thirty years have passed,
and I still feel guilty about that prayer,
for the next day, I learned that that missile
landed on my brother's friend's home
and killed him
and his father,
but did not kill his mother or his sister.
His mother showed up the next week
at my brother's classroom
and begged seven-year-old kids
to share with her any picture they may have
of her son,
for she had lost everything.
of a nameless survivor of war,
and nameless refugees,
whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers
and our TV
with tattered clothes,
dirty face, scared eyes.
This is not a story of a nameless someone
who lived in some war,
who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,
their accomplishments, their families,
their beliefs, their values.
This is my story.
I was that girl.
I am another image and vision
of another survivor of war.
I am that refugee,
and I am that girl.
You see,
I grew up in war-torn Iraq,
and I believe that there are two sides of wars
and we've only seen
one side of it.
We only talk about
one side of it.
But there's another side
that I have witnessed
as someone who lived in it
and someone who ended up working in it.
the red colors of fire and blood,
the brown tones of earth
as it explodes
in our faces
and the piercing silver
of an exploded missile,
so bright
that nothing can protect your eyes from it.
I grew up
with the sounds of war --
the staccato sounds of gunfire,
the wrenching booms of explosions,
ominous drones of jets flying overhead
and the wailing warning sounds
of sirens.
These are the sounds you would expect,
but they are also the sounds
of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds
screeching in the night,
the high-pitched honest cries
of children
and the thunderous,
unbearable
silence.
"War," a friend of mine said,
"is not about sound at all.
It is actually about silence,
the silence of humanity."
and founded a group called Women for Women International
that ends up working
with women survivors of wars.
In my travels and in my work,
from Congo to Afghanistan,
from Sudan to Rwanda,
I have learned not only
that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,
but the fears of war are the same.
You know, there is a fear of dying,
and do not believe any movie character
where the hero is not afraid.
It is very scary
to go through that feeling
of "I am about to die"
or "I could die in this explosion."
But there's also the fear
of losing loved ones,
and I think that's even worse.
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --
as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,
who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;
she said, "The fear
of losing
the 'I' in me,
the fear of losing
the 'I' in me."
That's what my mother in Iraq
used to tell me.
It's like dying from inside-out.
A Palestinian woman once told me,
"It is not about the fear of one death,"
she said, "sometimes I feel
I die 10 times in one day,"
as she was describing the marches of soldiers
and the sounds of their bullets.
She said, "But it's not fair,
because there is only one life,
and there should only be one death."
one side of war.
We have only been discussing and consumed
with high-level preoccupations
over troop levels, drawdown timelines,
surges and sting operations,
when we should be examining the details
of where the social fabric
has been most torn,
where the community has improvised
and survived
and shown acts of resilience
and amazing courage
just to keep life going.
We have been so consumed
with seemingly objective discussions
of politics, tactics,
weapons, dollars
and casualties.
This is the language
of sterility.
we treat casualties
in the context of this topic.
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties
as inevitabilities.
Eighty percent of refugees around the world
are women and children. Oh.
Ninety percent of modern war casualties
are civilians.
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.
How interesting.
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda
get raped in 100 days.
Or, as we speak now,
hundreds of thousands of Congolese women
are getting raped and mutilated.
How interesting.
These just become numbers that we refer to.
The front of wars
is increasingly non-human eyes
peering down on our perceived enemies
from space,
guiding missiles toward unseen targets,
while the human conduct
of the orchestra of media relations
in the event that this particular drone attack
hits a villager
instead of an extremist.
It is a chess game.
You learn to play an international relations school
on your way out and up
to national and international leadership.
Checkmate.
a completely other side of wars.
We are missing my mother's story,
who made sure with every siren, with every raid,
with every cut off-of electricity,
she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,
so we would not be scared
of the sounds of explosions.
We are missing the story of Fareeda,
a music teacher,
a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,
who made sure
that she kept the music school open
every single day
in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo
and walked to that school,
despite the snipers shooting
at that school and at her,
and kept the piano, the violin, the cello
playing the whole duration of the war,
with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.
That was her fight.
That was her resistance.
We are missing the story of Nehia,
a Palestinian woman in Gaza
who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,
she left out of home,
collected all the flour
and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,
in case there is no cease-fire the day after.
We are missing
the stories of Violet,
who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,
she kept on going on,
burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.
We are missing stories of women
who are literally keeping life going
in the midst of wars.
Do you know --
do you know that people fall in love in war
and go to school
and go to factories and hospitals
and get divorced and go dancing and go playing
and live life going?
And the ones who are keeping that life
are women.
There is a side that fights,
and there is a side that keeps the schools
and the factories and the hospitals open.
There is a side that is focused on winning battles,
and there is a side that is focused
on winning life.
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,
and there is a side
that leads the back-line discussion.
There is a side that thinks
that peace is the end of fighting,
and there is a side that thinks
that peace is the arrival
of schools and jobs.
There is a side
that is led by men,
and there is a side
that is led by women.
And in order for us to understand
how do we build lasting peace,
we must understand war and peace
from both sides.
We must have a full picture
of what that means.
what actually peace means,
we need to understand,
as one Sudanese woman once told me,
"Peace is the fact that my toenails
are growing back again."
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,
for 20 years of war,
where it killed one million people
and displaced five million refugees.
Many women were taken as slaves
by rebels and soldiers,
as sexual slaves who were forced also
to carry the ammunition and the water
and the food for the soldiers.
So that woman walked for 20 years,
so she would not be kidnapped again.
And only when there was some sort of peace,
her toenails grew back again.
We need to understand peace
from a toenail's perspective.
that we cannot actually have negotiations
of ending of wars or peace
without fully including women
at the negotiating table.
I find it amazing
that the only group of people
who are not fighting and not killing
and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,
and the group of people who are mostly --
though not exclusively --
who are keeping life going in the midst of war,
are not included in the negotiating table.
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,
but there are also men
who are excluded from that discussion.
The doctors who are not fighting,
the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,
they are, too, excluded
from the negotiating tables.
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,
building of democracy, sustainable economies,
any kind of stabilities,
if we do not fully include women
at the negotiating table.
Not one, but 50 percent.
if we don't start investing
in women and girls.
Did you know
that one year
of the world's military spending
equals 700 years
of the U.N. budget
and equals 2,928 years
of the U.N. budget allocated for women?
If we just reverse
that distribution of funds,
perhaps we could have
a better lasting peace in this world.
And last, but not least,
we need to invest in peace and women,
not only because it is the right thing to do,
not only because it is the right thing to do,
for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,
but it is for the future.
who was telling me about
how her children saw their father killed in front of them
and saw her raped in front of them
and mutilated in front of them,
and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling
killed in front of them,
how they're doing okay right now.
She got into Women for Women International's program.
She got a support network.
She learned about her rights.
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.
She said, "But what I worry about the most
is not any of that.
I worry that my children
have hate in their hearts,
and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again
the killers of their father and their brother."
We need to invest in women,
because that's our only chance
to ensure that there is no more war
in the future.
That mother has a better chance to heal her children
than any peace agreement can do.
To start with, these women that I told you about
are dancing and singing every single day,
and if they can,
who are we not to dance?
That girl that I told you about
ended up starting Women for Women International Group
that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,
and I started this from zero,
nothing, nada, [unclear].
in spite of their circumstances,
not because of it.
Think of how the world can be a much better place
if, for a change,
we have a better equality,
we have equality,
we have a representation
and we understand war,
both from the front-line
and the back-line discussion.
says, "Out beyond the worlds
of right-doings and wrong-doings,
there is a field.
I will meet you there.
When the soul lies down in that grass,
the world is too full
to talk about.
Ideas, language,
even the phrase 'each other'
no longer makes any sense."
I humbly add -- humbly add --
that out beyond
the worlds of war and peace,
there is a field,
and there are many women and men
[who] are meeting there.
Let us make this field a much bigger place.
Let us all meet in that field.
Delighted to be here
and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart,
which is beauty.
I do the philosophy of art, aesthetics,
actually, for a living.
I try to figure out intellectually,
philosophically, psychologically,
what the experience of beauty is,
what sensibly can be said about it
and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it.
Now this is an extremely complicated subject,
in part because the things that we call beautiful
are so different.
I mean just think of the sheer variety --
a baby's face,
Berlioz's "Harold in Italy,"
movies like "The Wizard of Oz"
or the plays of Chekhov,
a central California landscape,
a Hokusai view of Mt. Fuji,
"Der Rosenkavalier,"
a stunning match-winning goal
in a World Cup soccer match,
Van Gogh's "Starry Night,"
a Jane Austen novel,
Fred Astaire dancing across the screen.
This brief list includes human beings,
natural landforms,
works of art and skilled human actions.
An account that explains the presence of beauty
in everything on this list
is not going to be easy.
of what I regard
as the most powerful theory of beauty
we yet have.
And we get it not from a philosopher of art,
not from a postmodern art theorist
or a bigwig art critic.
No, this theory
comes from an expert
on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding,
and you know who I mean:
Charles Darwin.
Of course, a lot of people think they already know
the proper answer to the question,
"What is beauty?"
It's in the eye of the beholder.
It's whatever moves you personally.
Or, as some people,
especially academics prefer,
beauty is in the culturally conditioned
eye of the beholder.
People agree that paintings or movies or music
are beautiful
because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste.
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts
travel across cultures
with great ease.
Beethoven is adored in Japan.
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints.
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures
in British museums,
while Shakespeare is translated
into every major language of the Earth.
Or just think about American jazz
or American movies --
they go everywhere.
There are many differences among the arts,
but there are also universal,
cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures
and values.
this universality?
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct
a Darwinian evolutionary history
of our artistic and aesthetic tastes.
We need to reverse-engineer
our present artistic tastes and preferences
and explain how they came
to be engraved in our minds
by the actions of both our prehistoric,
largely pleistocene environments,
where we became fully human,
but also by the social situations
in which we evolved.
This reverse engineering
can also enlist help
from the human record
preserved in prehistory.
I mean fossils, cave paintings and so forth.
And it should take into account
what we know of the aesthetic interests
of isolated hunter-gatherer bands
that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries.
have no doubt whatsoever
that the experience of beauty,
with its emotional intensity and pleasure,
belongs to our evolved human psychology.
The experience of beauty is one component
in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations.
Beauty is an adaptive effect,
which we extend
and intensify
in the creation and enjoyment
of works of art and entertainment.
As many of you will know,
evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms.
The first of these is natural selection --
that's random mutation and selective retention --
along with our basic anatomy and physiology --
the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails.
Natural selection also explains
many basic revulsions,
such as the horrid smell of rotting meat,
or fears, such as the fear of snakes
or standing close to the edge of a cliff.
Natural selection also explains pleasures --
sexual pleasure,
our liking for sweet, fat and proteins,
which in turn explains a lot of popular foods,
from ripe fruits through chocolate malts
and barbecued ribs.
is sexual selection,
and it operates very differently.
The peacock's magnificent tail
is the most famous example of this.
It did not evolve for natural survival.
In fact, it goes against natural survival.
No, the peacock's tail
results from the mating choices
made by peahens.
It's quite a familiar story.
It's women who actually push history forward.
Darwin himself, by the way,
had no doubts that the peacock's tail
was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen.
He actually used that word.
Now, keeping these ideas firmly in mind,
we can say that the experience of beauty
is one of the ways that evolution has
of arousing and sustaining
interest or fascination,
even obsession,
in order to encourage us
toward making the most adaptive decisions
for survival and reproduction.
Beauty is nature's way
of acting at a distance,
so to speak.
I mean, you can't expect to eat
an adaptively beneficial landscape.
It would hardly do to eat your baby
or your lover.
So evolution's trick
is to make them beautiful,
to have them exert a kind of magnetism
to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them.
the magnetic pull
of beautiful landscapes.
People in very different cultures
all over the world
tend to like a particular kind of landscape,
a landscape that just happens to be similar
to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved.
This landscape shows up today
on calendars, on postcards,
in the design of golf courses and public parks
and in gold-framed pictures
that hang in living rooms
from New York to New Zealand.
It's a kind of Hudson River school landscape
featuring open spaces
of low grasses
interspersed with copses of trees.
The trees, by the way, are often preferred
if they fork near the ground,
that is to say, if they're trees you could scramble up
if you were in a tight fix.
The landscape shows the presence
of water directly in view,
or evidence of water in a bluish distance,
indications of animal or bird life
as well as diverse greenery
and finally -- get this --
a path
or a road,
perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline,
that extends into the distance,
almost inviting you to follow it.
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful,
even by people in countries
that don't have it.
The ideal savanna landscape
is one of the clearest examples
where human beings everywhere
find beauty
in similar visual experience.
that's natural beauty.
How about artistic beauty?
Isn't that exhaustively cultural?
No, I don't think it is.
And once again, I'd like to look back to prehistory
to say something about it.
It is widely assumed
that the earliest human artworks
are the stupendously skillful cave paintings
that we all know from Lascaux
and Chauvet.
Chauvet caves
are about 32,000 years old,
along with a few small, realistic sculptures
of women and animals from the same period.
But artistic and decorative skills
are actually much older than that.
Beautiful shell necklaces
that look like something you'd see at an arts and crafts fair,
as well as ochre body paint,
have been found
from around 100,000 years ago.
are older even than this.
I have in mind
the so-called Acheulian hand axes.
The oldest stone tools are choppers
from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa.
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years.
These crude tools
were around for thousands of centuries,
until around 1.4 million years ago
when Homo erectus
started shaping
single, thin stone blades,
sometimes rounded ovals,
but often in what are to our eyes
an arresting, symmetrical pointed leaf
or teardrop form.
These Acheulian hand axes --
they're named after St. Acheul in France,
where finds were made in 19th century --
have been unearthed in their thousands,
scattered across Asia, Europe and Africa,
almost everywhere Homo erectus
and Homo ergaster roamed.
Now, the sheer numbers of these hand axes
shows that they can't have been made
for butchering animals.
And the plot really thickens when you realize
that, unlike other pleistocene tools,
the hand axes often exhibit
no evidence of wear
on their delicate blade edges.
And some, in any event, are too big
to use for butchery.
Their symmetry, their attractive materials
and, above all,
their meticulous workmanship
are simply quite beautiful
to our eyes, even today.
I mean, they're ancient, they're foreign,
but they're at the same time
somehow familiar.
What were these artifacts for?
The best available answer
is that they were literally
the earliest known works of art,
practical tools transformed
into captivating aesthetic objects,
contemplated both for their elegant shape
and their virtuoso craftsmanship.
Hand axes mark
an evolutionary advance in human history --
tools fashioned to function
as what Darwinians call "fitness signals" --
that is to say, displays
that are performances
like the peacock's tail,
except that, unlike hair and feathers,
the hand axes are consciously
cleverly crafted.
Competently made hand axes
indicated desirable personal qualities --
intelligence, fine motor control,
planning ability,
conscientiousness
and sometimes access to rare materials.
Over tens of thousands of generations,
such skills increased the status
of those who displayed them
and gained a reproductive advantage
over the less capable.
You know, it's an old line,
but it has been shown to work --
"Why don't you come up to my cave, so I can show you my hand axes?"
is that we can't be sure how that idea was conveyed,
because the Homo erectus
that made these objects
did not have language.
It's hard to grasp,
but it's an incredible fact.
This object was made
by a hominid ancestor,
Homo erectus or Homo ergaster,
between 50,000 and 100,000 years
before language.
Stretching over a million years,
the hand axe tradition
is the longest artistic tradition
in human and proto-human history.
By the end of the hand axe epic, Homo sapiens --
as they were then called, finally --
were doubtless finding new ways
to amuse and amaze each other
by, who knows, telling jokes,
storytelling, dancing, or hairstyling.
Yes, hairstyling -- I insist on that.
virtuoso technique
is used to create imaginary worlds
in fiction and in movies,
to express intense emotions
with music, painting and dance.
But still,
one fundamental trait
of the ancestral personality persists
in our aesthetic cravings:
the beauty we find
in skilled performances.
From Lascaux to the Louvre
to Carnegie Hall,
human beings
have a permanent innate taste
for virtuoso displays in the arts.
We find beauty
in something done well.
displaying a beautifully cut
teardrop-shaped stone,
don't be so sure
it's just your culture telling you
that that sparkling jewel is beautiful.
Your distant ancestors loved that shape
and found beauty in the skill needed to make it,
even before
they could put their love into words.
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder?
No, it's deep in our minds.
It's a gift handed down from the intelligent skills
and rich emotional lives
of our most ancient ancestors.
Our powerful reaction to images,
to the expression of emotion in art,
to the beauty of music, to the night sky,
will be with us and our descendants
for as long as the human race exists.
which is a problem we all kind of have.
But let's sort of start at the beginning.
And so what they typically do is they decide
So a company, or a charity, or an organization of any kind,
most people have to go to an office every day.
they build offices.
They go out and they buy a building, or they rent a building,
or they lease some space,
and they fill this space with stuff.
They fill it with tables, or desks,
maybe a fridge, maybe a few other things,
where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done?
I've been asking people this question for about 10 years:
a plane, a car -- so, the commute.
"Well, it doesn't really matter where I am,
People go to work,
and you look back on the day,
I used the software they told me to use.
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to.
I just did tasks.
I didn't actually get meaningful work done."
You might have a quick idea,
Six? Five? Four?
When's the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office?
long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office.
because there are no distractions.
or stage-based, events.
you don't just pick up where you left off.
you have to start again.
So you have to go back a few phases and start again.
and you're like, "I didn't sleep very well.
but I didn't really sleep."
People say you go "to" sleep,
and if you're interrupted, you don't sleep well.
I don't think anyone would say yes.
Why do we expect people to work well
or you've got your own couch, or whatever you want to do.
"If I can't see the person, how do I know they're working?"
They'll watch TV, or do this other thing."
It turns out those aren't the things that are distracting,
Because those are voluntary distractions.
or when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk.
So let's go through a couple of those.
the Managers and the Meetings.
it's because of the M&Ms.
Now what's interesting is,
That's pretty much what managers are for. They're for interrupting people.
which is call meetings.
And meetings are just toxic,
terrible, poisonous things
during the day at work.
The manager calls the meeting
so the employees can all come together,
you've got to stop doing it, so you can have this meeting."
So they go into a meeting room, they get together,
and they talk about stuff that doesn't really matter, usually.
Because meetings aren't work.
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour.
And so we tend to fill these times up
when things should go really quickly.
These things don't exist outside of the office.
What can managers do --
enlightened managers, hopefully --
what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work,
so it's not the last resort, but it's the first resort,
so that people start to say,
And what you'll find
is that a tremendous amount of work gets done
when no one talks to each other.
This is when people actually get stuff done,
better than a new monitor, better than new software,
or whatever people typically use.
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office
So maybe it's every other week,
or every week, once a week,
afternoons no one can talk to each other.
That's something that you'll find will really, really work.
or collaboration products, things like that.
you can't hide your manager.
You can put these things away,
and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule, at your own time,
So you'll be going up, doing some work,
and then you'll come down from that work,
that need to happen, that need to be answered right this second.
and other things that someone can put away
I don't mean move it;
I mean just erase it from memory, it's gone.
And you'll find out that everything will be just fine.
to think about laying off a little bit,
and giving people more time to get work done.
I think it'll all pay off in the end.
So, a funny thing happened

The first: study up.

It died, in large part,
but I am going to tell you that, if it matters to you,
your legislators need to know that.
Ask about what kind of protective equipment is available.
As it turns out, it occurred to Tom that a $20 helmet

here's my baby, Vander,
reminding you
to mind your matter.
Today I'm going to take you on a voyage
to some place so deep,
so dark, so unexplored
that we know less about it than we know about the dark side of the moon.
It's a place of myth and legend.
It's a place marked on ancient maps
as "here be monsters."
It is a place where each new voyage of exploration
brings back new discoveries of creatures so wondrous and strange
that our forefathers would have considered them monstrous indeed.
Instead, they just make me green with envy
that my colleague from IUCN
was able to go on this journey to the south of Madagascar seamounts
to actually take photographs
and to see these wondrous creatures of the deep.
The "high seas" is a legal term,
but in fact, it covers 50 percent of the planet.
With an average depth of the oceans
of 4,000 meters,
in fact, the high seas covers and provides
nearly 90 percent of the habitat
But in reality,
it is managed by and for
those who have the resources
So today I'm going to take you on a voyage
to cast light on some of the outdated myths
and legends and assumptions
And then finally, we're going to try
to develop and pioneer a new perspective
on high seas governance
that's rooted in ocean-basin-wide conservation,
but framed in an arena of global norms
as seen from above --
that area in the darker blue.
To me, as an international lawyer,
this scared me far more
than any of the creatures or the monsters we may have seen,
that provides us all with carbon storage,
with heat storage, with oxygen,
if you can only protect 36 percent.
This is indeed the true heart of the planet.
provide more protection
to the areas closest to shore.
For example, garbage discharge,
something you would think just simply goes away,
but the laws regulating
ship discharge of garbage
actually get weaker the further you are from shore.
As a result, we have garbage patches
the size of twice-Texas.
We used to think the solution to pollution
was dilution,
but that has proved to be no longer the case.
and economists like Elinor Ostrom,
who are studying the phenomenon
of management of the commons on a local scale,
is that there are certain prerequisites
that you can put into place
that enable you to manage
and access open space

And these include a sense of shared responsibility,
common norms that bind people together as a community.

is that it is not all doom and gloom
that we are seeing in the high seas.
For a group of very dedicated individuals --
scientists, conservationists,
photographers and states --
were able to actually change a tragic trajectory
that was destroying fragile seascapes
such as this coral garden
that you see in front of you.
That is, we're able to save it from a fate
of deep-sea bottom trawling.
Well, as I said, we had a group of photographers that went out on board ships
and actually photographed the activities in process.
in the basements of the United Nations,
trying to work with governments to make them understand
what was going on so far away from land
from 2003 to 2006,
we were able to get norm in place
that actually changed the paradigm
of how fishers went about
deep-sea bottom trawling.
Instead of "go anywhere, do anything you want,"
we actually created a regime
that required prior assessment of where you're going
and a duty to prevent significant harm.
In 2009, when the U.N. reviewed progress,
had been protected.
This does not mean that it's the final solution,
is that a group of individuals can form a community
to actually shape
the way high seas are governed,
to create a new regime.
So I'm looking optimistically at our opportunities
for creating a true, blue perspective
for this beautiful planet.
Sylvia's wish
provides us with that leverage, that access
who have rarely seen places beyond their own toes,
but are now hopefully going to become interested
in the full life-cycle of creatures like these sea turtles,
who indeed spend most of their time in the high seas.
of some of these special areas,
just to give you an idea of the flavor
of the riches and wonders they do contain.
The Sargasso Sea, for example,
is not a sea bounded by coastlines,
but it is bounded by oceanic currents
that contain and envelope
this wealth of sargassum
that grows and aggregates there.
and Northern American rivers
that are now so dwindling in numbers
the same way it aggregates sargassum weed,
actually is pulling in the plastic
from throughout the region.
This picture doesn't exactly show
pieces of plastic per square-kilometer
now floating in the surface of the Sargasso Sea,
and that is affecting the habitat
for the many species in their juvenile stages
who come to the Sargasso Sea
for its protection and its food.
for the aggregation of these unique species
that have developed to mimic the sargassum habitat.
But what I'd like to get from this picture
is that we truly do have an opportunity
to launch a global initiative for protection.
and its responsibility
as having some of the Sargasso Sea
within its national jurisdiction --
but the vast majority is beyond --
to help spearhead a movement
to achieve protection for this vital area.
the Ross Sea in the Southern Ocean.
It's actually a bay.
It's considered high seas, because the continent
has been put off limits
to territorial claims.
So anything in the water is treated as if it's the high seas.
But what makes the Ross Sea important
is the vast sea of pack ice
that in the spring and summer
provides a wealth of phytoplankton and krill
that supports what, till recently,
has been a virtually intact
near-shore ecosystem.
But unfortunately, CCAMLR,
the regional commission
in charge of conserving and managing fish stocks
and other living marine resources,
is unfortunately starting to give in to fishing interests
and has authorized the expansion
of toothfish fisheries in the region.
The captain of a New Zealand vessel
who was just down there
is reporting a significant decline
in the number of the Ross Sea killer whales,
who are directly dependent on the Antarctic toothfish
as their main source of food.
So what we need to do is to stand up boldly,
singly and together,
to push governments,
to push regional fisheries management organizations,
to declare our right
to declare certain areas off-limits to high seas fishing,
so that the freedom to fish no longer means
the freedom to fish anywhere and anytime.
is a recently discovered area --
potentially year-round habitat for blue whales.
There's enough food there to last them
the summer and the winter long.
But what's unusual about the Costa Rica Dome
is, in fact, it's not a permanent place.
It's an oceanographic phenomenon
that shifts in time and space on a seasonal basis.
So, in fact, it's not permanently in the high seas.
It's not permanently in the exclusive economic zones
of these five Central American countries,
but it moves with the season.
As such, it does create a challenge to protect,
but we also have a challenge protecting the species that move along with it.
We can use the same technologies that fishers use
to identify where the species are,
in order to close the area
when it's most vulnerable,
which may, in some cases, be year-round.
this was in fact taken in the Galapagos.
Many species are headed through this region,
which is why there's been so much attention
put into conservation
of the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
This is the initiative that's been coordinated
by Conservation International
with a variety of partners and governments
That is, it provides a wonderful example of where you can go
with a real regional initiative.
It's protecting five World Heritage sites.
Unfortunately, the World Heritage Convention
does not recognize the need to protect areas
beyond national jurisdiction, at present.
So a place like the Costa Rica Dome
could not technically qualify
the time it's in the high seas.
So what we've been suggesting
is that we either need to amend the World Heritage Convention,
so that it can adopt
and urge universal protection of these World Heritage sites,
or we need to change the name
and call it Half-the-World Heritage Convention.
But what we also know is that species like these sea turtles
do not stay put in the Eastern Tropical Pacific Seascape.
These happen to go down to a vast South Pacific Gyre,
where they spend most of their time
and often end up getting hooked like this,
or as bycatch.
We need to work locally,
but we also need to work ocean-basin-wide.
We have the tools and technologies now
to enable us to take a broader
ocean-basin-wide initiative.
We've heard about the Tagging of Pacific Predators project,
one of the 17 Census of Marine Life projects.
It's provided us data like this,
of tiny, little sooty shearwaters
that make the entire ocean basin their home.
They fly 65,000 kilometers
in less than a year.
So we have the tools and treasures coming from the Census of Marine Life.
And its culminating year
that's going to be launched in October.
So stay tuned for further information.
What I find so exciting
is that the Census of Marine Life
has looked at more than the tagging of pacific predators;
it's also looked in the really unexplored mid-water column,
where creatures like this flying sea cucumber
have been found.
to team up with the Census of Marine Life
We've been revealing this information through technical workshops.
And the exciting thing is that we do have sufficient information
to move ahead to protect some of these
significant hope spots, hotspots.
At the same time we're saying,
if you get these marine protected areas,
or a reasonable regime for high seas fisheries management in place,
how are you going to enforce it?
Which leads me to my second passion besides ocean science,
so I've constantly followed
what are the tools available to monitor Earth
from outer space --
and that we have incredible tools like we've been learning about,
in terms of being able to follow tagged species
throughout their life-cycles
in the open ocean.
We can also tag and track fishing vessels.
Many already have transponders on board
that allow us to find out where they are and even what they're doing.
But not all the vessels have those to date.
It does not take too much rocket science
to actually try to create new laws to mandate,
if you're going to have the privilege
of accessing our high seas resources,
we need to know -- someone needs to know --
which is we can avert a tragedy of the commons.
We can stop the collision course
of 50 percent of the planet
with the high seas.
But we need to think broad-scale. We need to think globally.
We need to change how we actually go about
managing these resources.
We need to get the new paradigm
of precaution and respect.
At the same time, we need to think locally,
which is the joy and marvel of Sylvia's hope spot wish,
is that we can shine a spotlight
on many of these previously unknown areas,
and to bring people to the table, if you will,
to actually make them feel part of this community
that truly has a stake
in their future management.
And third is that we need to look at ocean-basin-wide management.
Our species are ocean-basin-wide.
Many of the deep-sea communities
have genetic distribution
that goes ocean-basin-wide.
We need to better understand,
but we also need to start to manage and protect.
And in order to do that,
you also need ocean-basin management regimes.
That is, we have regional management regimes
within the exclusive economic zone,
but we need to scale these up, we need to build their capacity,
so they're like the Southern Ocean,
where they do have the two-pronged fisheries
Sylvia Earle for her wish,
for it is helping us to put a face on the high seas
and the deep seas beyond national jurisdiction.
It's helping to bring an incredible group
of talented people together
to really try to solve and penetrate
these problems that have created our obstacles
to management and rational use
of this area that was once so far away and remote.
with a new perspective of the high seas:
one, that it is our home too,
and that we need to work together
I grew up
in a very small village in Canada,
and I'm an undiagnosed
dyslexic.
I had a really hard time in school.
In fact, my mother told me eventually
that I was the little kid in the village
who cried all the way to school.
I ran away.
I left when I was 25 years old to go to Bali,
and there I met my incredible wife, Cynthia,
and together, over 20 years,
we built an amazing jewelry business.
It was a fairy tale, and then we retired.
Then she took me to see a film
that I really didn't want to see.
It ruined my life --
(Laughter)
"The Inconvenient Truth" and Mr. Gore.
I have four kids,
and even if part of what he says is true,
they're not going to have the life that I had.
And I decided at that moment
that I would spend the rest of my life
doing whatever I could
to improve their possibilities.
So here's the world,
and here we are in Bali.
It's a tiny, little island --
60 miles by 90 miles.
It has an intact Hindu culture.
Cynthia and I were there.
We had had a wonderful life there,
and we decided to do something unusual.
We decided to give back
locally.
I know it doesn't look like a school,
but it is something we decided to do,
and it is extremely,
extremely green.
The classrooms have no walls.
The teacher is writing on a bamboo blackboard.
The desks are not square.
At Green School, the children are smiling --
an unusual thing for school, especially for me.
And we practice holism.
And for me it's just the idea
that, if this little girl
graduates as a whole person,
chances are
she'll demand a whole world --
a whole world --
to live on.
Our children spend 181 days
going to school in a box.
The people that built my school
also built the prison and the insane asylum
out of the same materials.
So if this gentleman
had had a holistic education,
would he be sitting there?
Would he have had more possibilities in his life?
They're beautiful. They're bamboo.
The breeze passes through them.
And when the natural breeze isn't enough,
the kids deploy bubbles,
but not the kind of bubbles you know.
These bubbles are made from natural cotton
and rubber from the rubber tree.
So we basically turned the box
into a bubble.
And these kids know
that painless climate control
may not be
part of their future.
We pay the bill at the end of the month,
but the people that are really going to pay the bill
are our grandchildren.
We have to teach the kids
that the world is not indestructible.
These kids did a little graffiti on their desks,
and then they signed up for two extra courses.
The first one was called sanding
and the second one was called re-waxing.
But since that happened,
they own those desks.
They know they can control their world.
But an amazing alternative energy company in Paris
is taking us off the grid with solar.
And this thing
is the second vortex to be built in the world,
in a two-and-a-half meter drop on a river.
When the turbine drops in,
it will produce 8,000 watts of electricity,
day and night.
And you know what these are.
There's nowhere to flush.
And as long as we're taking our waste
and mixing it with a huge amount of water --
you're all really smart, just do the math.
How many people times how much water.
There isn't enough water.
These are compost toilets,
and nobody at the school wanted to know about them,
especially the principal.
And they work. People use them. People are okay.
It's something you should think about doing.
Not many things didn't work.
The beautiful canvas and rubber skylights
got eaten by the sun in six months.
We had to replace them with recyclable plastic.
The teachers dragged giant PVC whiteboards
into the classrooms.
So we had some good ideas:
we took old automobile windshields, put paper behind them
and created the first alternative
to the whiteboard.
and it's on 20 acres
of rolling garden.
There's an amazing river traveling through it,
and you can see there
how we manage to get across the river.
I met a father the other day; he looked a little crazed.
I said, "Welcome to Green School."
He said, "I've been on an airplane for 24 hours."
I asked him, "Why?"
He said, "I had a dream once about a green school,
and I saw a picture of this green school,
I got on an airplane.
In August I'm bringing my sons."
This was a great thing.
But more than that,
people are building green houses around Green School,
so their kids can walk to school on the paths.
And people are bringing their green industries,
hopefully their green restaurants,
to the Green School.
It's becoming a community.
It's becoming a green model.
We had to look at everything.
No petrochemicals in the pavement.
No pavement.
These are volcanic stones laid by hand.
There are no sidewalks.
The sidewalks are gravel. They flood when it rains,
but they're green.
He's planning to eat that fence for dinner.
All the fences at Green School are green.
And when the kindergarten kids
recently moved their gate,
they found out the fence was made out of tapioca.
They took the tapioca roots up to the kitchen,
sliced them thinly and made delicious chips.
Landscaping.
We manage to keep the garden that was there
running right up to the edge of each of the classrooms.
We dropped them gently in.
We made space for these guys
who are Bali's last black pigs.
And the school cow
is trying to figure out
how to replace the lawnmower
on the playing field.
are living in a rice culture,
but they know something that few people know in a rice culture.
They know how to plant organic rice,
they know how to look after it,
they know how to harvest and they know how to cook it.
They're part of the rice cycle
and these skills will be valuable
for them in their future.
This young man is picking organic vegetables.
We feed 400 people lunch every day
and it's not a normal lunch. There's no gas.
Local Balinese women
cook the food on sawdust burners
using secrets that only their grandmothers know.
The food is incredible.
local and global.
And it's a kind of microcosm
of the globalized world.
The kids are from 25 countries.
When I see them together,
I know that they're working out
how to live in the future.
Green School is going into its third year
with 160 children.
It's a school where you do learn reading --
one of my favorites --
writing -- I was bad at it --
arithmetic.
But you also learn other things.
You learn bamboo building.
You practice
ancient Balinese arts.
This is called mud wrestling in the rice fields.
The kids love it.
The mothers aren't quite convinced.
and we said, okay, local, what does "local" mean?
Local means
that 20 percent of the population of the school
has to be Balinese,
and this was a really big commitment.
And we were right.
And people are coming forward
from all over the world
to support the Balinese Scholarship Fund,
because these kids will be Bali's next green leaders.
The teachers are as diverse
as the student body,
and the amazing thing
is that volunteers are popping up.
A man came from Java
with a new kind of organic agriculture.
A woman came from Africa with music.
And together these volunteers and the teachers
are deeply committed
to creating a new generation
of global, green leaders.
The Green School effect --
we don't know what it is.
We need someone to come and study it.
But what's happening, our learning-different kids --
dyslexic --
we've renamed them prolexic --
are doing well in these beautiful, beautiful classrooms.
And all the kids are thriving.
On giant grass.
It's bamboo.
It comes out of the ground like a train.
It grows as high as a coconut tree in two months
and three years later it can be harvested
to build buildings like this.
It's as strong and dense as teak
and it will hold up any roof.
When the architects came, they brought us these things,
and you've probably seen things like this.
The yellow box was called the administration complex.
(Laughter)
We squashed it, we rethought it,
but mainly we renamed it
"the heart of school,"
and that changed everything forever.
It's a double helix.
It has administrators in it
and many, many other things.
when the Balinese workers
saw long reams of plans,
they looked at them and said, "What's this?"
So we built big models.
We had them engineered by the engineers.
And Balinese carpenters like this
measured them with their bamboo rulers,
selected the bamboo and built the buildings
using age-old techniques,
mostly by hand.
It was chaos.
And the Balinese carpenters want to be as modern as we do,
so they use metal scaffolding
to build the bamboo building
and when the scaffolding came down,
we realized that we had a cathedral,
a cathedral to green,
and a cathedral to green education.
The heart of school has seven kilometers
of bamboo in it.
From the time the foundations were finished,
in three months it had roofs and floors.
It may not be the biggest bamboo building in the world,
but many people believe
that it's the most beautiful.
We believe it is.
Green School is a model we built for the world.
It's a model we built for Bali.
And you just have to follow these simple, simple rules:
be local,
let the environment lead
and think about
how your grandchildren might build.
You ruined my life,
but you gave me an incredible future.
And if you're interested in being involved
in finishing Green School
and building the next 50 around the world,
please come and see us.
Mountain biking in Israel
is something that I do with great passion
and commitment.
And when I'm on my bike,
I feel that I connect
with the profound beauty of Israel,
and I feel that I'm united
with this country's history
and biblical law.
And also, for me,
biking is a matter of empowerment.
When I reach the summit
of a steep mountain in the middle of nowhere,
I feel young,
invincible, eternal.
It's as if I'm connecting with some legacy
or with some energy
far greater than myself.
You can see my fellow riders
at the end of the picture,
looking at me with some concern.
And here is another picture of them.
Unfortunately, I cannot show their faces,
neither can I disclose their true names,
and that's because my fellow riders
are juvenile inmates,
offenders
spending time in a correction facility
about 20 minutes' ride from here --
well, like everything in Israel.
And I've been riding with these kids once a week,
every Tuesday, rain or shine, for the last four years
and by now, they've become a very big part of my life.
The correction facility where they are locked up
happens to be right in the middle
of one of my usual trips,
and it's surrounded by barbed wires
and electric gates and armed guards.
So on one of these rides,
I talked my way into the compound
and went to see the warden.
I told the warden
that I wanted to start a mountain biking club in this place
and that basically I wanted to take the kids
from here to there.
And I told him, "Let's find a way
in which I'll be able to take out 10 kids once a week
to ride with in the summer in the country."
And the warden was quite amused,
and he told me he thought that I was a nut
and he told me,
"This place is a correction facility. These guys are serious offenders.
They are supposed to be locked up.
And yet, we began to talk about it,
and one thing led to another.
And I can't see myself
going into a state prison in New Jersey
and making such a proposition,
but this being Israel,
the warden somehow made it happen.
And so two months later,
we found ourselves "at large" --
myself,
10 juvenile inmates
and a wonderful fellow named Russ,
who became a very good friend of mine
and my partner in this project.
of introducing these kids
to the world of total freedom,
a world consisting of magnificent vistas
like these --
everything you see here is obviously in Israel --
as well as close encounters
with all sorts of small creatures
coming in all sorts of sizes,
colors, shapes, forms
and so on.
In spite of all this splendor,
the beginning was extremely frustrating.
Every small obstacle,
every slight uphill,
would cause these fellows
to stop in their tracks and give up.
So we had a lot of this going on.
I found out that they had a very hard time
dealing with frustration and difficulties --
not because they were physically unfit.
But that's one reason why they ended up where they were.
And I became increasingly more and more agitated,
because I was there
not only to be with them,
but also to ride and create a team
and I didn't know what to do.
We're going downhill in some rocky terrain,
and the front tire of Alex
gets caught in one of these crevasses here.
So he crashes down,
and he gets slightly injured,
but this does not prevent him from jumping up
and then starting to jump up and down on his bike
and curse violently.
Then he throws his helmet in the air.
His backpack goes ballistic in some other direction.
And then he runs to the nearest tree
and starts to break branches and throw rocks
and curse like I've never heard.
And I'm just standing there,
watching this scene
with a complete disbelief,
not knowing what to do.
I'm used to algorithms
and data structures
and super motivated students,
and nothing in my background
prepared me to deal
with a raging, violent adolescent
in the middle of nowhere.
And you have to realize that these incidents
did not happen in convenient locations.
They happened in places like this,
in the Judean Desert,
20 kilometers away from the nearest road.
And what you don't see in this picture
is that somewhere between these riders there,
there's a teenager sitting on a rock,
saying, "I'm not moving from here. Forget it.
I've had it."
Well, that's a problem
because one way or another, you have to get this guy moving
because it's getting dark soon and dangerous.
At the beginning, it was a disaster.
I tried harsh words and threats
and they took me nowhere.
That's what they had all their lives.
And at some point I found out,
when a kid like this gets into a fit,
the best thing that you can possibly do
is stay as close as possible to this kid,
which is difficult,
because what you really want to do is go away.
But that's what he had all his life,
people walking away from him.
So what you have to do is stay close
and try to reach in
and pet his shoulder
or give him a piece of chocolate.
So I would say, "Alex, I know that it's terribly difficult.
Why don't you rest for a few minutes
and then we'll go on."
"Go away you maniac-psychopath.
Why would you bring us to this goddamn place?"
And I would say, "Relax, Alex.
Here's a piece of chocolate."
And Alex would go, "Arrrrggg!"
Because you have to understand
that on these rides we are constantly hungry --
and after the rides also.
He's a 17-year-old.
When he was eight,
someone put him on a boat in Odessa
and sent him, shipped him to Israel
on his own.
And he ended up in south Tel Aviv
and did not have the good luck
to be picked up by a [unclear]
And he spent the last 10 years of his life
in two places only,
before he ended up sitting on this rock there.
And so this kid
was probably abused,
abandoned, ignored, betrayed
by almost every adult along the way.
So, for such a kid,
when an adult that he learns to respect stays close to him
and doesn't walk away from him
in any situation,
irrespective of how he behaves,
it's a tremendous healing experience.
It's an act of unconditional acceptance,
something that he never had.
When I started this program four years ago,
I had this original plan
of creating a team
of winning underdogs.
I had an image of Lance Armstrong
in my mind.
And it took me exactly two months
of complete frustration
to realize that this vision
was misplaced,
and that there was another vision
supremely more important
and more readily available.
It all of a sudden dawned on me, in this project,
that the purpose of these rides
should actually be
to expose the kids
to one thing only: love.
Love to the country, to the uphill
and the downhill,
to all the incredible creatures that surround us --
the animals, the plants,
the insects --
love and respect
to other fellow members in your team,
in your biking team,
and most importantly,
love and respect to yourself,
which is something
that they badly miss.
I also went through a remarkable transformation.
Now, I come from a cutthroat world
of science and high technology.
I used to think that reason and logic
and relentless drive
were the only ways to make things happen.
And before I worked with the kids,
anything that I did with them,
or anything that I did with myself,
was supposed to be perfect,
ideal, optimal,
but after working with them for some time,
I discovered the great virtues of empathy
and flexibility
and being able to start with some vision,
and if the vision doesn't work, well nothing happened.
All you have to do is play with it, change it a little bit,
and come up with something that does help, that does work.
So right now, I feel more
like these are my principles,
and if you don't like them,
I have others.
is focus.
Before each ride
we sit together with the kids,
and we give them one word
to think about during the ride.
You have to focus their attention on something
because so many things happen.
So these are words like "teamwork"
or "endurance"
or even complicated concepts
like "resource allocation"
or "perspective," a word that they don't understand.
You know, perspective
is one of these critically important
life-coping strategies
that mountain biking can really teach you.
I tell kids
when they struggle through some uphill
and feel like they cannot take it anymore,
it really helps to ignore the immediate obstacles
and raise your head and look around
and see how the vista around you grows.
It literally propels you upwards.
That's what perspective is all about.
Or you can also look back in time
and realize that you've already conquered
steeper mountains before.
And that's how they develop self-esteem.
You stand with your bike at the beginning of February.
It's very cold, and you're standing in one of these rainy days,
and it's drizzling
and cold and chilly,
and you're standing in, let's say, Yokneam.
And you look up at the sky through a hole in the clouds
you see the monastery at the top of the Muhraka --
that's where you're supposed to climb now --
and you say, "There's no way that I could possibly get there."
And yet, two hours later
you find yourself standing on the roof of this monastery,
smeared with mud,
blood and sweat.
And you look down at Yokneam;
everything is so small and tiny.
And you say, "Hey, Alex. Look at this parking lot where we started.
It's that big.
I can't believe that I did it."
And that's the point
when you start loving yourself.
these special words that we teach them.
And at the end of each ride, we sit together
and share moments
in which those special words of the day
popped up and made a difference,
and these discussions
can be extremely inspiring.
In one of them, one of the kids once said,
"When we were riding on this ridge
overlooking the Dead Sea --
and he's talking about this spot here --
"I was reminded
of the day when I left my village in Ethiopia
and went away together with my brother.
We walked 120 kilometers
until we reached Sudan.
This was the first place where we got some water and supplies."
And he goes on saying, and everyone looks at him like a hero,
probably for the first time in his life.
And he says -- because I also have volunteers riding with me,
adults, who are sitting there
listening to him --
and he says, "And this was just the beginning
of our ordeal
until we ended up in Israel.
And only now," he says,
"I'm beginning to understand where I am,
and I actually like it."
Now I remember, when he said it,
That's where Joshua descended
and crossed the Jordan
and led the people of Israel into the land of Canaan
3,000 years ago
in this final leg
of the journey from Africa.
and context and history
play key roles
in the way I plan my rides
with the kids.
We visit Kibbutzim
that were established by Holocaust survivors.
We explore ruins
of Palestinian villages,
and we discuss how they became ruins.
And we go through numerous remnants
of Jewish settlements, Nabatic settlements,
Canaanite settlements --
three-, four, five-thousand years old.
And through this tapestry,
which is the history of this country,
the kids acquire
what is probably the most important
value in education,
and that is the understanding that life is complex,
and there's no black and white.
And by appreciating complexity,
they become more tolerant,
and tolerance leads to hope.
every Tuesday.
Here's a picture I took last Tuesday -- less than a week ago --
and I ride with them tomorrow also.
In every one of these rides
I always end up standing in one of these incredible locations,
taking in this incredible landscape around me,
and I feel blessed and fortunate
that I'm alive,
and that I sense every fiber
in my aching body.
And I feel blessed and fortunate
that 15 years ago
I had the courage to resign
my tenured position at NYU
and return to my home country
where I can do these incredible rides
with this group of troubled kids
coming from Ethiopia
and Morocco and Russia.
And I feel blessed and fortunate
that every week, every Tuesday --
and actually every Friday also --
I can once again celebrate
in the marrow of my bones
the very essence of living in Israel on the edge.
We've got a real problem with math education right now.
Basically, no one's very happy.
Those learning it
think it's disconnected,
uninteresting and hard.
Those trying to employ them
think they don't know enough.
Governments realize that it's a big deal for our economies,
but don't know how to fix it.
And teachers are also frustrated.
Yet math is more important to the world
than at any point in human history.
So at one end we've got falling interest
in education in math,
and at the other end we've got a more mathematical world,
a more quantitative world than we ever have had.
and what can we do to fix it?
Well actually, I think the answer
is staring us right in the face:
Use computers.
I believe
that correctly using computers
is the silver bullet
for making math education work.
So to explain that,
let me first talk a bit about what math looks like in the real world
and what it looks like in education.
See, in the real world
math isn't necessarily done by mathematicians.
It's done by geologists,
engineers, biologists,
all sorts of different people --
modeling and simulation.
It's actually very popular.
But in education it looks very different --
dumbed-down problems, lots of calculating,
mostly by hand.
Lots of things that seem simple
and not difficult like in the real world,
except if you're learning it.
And another thing about math:
math sometimes looks like math --
like in this example here --
and sometimes it doesn't --
like "Am I drunk?"
And then you get an answer that's quantitative in the modern world.
You wouldn't have expected that a few years back.
But now you can find out all about --
unfortunately, my weight is a little higher than that, but --
all about what happens.
why are we teaching people math?
What's the point of teaching people math?
And in particular, why are we teaching them math in general?
Why is it such an important part of education
as a sort of compulsory subject?
Well, I think there are about three reasons:
technical jobs
so critical to the development of our economies,
what I call "everyday living" --
to function in the world today,
you've got to be pretty quantitative,
much more so than a few years ago:
figure out your mortgages,
being skeptical of government statistics, those kinds of things --
and thirdly, what I would call something like
logical mind training, logical thinking.
Over the years
we've put so much in society
into being able to process and think logically. It's part of human society.
It's very important to learn that
math is a great way to do that.
What is math?
What do we mean when we say we're doing math,
or educating people to do math?
Well, I think it's about four steps, roughly speaking,
starting with posing the right question.
What is it that we want to ask? What is it we're trying to find out here?
And this is the thing most screwed up in the outside world,
beyond virtually any other part of doing math.
People ask the wrong question,
and surprisingly enough, they get the wrong answer,
for that reason, if not for others.
So the next thing is take that problem
and turn it from a real world problem
into a math problem.
That's stage two.
Once you've done that, then there's the computation step.
Turn it from that into some answer
in a mathematical form.
And of course, math is very powerful at doing that.
And then finally, turn it back to the real world.
Did it answer the question?
And also verify it -- crucial step.
Now here's the crazy thing right now.
In math education,
we're spending about perhaps 80 percent of the time
teaching people to do step three by hand.
Yet, that's the one step computers can do
better than any human after years of practice.
Instead, we ought to be using computers
to do step three
and using the students to spend much more effort
on learning how to do steps one, two and four --
conceptualizing problems, applying them,
getting the teacher to run them through how to do that.
math is not equal to calculating.
Math is a much broader subject than calculating.
Now it's understandable that this has all got intertwined
over hundreds of years.
There was only one way to do calculating and that was by hand.
But in the last few decades
that has totally changed.
We've had the biggest transformation of any ancient subject
that I could ever imagine with computers.
Calculating was typically the limiting step,
and now often it isn't.
So I think in terms of the fact that math
has been liberated from calculating.
But that math liberation didn't get into education yet.
See, I think of calculating, in a sense,
as the machinery of math.
It's the chore.
It's the thing you'd like to avoid if you can, like to get a machine to do.
It's a means to an end, not an end in itself,
and automation allows us
to have that machinery.
Computers allow us to do that --
and this is not a small problem by any means.
I estimated that, just today, across the world,
we spent about 106 average world lifetimes
teaching people how to calculate by hand.
That's an amazing amount of human endeavor.
So we better be damn sure --
and by the way, they didn't even have fun doing it, most of them --
so we better be damn sure
that we know why we're doing that
and it has a real purpose.
for doing the calculating
and only doing hand calculations where it really makes sense to teach people that.
And I think there are some cases.
For example: mental arithmetic.
I still do a lot of that, mainly for estimating.
People say, "Is such and such true?"
And I'll say, "Hmm, not sure." I'll think about it roughly.
It's still quicker to do that and more practical.
So I think practicality is one case
where it's worth teaching people by hand.
And then there are certain conceptual things
that can also benefit from hand calculating,
but I think they're relatively small in number.
One thing I often ask about
is ancient Greek and how this relates.
See, the thing we're doing right now
is we're forcing people to learn mathematics.
It's a major subject.
I'm not for one minute suggesting that, if people are interested in hand calculating
or in following their own interests
in any subject however bizarre --
they should do that.
That's absolutely the right thing,
for people to follow their self-interest.
I was somewhat interested in ancient Greek,
but I don't think that we should force the entire population
to learn a subject like ancient Greek.
I don't think it's warranted.
So I have this distinction between what we're making people do
and the subject that's sort of mainstream
and the subject that, in a sense, people might follow with their own interest
and perhaps even be spiked into doing that.
Well one of them is, they say, you need to get the basics first.
You shouldn't use the machine
until you get the basics of the subject.
So my usual question is, what do you mean by "basics?"
Basics of what?
Are the basics of driving a car
learning how to service it, or design it for that matter?
Are the basics of writing learning how to sharpen a quill?
I don't think so.
I think you need to separate the basics of what you're trying to do
from how it gets done
and the machinery of how it gets done
and automation allows you to make that separation.
A hundred years ago, it's certainly true that to drive a car
you kind of needed to know a lot about the mechanics of the car
and how the ignition timing worked and all sorts of things.
But automation in cars
allowed that to separate,
so driving is now a quite separate subject, so to speak,
from engineering of the car
or learning how to service it.
So automation allows this separation
and also allows -- in the case of driving,
and I believe also in the future case of maths --
a democratized way of doing that.
It can be spread across a much larger number of people
who can really work with that.
People confuse, in my view,
the order of the invention of the tools
with the order in which they should use them for teaching.
So just because paper was invented before computers,
it doesn't necessarily mean you get more to the basics of the subject
by using paper instead of a computer
to teach mathematics.
My daughter gave me a rather nice anecdote on this.
She enjoys making what she calls "paper laptops."
(Laughter)
So I asked her one day, "You know, when I was your age,
I didn't make these.
Why do you think that was?"
And after a second or two, carefully reflecting,
she said, "No paper?"
(Laughter)
If you were born after computers and paper,
it doesn't really matter which order you're taught with them in,
you just want to have the best tool.
That somehow, if you use a computer,
it's all mindless button-pushing,
but if you do it by hand,
it's all intellectual.
This one kind of annoys me, I must say.
Do we really believe
that the math that most people are doing in school
practically today
is more than applying procedures
to problems they don't really understand, for reasons they don't get?
I don't think so.
And what's worse, what they're learning there isn't even practically useful anymore.
Might have been 50 years ago, but it isn't anymore.
When they're out of education, they do it on a computer.
Just to be clear, I think computers can really help with this problem,
actually make it more conceptual.
Now, of course, like any great tool,
they can be used completely mindlessly,
like turning everything into a multimedia show,
like the example I was shown of solving an equation by hand,
where the computer was the teacher --
show the student how to manipulate and solve it by hand.
This is just nuts.
Why are we using computers to show a student how to solve a problem by hand
that the computer should be doing anyway?
All backwards.
that you can also make problems harder to calculate.
See, normally in school,
you do things like solve quadratic equations.
But you see, when you're using a computer,
you can just substitute.
You can make it a quartic equation. Make it kind of harder, calculating-wise.
Same principles applied --
calculations, harder.
And problems in the real world
look nutty and horrible like this.
They've got hair all over them.
They're not just simple, dumbed-down things that we see in school math.
And think of the outside world.
Do we really believe that engineering and biology
and all of these other things
that have so benefited from computers and maths
have somehow conceptually gotten reduced by using computers?
I don't think so -- quite the opposite.
So the problem we've really got in math education
is not that computers might dumb it down,
but that we have dumbed-down problems right now.
Well, another issue people bring up
is somehow that hand calculating procedures
teach understanding.
So if you go through lots of examples,
you can get the answer,
you can understand how the basics of the system work better.
I think there is one thing that I think very valid here,
which is that I think understanding procedures and processes is important.
But there's a fantastic way to do that in the modern world.
It's called programming.
get written down these days,
and it's also a great way
to engage students much more
and to check they really understand.
If you really want to check you understand math
then write a program to do it.
So programming is the way I think we should be doing that.
So to be clear, what I really am suggesting here
is we have a unique opportunity
to make maths both more practical
and more conceptual, simultaneously.
I can't think of any other subject where that's recently been possible.
It's usually some kind of choice
between the vocational and the intellectual.
But I think we can do both at the same time here.
And we open up so many more possibilities.
You can do so many more problems.
What I really think we gain from this
is students getting intuition and experience
in far greater quantities than they've ever got before.
And experience of harder problems --
being able to play with the math, interact with it,
feel it.
We want people who can feel the math instinctively.
That's what computers allow us to do.
Traditionally it's been by how difficult it is to calculate,
but now we can reorder it
by how difficult it is to understand the concepts,
however hard the calculating.
So calculus has traditionally been taught very late.
Why is this?
Well, it's damn hard doing the calculations, that's the problem.
But actually many of the concepts
are amenable to a much younger age group.
This was an example I built for my daughter.
And very, very simple.
We were talking about what happens
when you increase the number of sides of a polygon
to a very large number.
And of course, it turns into a circle.
And by the way, she was also very insistent
on being able to change the color,
an important feature for this demonstration.
You can see that this is a very early step
into limits and differential calculus
and what happens when you take things to an extreme --
and very small sides and a very large number of sides.
Very simple example.
That's a view of the world
that we don't usually give people for many, many years after this.
And yet, that's a really important practical view of the world.
So one of the roadblocks we have
in moving this agenda forward
is exams.
In the end, if we test everyone by hand in exams,
it's kind of hard to get the curricula changed
to a point where they can use computers
during the semesters.
so it's very important to get computers in exams.
And then we can ask questions, real questions,
questions like, what's the best life insurance policy to get? --
real questions that people have in their everyday lives.
And you see, this isn't some dumbed-down model here.
This is an actual model where we can be asked to optimize what happens.
How many years of protection do I need?
What does that do to the payments
and to the interest rates and so forth?
Now I'm not for one minute suggesting it's the only kind of question
that should be asked in exams,
but I think it's a very important type
that right now just gets completely ignored
and is critical for people's real understanding.
we have to do in computer-based math.
We have got to make sure
that we can move our economies forward,
and also our societies,
based on the idea that people can really feel mathematics.
This isn't some optional extra.
And the country that does this first
will, in my view, leapfrog others
in achieving a new economy even,
an improved economy,
an improved outlook.
In fact, I even talk about us moving
from what we often call now the "knowledge economy"
to what we might call a "computational knowledge economy,"
where high-level math is integral to what everyone does
in the way that knowledge currently is.
We can engage so many more students with this,
and they can have a better time doing it.
And let's understand:
this is not an incremental sort of change.
We're trying to cross the chasm here
between school math and the real-world math.
And you know if you walk across a chasm,
you end up making it worse than if you didn't start at all --
bigger disaster.
No, what I'm suggesting
is that we should leap off,
we should increase our velocity
so it's high,
and we should leap off one side and go the other --
of course, having calculated our differential equation very carefully.
a completely renewed, changed math curriculum
built from the ground up,
based on computers being there,
computers that are now ubiquitous almost.
Calculating machines are everywhere
and will be completely everywhere in a small number of years.
Now I'm not even sure if we should brand the subject as math,
but what I am sure is
it's the mainstream subject of the future.
Let's go for it,
and while we're about it,
let's have a bit of fun,
for us, for the students and for TED here.
Do you ever feel completely overwhelmed
when you're faced with a complex problem?
Well, I hope to change that in less than three minutes.
So, I hope to convince you that complex
doesn't always equal complicated.
So for me, a well-crafted baguette, fresh out of the oven,
is complex,
but a curry onion green olive poppy cheese bread
is complicated.
I'm an ecologist, and I study complexity. I love complexity.
And I study that in the natural world, the interconnectedness of species.
or a map of feeding links between species
that live in Alpine Lakes in the mountains of California.
And this is what happens to that food web
when it's stocked with non-native fish that never lived there before.
All the grayed-out species disappear.
Some are actually on the brink of extinction.
And lakes with fish have more mosquitos, even though they eat them.
These effects were all unanticipated,
and yet we're discovering they're predictable.
about complexity we're learning from studying nature
that maybe are applicable to other problems.
First is the simple power of good visualization tools
to help untangle complexity
and just encourage you to ask questions you didn't think of before.
For example, you could plot the flow of carbon
through corporate supply chains in a corporate ecosystem,
or the interconnections of habitat patches
for endangered species in Yosemite National Park.
The next thing is that if you want to predict
the effect of one species on another,
if you focus only on that link,
and then you black box the rest,
it's actually less predictable
than if you step back, consider the entire system -- all the species, all the links --
and from that place,
hone in on the sphere of influence that matters most.
And we're discovering, with our research,
that's often very local to the node you care about
within one or two degrees.
So the more you step back, embrace complexity,
the better chance you have of finding simple answers,
and it's often different than the simple answer that you started with.
courtesy of the U.S. government.
This is a diagram of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy in Afghanistan.
It was front page of the New York Times a couple months ago.
Instantly ridiculed by the media
for being so crazy complicated.
And the stated goal was to increase popular support
for the Afghan government.
Clearly a complex problem,
but is it complicated?
Well, when I saw this in the front page of the Times,
I thought, "Great. Finally something I can relate to.
I can sink my teeth into this."
a world premiere view of this spaghetti diagram as an ordered network.
The circled node is the one we're trying to influence --
popular support for the government.
And so now we can look one degrees, two degrees,
three degrees away from that node
and eliminate three-quarters of the diagram outside that sphere of influence.
Within that sphere,
most of those nodes are not actionable, like the harshness of the terrain,
and a very small minority are actual military actions.
Most are non-violent and they fall into two broad categories:
active engagement with ethnic rivalries and religious beliefs
and fair, transparent economic development
and provisioning of services.
I don't know about this, but this is what I can decipher from this diagram
in 24 seconds.
I want you to be excited. I want you to be relieved.
Because simple answers may emerge.
We're discovering in nature that simplicity often lies
on the other side of complexity.
So for any problem, the more you can zoom out and embrace complexity,
the better chance you have of zooming in
on the simple details that matter most.
This cell phone
started its trajectory
in an artisanal mine
in the Eastern Congo.
It's mined by armed gangs
using slaves, child slaves,
what the U.N. Security Council
calls "blood minerals,"
then traveled into some components
and ended up in a factory
in Shinjin in China.
That factory -- over a dozen people have committed suicide
already this year.
One man died after working a 36-hour shift.
We all love chocolate.
We buy it for our kids.
Eighty percent of the cocoa comes from Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana
and it's harvested by children.
Cote d'Ivoire, we have a huge problem of child slaves.
Children have been trafficked from other conflict zones
to come and work on the coffee plantations.
Heparin -- a blood thinner,
a pharmaceutical product --
starts out in artisanal workshops
like this in China,
because the active ingredient
comes from pigs' intestines.
Your diamond -- you've all heard, probably seen the movie "Blood Diamond."
This is a mine in Zimbabwe
right now.
Cotton: Uzbekistan is the second biggest
exporter of cotton on Earth.
Every year when it comes to the cotton harvest,
the government shuts down the schools,
puts the kids in buses, buses them to the cotton fields
to spend three weeks harvesting the cotton.
It's forced child labor
on an institutional scale.
And all of those products probably end their lives
in a dump like this one in Manila.
represent governance gaps.
That's the politest description
I have for them.
These are the dark pools
where global supply chains begin --
the global supply chains,
which bring us our favorite brand name products.
Some of these governance gaps
are run by rogue states.
Some of them are not states anymore at all.
They're failed states.
Some of them
are just countries who believe that deregulation or no regulation
is the best way to attract investment,
promote trade.
Either way, they present us
with a huge moral and ethical dilemma.
I know that none of us want to be accessories
after the fact
of a human rights abuse
in a global supply chain.
But right now,
most of the companies involved in these supply chains
don't have any way
of assuring us
that nobody had to mortgage their future,
nobody had to sacrifice their rights
to bring us our favorite
brand name product.
about the state of the global supply chain.
We need a reality check.
We need to recognize just how serious
a deficit of rights we have.
This is an independent republic,
probably a failed state.
It's definitely not a democratic state.
And right now,
that independent republic of the supply chain
is not being governed
in a way that would satisfy us,
that we can engage in ethical trade or ethical consumption.
Now, that's not a new story.
You've seen the documentaries
of sweatshops making garments
all over the world, even in developed countries.
You want to see the classic sweatshop,
meet me at Madison Square Garden,
I'll take you down the street, and I'll show you a Chinese sweatshop.
It's a pharmaceutical product.
You expect that the supply chain that gets it to the hospital,
probably squeaky clean.
The problem is that the active ingredient in there --
as I mentioned earlier --
comes from pigs.
The main American manufacturer
of that active ingredient
decided a few years ago to relocate to China
because it's the world's biggest supplier of pigs.
And their factory in China --
which probably is pretty clean --
is getting all of the ingredients
from backyard abattoirs,
where families slaughter pigs
and extract the ingredient.
So a couple of years ago, we had a scandal
which killed about 80 people around the world,
because of contaminants
that crept into the heparin supply chain.
Worse, some of the suppliers
realized that they could substitute a product
which mimicked heparin in tests.
This substitute cost nine dollars a pound,
whereas real heparin, the real ingredient,
cost 900 dollars a pound.
A no-brainer.
The problem was that it killed more people.
"How come the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
allowed this to happen?
How did the Chinese State Agency for Food and Drugs
allow this to happen?"
And the answer is quite simple:
the Chinese define these facilities
as chemical facilities, not pharmaceutical facilities,
so they don't audit them.
And the USFDA
has a jurisdictional problem.
This is offshore.
They actually do conduct a few investigations overseas --
about a dozen a year -- maybe 20 in a good year.
There are 500
of these facilities
producing active ingredients in China alone.
In fact, about 80 percent
of the active ingredients in medicines now
come from offshore,
particularly China and India,
and we don't have a governance system.
We don't have a regulatory system
able to ensure
that that production is safe.
We don't have a system to ensure
that human rights, basic dignity,
are ensured.
and we work in about 60 different countries --
at a national level
we've got a serious breakdown in the ability of governments
to regulate production
on their own soil.
And the real problem with the global supply chain
is that it's supranational.
So governments who are failing,
who are dropping the ball
at a national level,
have even less ability to get their arms around the problem
at an international level.
And you can just look at the headlines.
Take Copenhagen last year --
complete failure of governments
to do the right thing
in the face of an international challenge.
Take the G20 meeting a couple of weeks ago --
stepped back from its commitments of just a few months ago.
You can take any one
of the major global challenges we've discussed this week
and ask yourself, where is the leadership from governments
to step up and come up with solutions,
responses,
to those international problems?
And the simple answer is they can't. They're national.
Their voters are local.
They have parochial interests.
They can't subordinate those interests
to the greater global public good.
of the key public goods
at an international level --
in this case, in the global supply chain --
we have to come up with a different mechanism.
We need a different machine.
Fortunately, we have some examples.
In the 1990s,
there were a whole series of scandals
concerning the production of brand name goods in the U.S. --
child labor, forced labor,
serious health and safety abuses.
And eventually President Clinton, in 1996,
convened a meeting at the White House,
invited industry, human rights NGOs,
trade unions, the Department of Labor,
got them all in a room
and said, "Look,
I don't want globalization to be a race to the bottom.
I don't know how to prevent that,
but I'm at least going to use my good offices
to get you folks together
to come up with a response."
So they formed a White House task force,
and they spent about three years arguing
about who takes how much responsibility
in the global supply chain.
Companies didn't feel it was their responsibility.
They don't own those facilities.
They don't employ those workers.
They're not legally liable.
Everybody else at the table
said, "Folks, that doesn't cut it.
You have a custodial duty, a duty of care,
to make sure that that product
gets from wherever to the store
in a way that allows us to consume it,
without fear of our safety,
or without having to sacrifice our conscience
to consume that product."
So they agreed, "Okay, what we'll do
is we agree on a common set of standards,
code of conduct.
We'll apply that throughout
our global supply chain
regardless of ownership or control.
We'll make it part of the contract."
And that was a stroke of absolute genius,
because what they did
was they harnessed the power of the contract,
private power,
to deliver public goods.
the contract from a major multinational brand
to a supplier in India or China
has much more persuasive value
than the local labor law,
the local environmental regulations,
the local human rights standards.
Those factories will probably never see an inspector.
If the inspector did come along,
it would be amazing if they were able
to resist the bribe.
Even if they did their jobs,
and they cited those facilities for their violations,
the fine would be derisory.
But you lose that contract
for a major brand name,
that's the difference
between staying in business or going bankrupt.
That makes a difference.
So what we've been able to do
is we've been able to harness
the power and the influence
of the only truly transnational institution
in the global supply chain,
that of the multinational company,
and get them to do the right thing,
get them to use that power for good,
to deliver the key public goods.
to multinational companies.
They weren't set up to do this. They're set up to make money.
But they are extremely efficient organizations.
They have resources,
and if we can add the will, the commitment,
they know how to deliver that product.
Now, getting there is not easy.
Those supply chains I put up on the screen earlier,
they're not there.
You need a safe space.
You need a place where people can come together,
sit down without fear of judgment,
without recrimination,
to actually face the problem,
agree on the problem and come up with solutions.
We can do it. The technical solutions are there.
The problem is the lack of trust, the lack of confidence,
the lack of partnership
between NGOs, campaign groups,
civil society organizations
and multinational companies.
If we can put those two together in a safe space,
get them to work together,
we can deliver public goods right now,
or in extremely short supply.
and it's crazy to think
that if you're a 15-year-old Bangladeshi girl
leaving your rural village
to go and work in a factory in Dhaka --
22, 23, 24 dollars a month --
your best chance of enjoying rights at work
is if that factory is producing
for a brand name company
which has got a code of conduct
and made that code of conduct part of the contract.
It's crazy.
Multinationals are protecting human rights.
I know there's going to be disbelief.
You'll say, "How can we trust them?"
Well, we don't.
It's the old arms control phrase:
"Trust, but verify."
So we audit.
We take their supply chain, we take all the factory names,
we do a random sample,
we send inspectors on an unannounced basis
to inspect those facilities,
and then we publish the results.
Transparency is absolutely critical to this.
You can call yourself responsible,
but responsibility without accountability
often doesn't work.
So what we're doing is, we're not only enlisting the multinationals,
we're giving them the tools to deliver this public good --
respect for human rights --
and we're checking.
You don't need to believe me. You shouldn't believe me.
Go to the website. Look at the audit results.
Ask yourself, is this company behaving
in a socially responsible way?
Can I buy that product
without compromising my ethics?
That's the way the system works.
that governments are not protecting human rights around the world.
I hate the idea
that governments have dropped this ball
and I can't get used to the idea
that somehow we can't get them to do their jobs.
I've been at this for 30 years,
and in that time I've seen
the ability, the commitment, the will of government
to do this decline,
and I don't see them making a comeback right now.
So we started out thinking
this was a stopgap measure.
We're now thinking that, in fact,
this is probably the start
of a new way of regulating and addressing
international challenges.
Call it network governance. Call it what you will.
The private actors,
companies and NGOs,
are going to have to get together
to face the major challenges we are going to face.
Just look at pandemics --
swine flu, bird flu, H1N1.
Look at the health systems in so many countries.
Do they have the resources
to face up to a serious pandemic?
No.
Could the private sector and NGOs
get together and marshal a response?
Absolutely.
What they lack is that safe space
to come together, agree
and move to action.
That's what we're trying to provide.
that this often seems
like an overwhelming level of responsibility
for people to assume.
"You want me to deliver human rights
throughout my global supply chain.
There are thousands of suppliers in there."
It seems too daunting, too dangerous,
for any company to take on.
But there are companies.
We have 4,000 companies who are members.
Some of them are very, very large companies.
The sporting goods industry, in particular,
stepped up to the plate and have done it.
The example, the role model, is there.
And whenever we discuss
one of these problems that we have to address --
child labor in cottonseed farms in India --
this year we will monitor 50,000 cottonseed farms in India.
It seems overwhelming.
The numbers just make you want to zone out.
But we break it down to some basic realities.
comes down to a very simple proposition:
can I give this person their dignity back?
Poor people,
people whose human rights have been violated --
the crux of that
is the loss of dignity,
the lack of dignity.
It starts with just giving people back their dignity.
I was sitting in a slum outside Gurgaon
just next to Delhi,
one of the flashiest, brightest new cities
popping up in India right now,
and I was talking to workers
who worked in garment sweatshops down the road,
and I asked them what message they would like me to take to the brands.
They didn't say money.
They said, "The people who employ us
treat us like we are less than human,
like we don't exist.
Please ask them to treat us like human beings."
That's my simple understanding of human rights.
That's my simple proposition to you,
my simple plea to every decision-maker
in this room, everybody out there.
We can all make a decision
to come together
and pick up the balls and run with the balls
that governments have dropped.
If we don't do it,
we're abandoning hope,
we're abandoning our essential humanity,
and I know that's not a place we want to be,
and we don't have to be there.
So I appeal to you.
Join us, come into that safe space,
and let's start to make this happen.

[Excerpts from "Myth and Infrastructure"]
Miwa Matreyek!
Today I want to talk to you
about ethnic conflict
and civil war.
These are not normally the most cheerful of topics,
nor do they generally generate
the kind of good news
that this conference is about.
Yet, not only is there at least some good news
to be told about fewer such conflicts now
than two decades ago,
but what is perhaps more important
is that we also have come
to a much better understanding of what can be done
to further reduce the number
of ethnic conflicts and civil wars
and the suffering that they inflict.
Three things stand out:
leadership, diplomacy
and institutional design.
What I will focus on in my talk
is why they matter, how they matter,
and what we can all do
to make sure that they continue to matter
in the right ways,
that is, how all of us can contribute
to developing and honing the skills
of local and global leaders
to make peace
and to make it last.
But let's start at the beginning.
for many decades now,
and ethnic conflicts in particular
have been a near constant presence
as a major international security threat.
For nearly two decades now,
the news has been bad
and the images have been haunting.
In Georgia, after years of stalemate,
we saw a full-scale resurgence of violence
in August, 2008.
This quickly escalated into a five-day war
between Russia and Georgia,
leaving Georgia ever more divided.
In Kenya, contested presidential elections in 2007 --
we just heard about them --
quickly led to high levels
of inter-ethnic violence
and the killing and displacement
of thousands of people.
In Sri Lanka,
a decades-long civil war
between the Tamil minority
and the Sinhala majority
led to a bloody climax in 2009,
after perhaps as many as 100,000
people had been killed
since 1983.
In Kyrgyzstan, just over the last few weeks,
unprecedented levels of violence occurred
between ethnic Kyrgyz
and ethnic Uzbeks.
Hundreds have been killed,
and more than 100,000 displaced,
including many ethnic Uzbeks
who fled to neighboring Uzbekistan.
In the Middle East,
conflict between Israelis and Palestinians
continues unabated,
and it becomes ever more difficult
to see how, just how
a possible, sustainable solution
can be achieved.
Darfur may have slipped from the news headlines,
but the killing and displacement there
continues as well,
and the sheer human misery that it creates
is very hard to fathom.
And in Iraq, finally,
violence is on the rise again,
and the country has yet to form a government
four months after
its last parliamentary elections.
So are these now the images of the past?
Well, notwithstanding the gloomy pictures
from the Middle East, Darfur,
Iraq, elsewhere,
there is a longer-term trend
that does represent some good news.
Over the past two decades, since the end of the Cold War,
there has been an overall decline
in the number of civil wars.
Since the high in the early 1990s,
with about 50 such civil wars ongoing,
we now have 30 percent fewer
such conflicts today.
The number of people killed in civil wars
also is much lower today
than it was a decade ago or two.
But this trend is less unambiguous.
The highest level of deaths on the battlefield
was recorded between 1998 and 2001,
with about 80,000 soldiers, policemen and rebels
killed every year.
The lowest number of combatant casualties
occurred in 2003,
with just 20,000 killed.
Despite the up and down since then,
the overall trend --
and this is the important bit --
clearly points downward
for the past two decades.
is also less bad than it used to be.
From over 12,000 civilians
deliberately killed in civil wars
in 1997 and 1998,
a decade later,
this figure stands at 4,000.
This is a decrease by two-thirds.
This decline would be even more obvious
if we factored in the genocide in Rwanda
in 1994.
But then 800,000 civilians were slaughtered
in a matter of just a few months.
This certainly is an accomplishment
that must never be surpassed.
What is also important is to note
that these figures only tell part of the story.
They exclude people
that died as a consequence of civil war,
from hunger or disease, for example.
And they also do not properly account
for civilian suffering more generally.
Torture, rape and ethnic cleansing
have become highly effective,
if often non-lethal, weapons in civil war.
To put it differently,
for the civilians that suffer the consequences
of ethnic conflict and civil war,
there is no good war
and there is no bad peace.
Thus, even though every civilian killed,
maimed, raped, or tortured is one too many,
the fact that the number
of civilian casualties
is clearly lower today
than it was a decade ago,
is good news.
in which fewer people get killed.
And the big question, of course,
is why?
In some cases,
there is a military victory of one side.
This is a solution of sorts,
but rarely is it one
that comes without human costs
or humanitarian consequences.
The defeat of the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka
is perhaps the most recent example of this,
but we have seen similar
so-called military solutions
in the Balkans, in the South Caucasus
and across most of Africa.
At times, they are complimented
by negotiated settlements,
or at least cease-fire agreements,
and peacekeepers are deployed.
But hardly ever do they represent
a resounding success --
Bosnia and Herzegovina
perhaps more so than Georgia.
But for many parts of Africa,
a colleague of mine once put it this way,
"The cease-fire on Tuesday night
was reached just in time
for the genocide to start on Wednesday morning."
If there's no solution on the battlefield,
three factors can account
for the prevention of ethnic conflict and civil war,
or for sustainable peace afterwards:
leadership, diplomacy
and institutional design.
Take the example of Northern Ireland.
Despite centuries of animosity,
decades of violence
and thousands of people killed,
1998 saw the conclusion
of an historic agreement.
Its initial version was skillfully mediated
by Senator George Mitchell.
Crucially, for the long-term success
of the peace process in Northern Ireland,
he imposed very clear conditions
for the participation and negotiations.
Central among them,
a commitment
to exclusively peaceful means.
Subsequent revisions of the agreement
were facilitated by the British and Irish governments,
who never wavered in their determination
to bring peace and stability to Northern Ireland.
that were put in place in 1998
and their modifications
in 2006 and 2008
were highly innovative
and allowed all conflict parties
to see their core concerns and demands addressed.
The agreement combines a power-sharing arrangement
in Northern Ireland
with cross-border institutions
that link Belfast and Dublin
and thus recognizes
the so-called Irish dimension of the conflict.
And significantly,
there's also a clear focus
on both the rights of individuals
and the rights of communities.
The provisions in the agreement may be complex,
but so is the underlying conflict.
Perhaps most importantly,
local leaders repeatedly rose to the challenge of compromise,
not always fast
and not always enthusiastically,
but rise in the end they did.
Who ever could have imagined
Ian Paisley and Martin McGuinness
jointly governing Northern Ireland
as First and Deputy First Minister?
or does this kind of explanation
only hold more generally
in democratic and developed countries?
By no means.
The ending of Liberia's long-lasting civil war
in 2003
illustrates the importance
of leadership, diplomacy
and institutional design
as much as the successful prevention
of a full-scale civil war
in Macedonia in 2001,
or the successful ending
of the conflict in Aceh in Indonesia in 2005.
In all three cases,
local leaders were willing and able
to make peace,
the international community stood ready
to help them negotiate and implement an agreement,
and the institutions have lived up
to the promise that they held
on the day they were agreed.
and institutional design
also helps explain failures to achieve peace,
or to make it last.
The hopes that were vested in the Oslo Accords
did not lead to an end
of the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.
Not all the issues that needed to be resolved
were actually covered in the agreements.
Rather, local leaders committed
to revisiting them later on.
Yet instead of grasping this opportunity,
local and international leaders
soon disengaged
and became distracted
by the second Intifada, the events of 9/11
and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.
signed in 2005
turned out to be less comprehensive than envisaged,
and its provisions may yet bear the seeds
of a full-scale return to war
between north and south.
Changes and shortcomings in leadership,
more off than on international diplomacy
and institutional failures
account for this
in almost equal measure.
Unresolved boundary issues, squabbles over oil revenues,
the ongoing conflict in Darfur,
escalating tribal violence in the south
and generally weak state capacity
across all of Sudan
complete a very depressing picture
of the state of affairs
in Africa's largest country.
The failure to achieve
a negotiated solution for Kosovo
and the violence, tension
and de facto partition that resulted from it
have their reasons
in many, many different factors.
Central among them are three.
First, the intransigence of local leaders
to settle for nothing less
than their maximum demands.
Second, an international diplomatic effort
that was hampered from the beginning
by Western support for Kosovo's independence.
And third, a lack of imagination
when it came to designing institutions
that could have addressed the concerns
of Serbs and Albanians alike.
By the same token --
and here we have some good news again --
the very fact that there is a high-level,
well-resourced international presence
in Kosovo
and the Balkans region more generally
and the fact that local leaders on both sides
have showed relative restraint,
explains why things have not been worse
over the past two years since 2008.
where outcomes are less than optimal,
local leaders
and international leaders have a choice,
and they can make a difference for the better.
A cold war
is not as good
as a cold peace,
but a cold peace
is still better than a hot war.
Good news is also about learning the right lesson.
So what then distinguishes
the Israeli/Palestinian conflict
from that in Northern Ireland,
or the civil war in Sudan
from that in Liberia?
Both successes and failures
teach us several critically important things
that we need to bear in mind
if we want the good news to continue.
First, leadership.
In the same way in which ethnic conflict and civil war
are not natural
but man-made disasters,
their prevention and settlement
does not happen automatically either.
Leadership needs to be capable,
determined and visionary
in its commitment to peace.
Leaders need to connect to each other
and to their followers,
and they need to bring them along
on what is an often arduous journey
into a peaceful future.
Diplomacy needs to be well resourced,
sustained,
and apply the right mix of incentives and pressures
on leaders and followers.
It needs to help them reach an equitable compromise,
and it needs to ensure
that a broad coalition
of local, regional
and international supporters
help them implement their agreement.
Institutional design requires
a keen focus on issues,
innovative thinking
and flexible and well-funded implementation.
Conflict parties need to move away
from maximum demands
and towards a compromise
that recognizes each other's needs.
And they need to think
about the substance of their agreement
much more than about
the labels they want to attach to them.
Conflict parties also need to be prepared
to return to the negotiation table
if the agreement implementation stalls.
the most critical lesson of all is this:
Local commitment to peace
is all-important,
but it is often not enough
to prevent or end violence.
Yet, no amount of diplomacy
or institutional design
can make up for local failures
and the consequences that they have.
Therefore, we must invest
in developing leaders,
leaders that have the skills,
vision and determination
to make peace.
Leaders, in other words,
that people will trust
and that they will want to follow
even if that means
making hard choices.
Ending civil wars
is a process that is fraught with dangers,
frustrations and setbacks.
It often takes a generation to accomplish,
but it also requires us, today's generation,
to take responsibility
and to learn the right lessons
about leadership, diplomacy
and institutional design,
so that the child soldiers of today
can become the children of tomorrow.
So this is a story
of a place that I now call home.
It's a story of public education
and of rural communities
and of what design might do to improve both.
So this is Bertie County,
North Carolina, USA.
To give you an idea of the "where:"
So here's North Carolina, and if we zoom in,
Bertie County is in the eastern part of the state.
It's about two hours east
driving-time from Raleigh.
And it's very flat. It's very swampy.
It's mostly farmland.
The entire county
is home to just 20,000 people, and they're very sparsely distributed.
So there's only 27 people per square mile,
which comes down to about 10 people
per square kilometer.
in the demise of rural America.
We've seen this story all over the country
and even in places beyond the American borders.
We know the symptoms.
It's the hollowing out of small towns.
It's downtowns becoming ghost towns.
The brain drain --
where all of the most educated and qualified leave and never come back.
It's the dependence on farm subsidies
and under-performing schools
and higher poverty rates in rural areas
than in urban.
And Bertie County is no exception to this.
Perhaps the biggest thing it struggles with,
like many communities similar to it,
is that there's no
shared, collective investment
in the future of rural communities.
Only 6.8 percent of all our philanthropic giving in the U.S. right now
benefits rural communities,
and yet 20 percent of our population lives there.
It is the poorest county in the state.
It has one in three of its children living in poverty,
and it's what is referred to as a "rural ghetto."
The economy is mostly agricultural.
The biggest crops are cotton and tobacco,
and we're very proud of our Bertie County peanut.
The biggest employer is the Purdue chicken processing plant.
The county seat is Windsor.
This is like Times Square of Windsor that you're looking at right now.
It's home to only 2,000 people,
and like a lot of other small towns
it has been hollowed out over the years.
There are more buildings that are empty or in disrepair
than occupied and in use.
You can count the number of restaurants in the county
on one hand --
Bunn's Barbecue being my absolute favorite.
But in the whole county there is no coffee shop,
there's no Internet cafe,
there's no movie theater, there's no bookstore.
There isn't even a Walmart.
is about 60 percent African-American,
but what happens in the public schools
is most of the privileged white kids
go to the private Lawrence Academy.
So the public school students
are about 86 percent African-American.
And this is a spread from the local newspaper of the recent graduating class,
and you can see the difference is pretty stark.
So to say that the public education system
in Bertie County is struggling
would be a huge understatement.
There's basically no pool
of qualified teachers to pull from,
and only eight percent of the people in the county
have a bachelor's degree or higher.
So there isn't a big legacy
in the pride of education.
In fact, two years ago,
only 27 percent of all the third- through eighth-graders
were passing the state standard
in both English and math.
but I promise there is good news.
The biggest asset, in my opinion,
one of the biggest assets in Bertie County right now is this man:
This is Dr. Chip Zullinger,
fondly known as Dr. Z.
He was brought in in October 2007
as the new superintendent
to basically fix this broken school system.
And he previously was a superintendent
in Charleston, South Carolina
and then in Denver, Colorado.
He started some of the country's first charter schools
in the late '80s in the U.S.
And he is an absolute renegade and a visionary,
and he is the reason that I now live and work there.
So in February of 2009,
Dr. Zullinger invited us, Project H Design --
which is a non-profit design firm that I founded --
to come to Bertie and to partner with him
on the repair of this school district
and to bring a design perspective to the repair of the school district.
And he invited us in particular
because we have a very specific
type of design process --
one that results in appropriate design solutions
in places that don't usually have access
to design services or creative capital.
Specifically, we use these six design directives,
probably the most important being number two:
we design with, not for --
in that, when we're doing humanitarian-focused design,
it's not about designing for clients anymore.
It's about designing with people,
and letting appropriate solutions emerge from within.
we were based in San Francisco,
and so we were going back and forth
for basically the rest of 2009,
spending about half our time in Bertie County.
And when I say we, I mean Project H,
but more specifically, I mean myself and my partner, Matthew Miller,
who's an architect and a sort of MacGyver-type builder.
So fast-forward to today, and we now live there.
I have strategically cut Matt's head out of this photo,
because he would kill me if he knew I was using it
because of the sweatsuits.
But this is our front porch. We live there.
We now call this place home.
Over the course of this year that we spent flying back and forth,
we realized we had fallen in love with the place.
We had fallen in love with the place and the people
and the work that we're able to do
in a rural place like Bertie County,
that, as designers and builders,
you can't do everywhere.
There's space to experiment
and to weld and to test things.
We have an amazing advocate in Dr. Zullinger.
There's a nobility of real, hands-on,
dirt-under-your-fingernails work.
there is a huge need.
There is a total vacuum of creative capital in Bertie County.
There isn't a single licensed architect in the whole county.
And so we saw an opportunity
to bring design as this untouched tool,
something that Bertie County didn't otherwise have,
and to be sort of the -- to usher that in
as a new type of tool in their tool kit.
The initial goal became using design
within the public education system in partnership with Dr. Zullinger --
that was why we were there.
But beyond that, we recognized
that Bertie County, as a community,
was in dire need of a fresh perspective
of pride and connectedness
and of the creative capital
that they were so much lacking.
So the goal became, yes, to apply design within education,
but then to figure out how to make education
a great vehicle for community development.
to the intersection of design and education.
And I should say that these are three things that we've done in Bertie County,
but I feel pretty confident that they could work
in a lot of other rural communities
around the U.S. and maybe even beyond.
So the first of the three is design for education.
This is the most kind of direct, obvious
intersection of the two things.
It's the physical construction
of improved spaces and materials and experiences
for teachers and students.
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers
and the outdated textbooks
and the terrible materials that we're building schools out of these days.
And so this played out for us in a couple different ways.
The first was a series of renovations of computer labs.
So traditionally, the computer labs,
particularly in an under-performing school like Bertie County,
where they have to benchmark test every other week,
the computer lab is a kill-and-drill
testing facility.
You come in, you face the wall, you take your test and you leave.
So we wanted to change the way that students approach technology,
to create a more convivial and social space
that was more engaging, more accessible,
and also to increase the ability for teachers
to use these spaces for technology-based instruction.
So this is the lab at the high school,
and the principal there is in love with this room.
Every time he has visitors, it's the first place that he takes them.
of this educational playground system
called the learning landscape.
It allows elementary-level students to learn core subjects
through game play and activity
and running around and screaming and being a kid.
So this game that the kids are playing here --
in this case they were learning basic multiplication
through a game called Match Me.
And in Match Me, you take the class, divide it into two teams,
one team on each side of the playground,
and the teacher will take a piece of chalk
and just write a number on each of the tires.
And then she'll call out a math problem --
so let's say four times four --
and then one student from each team has to compete
to figure out that four times four is 16
and find the tire with the 16 on it and sit on it.
So the goal is to have all of your teammates sitting on the tires
and then your team wins.
And the impact of the learning landscape
has been pretty surprising and amazing.
Some of the classes and teachers have reported higher test scores,
a greater comfort level with the material,
especially with the boys,
that in going outside and playing,
they aren't afraid to take on
a double-digit multiplication problem --
and also that the teachers are able
to use these as assessment tools
to better gauge how their students
are understanding new material.
So with design for education, I think the most important thing
is to have a shared ownership of the solutions with the teachers,
so that they have the incentive and the desire to use them.
So this is Mr. Perry. He's the assistant superintendent.
He came out for one of our teacher-training days
and won like five rounds of Match Me in a row and was very proud of himself.
This is the most complex.
It's a systems-level look
at how education is administered
and what is being offered and to whom.
So in many cases this is not so much about making change
as it is creating the conditions
under which change is possible
and the incentive to want to make change,
which is easier said than done in rural communities
and in inside-the-box education systems
in rural communities.
So for us, this was a graphic public campaign
called Connect Bertie.
There are thousands of these blue dots all over the county.
And this was for a fund that the school district had
to put a desktop computer and a broadband Internet connection
in every home
with a child in the public school system.
Right now I should say,
there are only 10 percent of the houses
that actually have an in-home Internet connection.
And the only places to get WiFi
are in the school buildings, or at the Bojangles Fried Chicken joint,
which I find myself squatting outside of a lot.
Aside from, you know, getting people excited
and wondering what the heck these blue dots were all over the place,
it asked the school system
to envision how it might become a catalyst
for a more connected community.
It asked them to reach outside of the school walls
and to think about how they could play a role
in the community's development.
So the first batch of computers
are being installed later this summer,
and we're helping Dr. Zullinger develop some strategies
around how we might connect the classroom and the home
to extend learning beyond the school day.
which is where we are now,
is: design as education.
So "design as education" means
that we could actually teach design within public schools,
and not design-based learning --
not like "let's learn physics by building a rocket,"
but actually learning design-thinking
coupled with real construction and fabrication skills
put towards a local community purpose.
It also means that designers are no longer consultants,
but we're teachers,
and we are charged with growing creative capital
within the next generation.
And what design offers as an educational framework
is an antidote
to all of the boring, rigid, verbal instruction
that so many of these school districts are plagued by.
It's hands-on, it's in-your-face,
it requires an active engagement,
and it allows kids to apply all the core subject learning
in real ways.
So we started thinking
about the legacy of shop class
and how shop class -- wood and metal shop class in particular --
historically, has been something
intended for kids who aren't going to go to college.
It's a vocational training path.
It's working-class; it's blue-collar.
The projects are things like,
let's make a birdhouse for your mom for Christmas.
And in recent decades, a lot of the funding for shop class
has gone away entirely.
but this time orient the projects
around things that the community needed,
and to infuse shop class
with a more critical and creative-design-thinking studio process.
So we took this kind of nebulous idea
and have worked really closely with Dr. Zullinger for the past year
on writing this as a one-year curriculum
offered at the high school level to the junior class.
And so this starts in four weeks,
at the end of the summer,
and my partner and I, Matthew and I,
just went through the arduous and totally convoluted process
of getting certified as high school teachers to actually run it.
And this is what it looks like.
the Fall and the Spring,
the students spend three hours a day every single day
in our 4,500 square foot
studio/shop space.
And during that time, they're doing everything
from going out and doing ethnographic research and doing the need-finding,
coming back into the studio,
doing the brainstorming and design visualization
to come up with concepts that might work,
and then moving into the shop and actually testing them,
building them, prototyping them,
figuring out if they are going to work and refining that.
And then over the summer, they're offered a summer job.
They're paid as employees of Project H
to be the construction crew with us
to build these projects in the community.
So the first project, which will be built next summer,
is an open-air farmers' market downtown,
followed by bus shelters for the school bus system in the second year
and home improvements for the elderly in the third year.
So these are real visible projects
that hopefully the students can point to and say,
"I built that, and I'm proud of it."
This is Ryan.
She is 15 years old.
She loves agriculture and wants to be a high school teacher.
She wants to go to college, but she wants to come back to Bertie County,
because that's where her family is from, where she calls home,
and she feels very strongly about giving back
to this place that she's been fairly fortunate in.
So what Studio H might offer her
is a way to develop skills
so that she might give back in the most meaningful way.
He is really into dirtbike racing,
and he wants to be an architect.
So for him, Studio H offers him
a way to develop the skills he will need as an architect,
everything from drafting to wood and metal construction
to how to do research for a client.
He is 16 years old, loves hunting and fishing and being outside
and doing anything with his hands,
and so for him, Studio H means
that he can stay interested in his education
through that hands-on engagement.
He's interested in forestry, but he isn't sure,
so if he ends up not going to college,
he will have developed some industry-relevant skills.
is a different kind of classroom.
So this building downtown,
which may very well become the site of our future farmers' market,
is now the classroom.
And going out into the community and interviewing your neighbors
about what kind of food they buy
and from where and why --
that's a homework assignment.
And the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the end of the summer
when they have built the farmers' market and it's open to the public --
that's the final exam.
And for the community, what design and building offers
is real, visible, built progress.
It's one project per year,
and it makes the youth the biggest asset
and the biggest untapped resource
in imagining a new future.
is a small story --
13 students, it's two teachers,
it's one project in one place.
But we feel like this could work in other places.
And I really, strongly believe in the power of the small story,
because it is so difficult
to do humanitarian work at a global scale.
Because, when you zoom out that far,
you lose the ability to view people as humans.
of constant education
for the people that we work with and for
and for us as designers.
And let's face it, designers, we need to reinvent ourselves.
We need to re-educate ourselves around the things that matter,
we need to work outside of our comfort zones more,
and we need to be better citizens in our own backyard.
So while this is a very small story,
we hope that it represents a step in the right direction
for the future of rural communities
and for the future of public education
and hopefully also for the future of design.
I guess the story actually has to start
maybe back in the the 1960s,
when I was seven or eight years old,
watching Jacques Cousteau documentaries on the living room floor
with my mask and flippers on.
Then after every episode, I had to go up to the bathtub
and swim around the bathtub and look at the drain,
because that's all there was to look at.
And by the time I turned 16,
I pursued a career in marine science,
in exploration and diving,
and lived in underwater habitats, like this one off the Florida Keys,
for 30 days total.
Brian Skerry took this shot. Thanks, Brian.
And I've dived in deep-sea submersibles around the world.
And this one is the deepest diving submarine in the world,
operated by the Japanese government.
were on an expedition in this submarine
20 years ago in Japan.
And on my dive, I went down 18,000 feet,
to an area that I thought
would be pristine wilderness area on the sea floor.
But when I got there, I found
lots of plastic garbage and other debris.
And it was really a turning point in my life,
where I started to realize
that I couldn't just go have fun doing science and exploration.
I needed to put it into a context.
I needed to head towards conservation goals.
So I began to work
with National Geographic Society and others
and led expeditions to Antarctica.
I led three diving expeditions to Antarctica.
Ten years ago was a seminal trip,
where we explored that big iceberg, B-15,
the largest iceberg in history, that broke off the Ross Ice Shelf.
And we developed techniques
to dive inside and under the iceberg,
such as heating pads on our kidneys
with a battery that we dragged around,
so that, as the blood flowed through our kidneys,
it would get a little boost of warmth
before going back into our bodies.
But after three trips to Antarctica,
I decided that it might be nicer to work in warmer water.
And that same year, 10 years ago,
I headed north to the Phoenix Islands.
But before I do, I just want you to ponder this graph for a moment.
You may have seen this in other forms,
but the top line is the amount of protected area
on land, globally,
and it's about 12 percent.
And you can see that it kind of hockey sticks up
around the 1960s and '70s,
and it's on kind of a nice trajectory right now.
And that's probably because
that's when everybody got aware of the environment
and Earth Day
and all the stuff that happened in the '60s with the Hippies and everything
really did, I think, have an affect on global awareness.
But the ocean-protected area
is basically flat line
until right about now -- it appears to be ticking up.
And I do believe that we are at the hockey stick point
of the protected area in the ocean.
I think we would have gotten there a lot earlier
if we could see what happens in the ocean
like we can see what happens on land.
But unfortunately, the ocean is opaque,
and we can't see what's going on.
And therefore we're way behind on protection.
But scuba diving, submersibles
and all the work that we're setting about to do here
will help rectify that.
They were the world's largest marine-protected area
up until last week
when the Chagos Archipelago was declared.
It's in the mid-Pacific. It's about five days from anywhere.
If you want to get to the Phoenix Islands,
it's five days from Fiji,
it's five days from Hawaii, it's five days from Samoa.
It's out in the middle of the Pacific,
right around the Equator.
I had never heard of the islands 10 years ago,
nor the country, Kiribati, that owns them,
till two friends of mine who run a liveaboard dive boat in Fiji
said, "Greg, would you lead a scientific expedition up to these islands?
They've never been dived."
And I said, "Yeah.
But tell me where they are and the country that owns them."
So that's when I first learned of the Islands
and had no idea what I was getting into.
But I was in for the adventure.
Let me give you a little peek here of the Phoenix Islands-protected area.
It's a very deep-water part of our planet.
The average depths are about 12,000 ft.
There's lots of seamounts in the Phoenix Islands,
which are specifically part of the protected area.
Seamounts are important for biodiversity.
There's actually more mountains in the ocean than there are on land.
It's an interesting fact.
And the Phoenix Islands is very rich in those seamounts.
So it's a deep -- think about it in a big three-dimensional space,
very deep three-dimensional space
with herds of tuna, whales,
all kinds of deep sea marine life
like we've seen here before.
for these studies, early on,
and that's what the Islands look like -- you can see in the background.
They're very low to the water,
and they're all uninhabited, except one island
has about 35 caretakers on it.
And they've been uninhabited for most of time
because even in the ancient days,
these islands were too far away
from the bright lights of Fiji and Hawaii and Tahiti
for those ancient Polynesian mariners
that were traversing the Pacific so widely.
But we got up there,
and I had the unique and wonderful scientific opportunity and personal opportunity
to get to a place that had never been dived
and just get to an island and go, "Okay, where are we going to dive?
Let's try there,"
and then falling into the water.
Both my personal and my professional life changed.
that I had never seen before in the ocean --
schools of fish that were so dense
they dulled the penetration of sunlight from the surface,
coral reefs that were continuous
and solid and colorful,
large fish everywhere,
manta rays.
It was an ecosystem. Parrotfish spawning --
this is about 5,000 longnose parrotfish spawning
at the entrance to one of the Phoenix Islands.
You can see the fish are balled up
and then there's a little cloudy area there
where they're exchanging the eggs and sperm for reproduction --
events that the ocean is supposed to do,
but struggles to do in many places now
because of human activity.
The Phoenix Islands and all the equatorial parts of our planet
are very important for tuna fisheries,
especially this yellowfin tuna that you see here.
Phoenix Islands is a major tuna location.
And sharks -- we had sharks on our early dives,
up to 150 sharks at once,
which is an indication
of a very, very healthy, very strong, system.
of never-ending wilderness
would go on forever,
but they did finally come to an end.
And we explored the surface of the Islands as well --
very important bird nesting site,
some of the most important bird-nesting sites in the Pacific, in the world.
And we finished our trip.
And that's the area again.
You can see the Islands -- there are eight islands --
that pop out of the water.
The peaks that don't come out of the water are the seamounts.
Remember, a seamount turns into an island when it hits the surface.
Where do these exist?
Well they exist in the Republic of Kiribati,
and Kiribati is located in the Central Pacific
in three island groups.
In the west we have the Gilbert Islands.
In the center we have the Phoenix Islands,
which is the subject that I'm talking about.
And then over to the east we have the Line Islands.
It's the largest atoll nation in the world.
And they have
about 110,000 people
spread out over 33 islands.
They control 3.4 million cubic miles of ocean,
and that's between one and two percent
of all the ocean water on the planet.
And when I was first going up there,
I barely knew the name of this country 10 years ago,
and people would ask me,
"Why are you going to this place called Kiribati?"
And it reminded me of that old joke
where the bank robber comes out of the courthouse handcuffed,
and the reporter yells, "Hey, Willy. Why do you rob banks?"
And he says, "cause that's where all the money is."
And I would tell people, "Why do I go to Kiribati?
Because that's where all the ocean is."
They basically are one nation
that controls most of the equatorial waters
of the Central Pacific Ocean.
that is in dire danger.
Sea levels are rising,
and Kiribati, along with 42 other nations in the world,
will be under water within 50 to 100 years
due to climate change
and the associated sea-level rise from thermal expansion
and the melting of freshwater into the ocean.
The Islands rise only one to two meters
above the surface.
Some of the islands have already gone under water.
And these nations are faced with a real problem.
We as a world are faced with a problem.
What do we do with displaced fellow Earthlings
who no longer have a home on the planet?
The president of the Maldives
conducted a mock cabinet meeting
underwater recently
to highlight the dire straits of these countries.
So it's something we need to focus on.
But back to the Phoenix Islands,
which is the subject of this Talk.
okay, this is amazing, what we found.
I'd like to go back and share it with the government of Kiribati,
who are over in Tarawa,
the westernmost group.
So I started contacting them --
because they had actually given me a permit to do this --
and I said, "I want to come up and tell you what we found."
And for some reason they didn't want me to come,
or it was hard to find a time and a place, and it took a while,
but finally they said, "Okay, you can come.
But if you come, you have to buy lunch
for everybody who comes to the seminar."
So I said, "Okay, I'm happy to buy lunch.
Just get whatever anybody wants."
So David Obura, a coral reef biologist, and I went to Tarawa,
and we presented for two hours
on the amazing findings of the Phoenix Islands.
And the country never knew this. They never had any data from this area.
They'd never had any information from the Phoenix Islands.
After the talk, the Minister of Fisheries walked up to me
and he said, "Greg, do you realize
that you are the first scientist
who has ever come back
and told us what they did?"
He said, "We often issue these permits
to do research in our waters,
but usually we get a note two or three years later,
or a reprint.
But you're the first one who's ever come back and told us what you did.
And we really appreciate that. And we're buying you lunch today.
And are you free for dinner?"
and I went out to dinner with the Minister of Fisheries in Kiribati.
And over the course of dinner,
I learned that Kiribati gains most of its revenue --
it's a very poor country --
but it gains what revenue is has
by selling access to foreign nations
to take fish out of its waters,
because Kiribati does not have the capacity
to take the fish itself.
And the deal that they strike
is the extracting country
gives Kiribati five percent
of the landed value.
So if the United States
removes a million dollars'
worth of lobsters from a reef,
Kiribati gets 50,000 dollars.
And, you know, it didn't seem like a very good deal to me.
So I asked the Minister over dinner,
I said, "Would you consider a situation
where you would still get paid --
we do the math and figure out what the value of the resource is --
but you leave fish and the sharks
and the shrimp in the water?"
He stopped, and he said, "Yes, we would like to do that
to deal with our overfishing problem,
and I think we would call it a reverse fishing license."
He coined the term "reverse fishing license."
So I said, "Yes, a 'reverse fishing license.'"
really not knowing where to go at that point.
I went back to the States and started looking around
to see if I could find examples
where reverse fishing licenses
had been issued,
and it turned out there were none.
There were no oceanic deals
where countries were compensated for not fishing.
It had occurred on land,
in rainforests of South America and Africa,
where landowners had been paid
not to cut the trees down.
And Conservation International had struck some of those deals.
So I went to Conservation International
and brought them in as a partner
and went through the process
of valuing the fishery resource,
deciding how much Kiribati should be compensated,
what the range of the fishes were,
brought in a whole bunch of other partners --
the government of Australia,
the government of New Zealand, the World Bank.
The Oak Foundation and National Geographic
have been big funders of this as well.
And we basically founded the park
on the idea of an endowment
that would pay the equivalent lost fishing license fees
to this very poor country
to keep the area intact.
President Anote Tong.
He's a really important leader,
a real visionary, forward-thinking man,
and he told me two things when I approached him.
He said, "Greg, there's two things I'd like you to do.
One is, remember I'm a politician,
so you've got to go out and work with my ministers
and convince the people of Kiribati that this is a good idea.
Secondly, I'd like you to create principles
that will transcend my own presidency.
I don't want to do something like this
if it's going to go away after I'm voted out of office."
So we had very strong leadership, very good vision
and a lot of science, a lot of lawyers involved.
Many, many steps were taken to pull this off.
And it was primarily because Kiribati realized
that this was in their own self-interest to do this.
They realized that this was a common cause
that they had found
with the conservation community.
when this was all going full-swing,
a coral-bleaching event happened in the Phoenix Islands.
Here's this resource that we're looking to save,
and it turns out it's the hottest heating event
that we can find on record.
The ocean heated up as it does sometimes,
and the hot spot formed and stalled
right over the Phoenix Islands for six months.
It was over 32 degrees Celsius for six months
and it basically killed
60 percent of the coral.
So suddenly we had this area that we were protecting,
but now it appeared to be dead, at least in the coral areas.
Of course the deep-sea areas and the open ocean areas were fine,
but the coral, which everybody likes to look at, was in trouble.
Well, the good news is it's recovered
and recovering fast,
faster than any reef we've seen.
This picture was just taken by Brian Skerry a few months ago
when we returned to the Phoenix Islands
and discovered that, because it is a protected area
and has healthy fish populations
that keep the algae grazed down
and keep the rest of the reef healthy,
the coral is booming, is just booming back.
It's almost like if a person
has multiple diseases,
it's hard to get well, you might die,
but if you only have one disease to deal with, you can get better.
And that's the story with climate-change heating.
It's the only threat,
the only influence that the reef had to deal with.
There was no fishing, there was no pollution, there was no coastal development,
and the reef is on a full-bore recovery.
when we first brought this up and I got quite animated during the dinner
and said, "Well, I think that the conservation community
might embrace this idea, Minister."
He paused and put his hands together and said,
"Yes, Greg,
but the devil will be in the details," he said.
And it certainly was.
The last 10 years have been detail after detail
ranging from creating legislation
to multiple research expeditions
to communication plans,
as I said, teams of lawyers,
MOUs,
creating the Phoenix Islands Trust Board.
And we are now in the process of raising the full endowment.
Kiribati has frozen extracting activities
at its current state while we raise the endowment.
We just had our first PIPA Trust Board meeting three weeks ago.
So it's a fully functional
up-and-running entity
that negotiates the reverse fishing license with the country.
And the PIPA Trust Board holds that license
and pays the country for this.
So it's a very solid, very well thought-out,
very well grounded system,
and it was a bottom-up system,
and that was very important with this work,
from the bottom up to secure this.
So the conditions for success here are listed.
You can read them yourselves.
But I would say the most important one in my mind
was working within the market forces
of the situation.
And that insured that we could move this forward
and it would have both the self-interest of Kiribati
as well as the self-interest of the world.
that is: how do we scale this up?
How do we realize Sylvia's dream?
Where eventually do we take this?
Here's the Pacific
with large MPAs
and large conservation zones on it.
And as you can see,
we have a patchwork across this ocean.
I've just described to you the one story
behind that rectangular area in the middle, the Phoenix Islands,
but every other green patch on that
has its own story.
And what we need to do now
is look at the whole Pacific Ocean
in its entirety
and make a network of MPAs
across the Pacific
so that we have our world's largest ocean
protected and self-sustaining
over time.
Well, there's lots to talk about,
but I think I'm just going to play to start off.
♫ in the morning ♫
♫ I pour the coffee ♫
♫ I read the paper ♫

♫ So feed the fishes ♫
♫ You sing me happy birthday ♫
♫ Like it's gonna be ♫
♫ your last day ♫
♫ here on Earth ♫
So, I wanted to do something special today.
I want to debut a new song that I've been working on
in the last five or six months.
And there's few things more thrilling
than playing a song
for the first time in front of an audience,
especially when it's half-finished.
(Laughter)
I'm kind of hoping some conversations here
might help me finish it.
Because it gets into all sorts
of crazy realms.
And so this is basically a song
about loops,
but not the kind of loops that I make up here.
They're feedback loops.
And in the audio world
that's when the microphone gets too close
to its sound source,
and then it gets in this self-destructive loop
that creates a very unpleasant sound.
And I'm going to demonstrate for you.
(Laughter)
I'm not going to hurt you. Don't worry.
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫
♫ This is a loop, feedback loop ♫
♫ This is a -- (Feedback)
(Laughter)
-- but my point is it's the sound of self-destruction.
how that applies across a whole spectrum of realms,
from, say, the ecological, okay.
There seems to be a rule in nature
that if you get too close to where you came from,
it gets ugly.
So like, you can't feed cows their own brains
or you get mad cow disease,
and inbreeding and incest
and, let's see,
what's the other one?
Biological -- there's autoimmune diseases,
where the body attacks itself
a little too overzealously
and destroys the host,
or the person.
And then -- okay, this is where we get to the song --
kind of bridges the gap to the emotional.
in songs,
it's very difficult sometimes to make them lyrical.
And there's some things
you just don't need to have in songs.
So I'm trying to bridge this gap
between this idea and this melody.
And so, I don't know if you've ever had this,
but when I close my eyes sometimes
and try to sleep,
I can't stop thinking about my own eyes.
And it's like your eyes
start straining to see themselves.
That's what it feels like to me.
It's not pleasant.
I'm sorry if I put that idea in your head.
(Laughter)
It's impossible, of course, for your eyes to see themselves,
but they seem to be trying.
So that's getting a little more closer to a personal experience.
Or ears being able to hear themselves --
it's just impossible.
That's the thing.
So, I've been working on this song
that mentions these things
and then also imagines
a person who's been so successful
at defending themselves from heartbreak
that they're left to do the deed themselves,
if that's possible.
And that's what the song is asking.
All right.
It doesn't have a name yet.
♫ Give yourself a hand, the hand is your hand ♫
♫ And the eye that eyes itself is your eye ♫
♫ And the ear that hears itself is near ♫
♫ 'Cause it's your ear, oh oh ♫
♫ You've done the impossible now ♫
♫ Took yourself apart ♫
♫ You made yourself invulnerable ♫
♫ No one can break your heart ♫
♫ So you wear it out ♫
♫ And you wring it out ♫
♫ And you wear it out ♫
♫ And you break it yourself ♫
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫
♫ Breaking your own, break it yourself ♫
♫ Breaking your own ♫
(Applause)
(Applause)
All right.
It's kind of cool. Songwriters can sort of get away with murder.
You can throw out crazy theories
and not have to back it up with data
or graphs or research.
But, you know, I think reckless curiosity
would be what the world needs now,
just a little bit.
(Applause)
I'm going to finish up with a song of mine
called "Weather Systems."

(Laughter)
Dr. Gero is a brilliant
but slightly mad scientist
in the "Dragonball Z: Android Saga."
If you look very carefully,
you see that his skull has been replaced
with a transparent Plexiglas dome
so that the workings of his brain can be observed
and also controlled with light.
That's exactly what I do --
optical mind control.
who lusts after world domination,
my motives are not sinister.
I control the brain
in order to understand how it works.
Now wait a minute, you may say,
how can you go straight to controlling the brain
without understanding it first?
Isn't that putting the cart before the horse?
Many neuroscientists agree with this view
and think that understanding will come
from more detailed observation and analysis.
They say, "If we could record the activity of our neurons,
we would understand the brain."
But think for a moment what that means.
Even if we could measure
what every cell is doing at all times,
we would still have to make sense
of the recorded activity patterns,
and that's so difficult,
chances are we'll understand these patterns
just as little as the brains that produce them.
In this simulation, each black dot
is one nerve cell.
The dot is visible
whenever a cell fires an electrical impulse.
There's 10,000 neurons here.
So you're looking at roughly one percent
of the brain of a cockroach.
Your brains are about 100 million times
more complicated.
Somewhere, in a pattern like this,
is you,
your perceptions,
your emotions, your memories,
your plans for the future.
But we don't know where,
since we don't know how to read the pattern.
We don't understand the code used by the brain.
To make progress,
we need to break the code.
But how?
An experienced code-breaker will tell you
that in order to figure out what the symbols in a code mean,
it's essential to be able to play with them,
to rearrange them at will.
So in this situation too,
to decode the information
contained in patterns like this,
watching alone won't do.
We need to rearrange the pattern.
In other words,
instead of recording the activity of neurons,
we need to control it.
It's not essential that we can control
the activity of all neurons in the brain, just some.
The more targeted our interventions, the better.
And I'll show you in a moment
how we can achieve the necessary precision.
I don't claim that the ability to control the function of the nervous system
will at once unravel all its mysteries.
But we'll certainly learn a lot.
Now, I'm by no means
the first person to realize
how powerful a tool intervention is.
The history of attempts
to tinker with the function of the nervous system
is long and illustrious.
It dates back at least 200 years,
to Galvani's famous experiments
in the late 18th century and beyond.
Galvani showed that a frog's legs twitched
when he connected the lumbar nerve
to a source of electrical current.
This experiment revealed the first, and perhaps most fundamental,
nugget of the neural code:
that information is written in the form
of electrical impulses.
Galvani's approach
of probing the nervous system with electrodes
has remained state-of-the-art until today,
despite a number of drawbacks.
Sticking wires into the brain is obviously rather crude.
It's hard to do in animals that run around,
and there is a physical limit
to the number of wires
that can be inserted simultaneously.
I started to think,
"Wouldn't it be wonderful if one could take this logic
and turn it upside down?"
So instead of inserting a wire
into one spot of the brain,
re-engineer the brain itself
so that some of its neural elements
become responsive to diffusely broadcast signals
such as a flash of light.
Such an approach would literally, in a flash of light,
overcome many of the obstacles to discovery.
First, it's clearly a non-invasive,
wireless form of communication.
And second, just as in a radio broadcast,
you can communicate with many receivers at once.
You don't need to know where these receivers are,
and it doesn't matter if these receivers move --
just think of the stereo in your car.
It gets even better,
for it turns out that we can fabricate the receivers
out of materials that are encoded in DNA.
So each nerve cell
with the right genetic makeup
will spontaneously produce a receiver
that allows us to control its function.
I hope you'll appreciate
the beautiful simplicity
of this concept.
There's no high-tech gizmos here,
just biology revealed through biology.
As we zoom in on one of these purple neurons,
we see that its outer membrane
is studded with microscopic pores.
Pores like these conduct electrical current
and are responsible
for all the communication in the nervous system.
But these pores here are special.
They are coupled to light receptors
similar to the ones in your eyes.
Whenever a flash of light hits the receptor,
the pore opens, an electrical current is switched on,
and the neuron fires electrical impulses.
Because the light-activated pore is encoded in DNA,
we can achieve incredible precision.
This is because,
although each cell in our bodies
contains the same set of genes,
different mixes of genes get turned on and off
in different cells.
You can exploit this to make sure
that only some neurons
contain our light-activated pore and others don't.
So in this cartoon, the bluish white cell
in the upper-left corner
does not respond to light
because it lacks the light-activated pore.
The approach works so well
that we can write purely artificial messages
directly to the brain.
In this example, each electrical impulse,
each deflection on the trace,
is caused by a brief pulse of light.
And the approach, of course, also works
in moving, behaving animals.
sort of the optical equivalent of Galvani's.
It was done six or seven years ago
by my then graduate student, Susana Lima.
Susana had engineered the fruit fly on the left
so that just two out of the 200,000 cells in its brain
expressed the light-activated pore.
You're familiar with these cells
because they are the ones that frustrate you
when you try to swat the fly.
They trained the escape reflex that makes the fly jump into the air
and fly away whenever you move your hand in position.
And you can see here that the flash of light has exactly the same effect.
The animal jumps, it spreads its wings, it vibrates them,
but it can't actually take off
because the fly is sandwiched between two glass plates.
Now to make sure that this was no reaction of the fly
to a flash it could see,
Susana did a simple
but brutally effective experiment.
She cut the heads off of her flies.
These headless bodies can live for about a day,
but they don't do much.
They just stand around
and groom excessively.
So it seems that the only trait that survives decapitation is vanity.
(Laughter)
Anyway, as you'll see in a moment,
Susana was able to turn on the flight motor
of what's the equivalent of the spinal cord of these flies
and get some of the headless bodies
to actually take off and fly away.
They didn't get very far, obviously.
Since we took these first steps,
the field of optogenetics has exploded.
And there are now hundreds of labs
using these approaches.
since Galvani's and Susana's first successes
in making animals twitch or jump.
We can now actually interfere with their psychology
in rather profound ways,
as I'll show you in my last example,
which is directed at a familiar question.
Life is a string of choices
creating a constant pressure to decide what to do next.
We cope with this pressure by having brains,
and within our brains, decision-making centers
that I've called here the "Actor."
The Actor implements a policy that takes into account
the state of the environment
and the context in which we operate.
Our actions change the environment, or context,
and these changes are then fed back into the decision loop.
on this abstract model,
we constructed a simple one-dimensional world
for our favorite subject, fruit flies.
Each chamber in these two vertical stacks
contains one fly.
The left and the right halves of the chamber
are filled with two different odors,
and a security camera watches
as the flies pace up and down between them.
Here's some such CCTV footage.
Whenever a fly reaches the midpoint of the chamber
where the two odor streams meet,
it has to make a decision.
It has to decide whether to turn around
and stay in the same odor,
or whether to cross the midline
and try something new.
These decisions are clearly a reflection
of the Actor's policy.
Now for an intelligent being like our fly,
this policy is not written in stone
but rather changes as the animal learns from experience.
We can incorporate such an element
of adaptive intelligence into our model
by assuming that the fly's brain
contains not only an Actor,
but a different group of cells,
a "Critic," that provides a running commentary
on the Actor's choices.
You can think of this nagging inner voice
as sort of the brain's equivalent
of the Catholic Church,
if you're an Austrian like me,
or the super-ego, if you're Freudian,
or your mother, if you're Jewish.
the Critic is a key ingredient
in what makes us intelligent.
So we set out to identify
the cells in the fly's brain
that played the role of the Critic.
And the logic of our experiment was simple.
We thought if we could use our optical remote control
to activate the cells of the Critic,
we should be able, artificially, to nag the Actor
into changing its policy.
In other words,
the fly should learn from mistakes
that it thought it had made
but, in reality, it had not made.
So we bred flies
whose brains were more or less randomly peppered
with cells that were light addressable.
And then we took these flies
and allowed them to make choices.
And whenever they made one of the two choices,
chose one odor,
in this case the blue one over the orange one,
we switched on the lights.
If the Critic was among the optically activated cells,
the result of this intervention
should be a change in policy.
The fly should learn to avoid
the optically reinforced odor.
We're comparing two strains of flies,
each of them having
about 100 light-addressable cells in their brains,
shown here in green on the left and on the right.
What's common among these groups of cells
is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine.
But the identities of the individual
dopamine-producing neurons
are clearly largely different on the left and on the right.
Optically activating
these hundred or so cells
into two strains of flies
has dramatically different consequences.
If you look first at the behavior
of the fly on the right,
you can see that whenever it reaches the midpoint of the chamber
where the two odors meet,
it marches straight through, as it did before.
Its behavior is completely unchanged.
But the behavior of the fly on the left is very different.
Whenever it comes up to the midpoint,
it pauses,
it carefully scans the odor interface
as if it was sniffing out its environment,
and then it turns around.
This means that the policy that the Actor implements
now includes an instruction to avoid the odor
that's in the right half of the chamber.
This means that the Critic
must have spoken in that animal,
and that the Critic must be contained
among the dopamine-producing neurons on the left,
but not among the dopamine producing neurons on the right.
we were able to narrow down
the identity of the Critic
to just 12 cells.
These 12 cells, as shown here in green,
send the output to a brain structure
called the "mushroom body,"
which is shown here in gray.
We know from our formal model
that the brain structure
at the receiving end of the Critic's commentary is the Actor.
So this anatomy suggests
that the mushroom bodies have something to do
with action choice.
Based on everything we know about the mushroom bodies,
this makes perfect sense.
In fact, it makes so much sense
that we can construct an electronic toy circuit
that simulates the behavior of the fly.
In this electronic toy circuit,
the mushroom body neurons are symbolized
by the vertical bank of blue LEDs
in the center of the board.
These LED's are wired to sensors
that detect the presence of odorous molecules in the air.
Each odor activates a different combination of sensors,
which in turn activates
a different odor detector in the mushroom body.
So the pilot in the cockpit of the fly,
the Actor,
can tell which odor is present
simply by looking at which of the blue LEDs lights up.
depends on its policy,
which is stored in the strengths of the connection,
between the odor detectors
and the motors
that power the fly's evasive actions.
If the connection is weak, the motors will stay off
and the fly will continue straight on its course.
If the connection is strong, the motors will turn on
and the fly will initiate a turn.
Now consider a situation
in which the motors stay off,
the fly continues on its path
and it suffers some painful consequence
such as getting zapped.
In a situation like this,
we would expect the Critic to speak up
and to tell the Actor
to change its policy.
We have created such a situation, artificially,
by turning on the critic with a flash of light.
That caused a strengthening of the connections
between the currently active odor detector
and the motors.
So the next time
the fly finds itself facing the same odor again,
the connection is strong enough to turn on the motors
and to trigger an evasive maneuver.
but I find it exhilarating to see
how vague psychological notions
evaporate and give rise
to a physical, mechanistic understanding of the mind,
even if it's the mind of the fly.
This is one piece of good news.
The other piece of good news,
for a scientist at least,
is that much remains to be discovered.
In the experiments I told you about,
we have lifted the identity of the Critic,
but we still have no idea
how the Critic does its job.
Come to think of it, knowing when you're wrong
without a teacher, or your mother, telling you,
is a very hard problem.
There are some ideas in computer science
and in artificial intelligence
as to how this might be done,
but we still haven't solved
a single example
of how intelligent behavior
springs from the physical interactions
in living matter.
I think we'll get there in the not too distant future.
So there are a few things
that bring us humans together in the way that an election does.
We stand in elections; we vote in elections;
we observe elections.
Our democracies rely on elections.
We all understand why we have elections,
and we all leave the house on the same day
to go and vote.
We cherish the opportunity to have our say,
to help decide the future of the country.
The fundamental idea is that politicians
are given mandate to speak for us,
to make decisions on our behalf
that affect us all.
Without that mandate, they would be corrupt.
and so people will do lots of things
to get power and to stay in power,
including doing bad things to elections.
You see, even if the idea
of the election is perfect,
running a countrywide election is a big project,
and big projects are messy.
Whenever there is an election,
it seems like something always goes wrong,
someone tries to cheat,
or something goes accidentally awry --
a ballot box goes missing here,
chads are left hanging over here.
we have all these procedures around the election.
So for example, you come to the polling station,
and a poll station worker asks for your ID
before giving you a ballot form
and asking you to go into a voting booth
to fill out your vote.
When you come back out, you get to drop your vote
into the ballot box
where it mixes with all the other votes,
so that no one knows how you voted.
is what happens after that,
after you drop your vote into the ballot box.
And most people would go home
and feel sure that their vote has been counted,
because they trust
that the election system works.
They trust that election workers and election observers
do their jobs and do their jobs correctly.
The ballot boxes go to counting places.
They're unsealed and the votes are poured out
and laboriously counted.
Most of us have to trust
that that happens correctly for our own vote,
and we all have to trust that that happens correctly
for all the votes in the election.
So we have to trust a lot of people.
We have to trust a lot of procedures.
And sometimes we even have to trust computers.
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters
casting hundreds of millions of votes,
all to be counted correctly
and all the things that can possibly go wrong
causing all these bad headlines,
and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea
of trying to make elections better.
researchers have taken a step back
and thought about how we can do elections differently.
They've zoomed out and looked at the big picture.
And the big picture is this:
elections should be verifiable.
Voters should be able to check
that their votes are counted correctly,
without breaking election secrecy,
which is so very important.
And that's the tough part.
How do we make an election system completely verifiable
while keeping the votes
absolutely secret?
uses computers
but doesn't depend on them.
And the secret is the ballot form.
And if you look closely at these ballot forms,
you'll notice that the candidate list
is in a different order on each one.
And that means, if you mark your choices on one of them
and then remove the candidate list,
I won't be able to tell from the bit remaining
what your vote is for.
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value
in the form of this 2D barcode
on the right.
And there's some complicated cryptography
going on in there,
but what's not complicated
is voting with one of these forms.
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us,
and then we'll use the paper for verification.
You get one of these ballot forms at random,
and then you go into the voting booth,
and you mark your choices,
and you tear along a perforation.
And you shred the candidate list.
And the bit that remains, the one with your marks --
this is your encrypted vote.
So you let a poll station worker
scan your encrypted vote.
And because it's encrypted,
it can be submitted, stored
and counted centrally
and displayed on a website
for anyone to see, including you.
So you take this encrypted vote
home as your receipt.
And after the close of the election,
you can check that your vote was counted
by comparing your receipt
to the vote on the website.
And remember, the vote is encrypted
from the moment you leave the voting booth,
so if an election official wants to find out how you voted,
they will not be able to.
If the government wants to find out how you voted,
they won't be able to.
No hacker can break in
and find out how you voted.
No hacker can break in and change your vote,
because then it won't match your receipt.
Votes can't go missing
because then you won't find yours when you look for it.
Instead, we want to make the whole process
so transparent
that news media and international observers
and anyone who wants to
can download all the election data
and do the count themselves.
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly.
They can check
that the announced result of the election
is the correct one.
And these are elections
by the people, for the people.
So the next step for our democracies
are transparent
and verifiable elections.
I love video games.
I'm also slightly in awe of them.
I'm in awe of their power
in terms of imagination, in terms of technology,
in terms of concept.
But I think, above all,
I'm in awe at their power
to motivate, to compel us,
to transfix us,
like really nothing else we've ever invented
has quite done before.
And I think that we can learn some pretty amazing things
by looking at how we do this.
And in particular, I think we can learn things
about learning.
Now the video games industry
is far and away the fastest growing
of all modern media.
From about 10 billion in 1990,
it's worth 50 billion dollars globally today,
and it shows no sign of slowing down.
In four years' time,
it's estimated it'll be worth over 80 billion dollars.
That's about three times the recorded music industry.
This is pretty stunning,
but I don't think it's the most telling statistic of all.
The thing that really amazes me
is that, today,
people spend about
eight billion real dollars a year
buying virtual items
that only exist
inside video games.
This is a screenshot from the virtual game world, Entropia Universe.
Earlier this year,
a virtual asteroid in it
sold for 330,000 real dollars.
And this
is a Titan class ship
in the space game, EVE Online.
And this virtual object
takes 200 real people
about 56 days of real time to build,
plus countless thousands of hours
of effort before that.
And yet, many of these get built.
At the other end of the scale,
the game Farmville that you may well have heard of,
has 70 million players
around the world
and most of these players
are playing it almost every day.
really quite alarming to some people,
an index of something worrying
or wrong in society.
But we're here for the good news,
and the good news is
that I think we can explore
why this very real human effort,
this very intense generation of value, is occurring.
And by answering that question,
I think we can take something
extremely powerful away.
And I think the most interesting way
to think about how all this is going on
is in terms of rewards.
And specifically, it's in terms
of the very intense emotional rewards
that playing games offers to people
both individually
and collectively.
Now if we look at what's going on in someone's head
when they are being engaged,
two quite different processes are occurring.
On the one hand, there's the wanting processes.
This is a bit like ambition and drive -- I'm going to do that. I'm going to work hard.
On the other hand, there's the liking processes,
fun and affection
and delight
and an enormous flying beast with an orc on the back.
It's a really great image. It's pretty cool.
It's from the game World of Warcraft with more than 10 million players globally,
one of whom is me, another of whom is my wife.
And this kind of a world,
this vast flying beast you can ride around,
shows why games are so very good
at doing both the wanting and the liking.
Because it's very powerful. It's pretty awesome.
It gives you great powers.
Your ambition is satisfied, but it's very beautiful.
It's a very great pleasure to fly around.
And so these combine to form
a very intense emotional engagement.
The really interesting stuff about virtuality
is what you can measure with it.
Because what you can measure in virtuality
is everything.
Every single thing that every single person
who's ever played in a game has ever done can be measured.
The biggest games in the world today
are measuring more than one billion points of data
about their players, about what everybody does --
far more detail than you'd ever get from any website.
And this allows something very special
to happen in games.
It's something called the reward schedule.
And by this, I mean looking
at what millions upon millions of people have done
and carefully calibrating the rate,
the nature, the type, the intensity of rewards in games
to keep them engaged
over staggering amounts of time and effort.
Now, to try and explain this
in sort of real terms,
I want to talk about a kind of task
that might fall to you in so many games.
Go and get a certain amount of a certain little game-y item.
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
my mission is to get 15 pies
and I can get 15 pies
by killing these cute, little monsters.
Simple game quest.
Now you can think about this, if you like,
as a problem about boxes.
I've got to keep opening boxes.
I don't know what's inside them until I open them.
And I go around opening box after box until I've got 15 pies.
Now, if you take a game like Warcraft,
you can think about it, if you like,
as a great box-opening effort.
The game's just trying to get people to open about a million boxes,
getting better and better stuff in them.
but games are able
to make this process
incredibly compelling.
And the way they do this
is through a combination of probability and data.
Let's think about probability.
If we want to engage someone
in the process of opening boxes to try and find pies,
we want to make sure it's neither too easy,
nor too difficult, to find a pie.
So what do you do? Well, you look at a million people --
no, 100 million people, 100 million box openers --
and you work out, if you make the pie rate
about 25 percent --
that's neither too frustrating, nor too easy.
It keeps people engaged.
But of course, that's not all you do -- there's 15 pies.
Now, I could make a game called Piecraft,
where all you had to do was get a million pies
or a thousand pies.
That would be very boring.
Fifteen is a pretty optimal number.
You find that -- you know, between five and 20
is about the right number for keeping people going.
But we don't just have pies in the boxes.
There's 100 percent up here.
And what we do is make sure that every time a box is opened,
there's something in it, some little reward
that keeps people progressing and engaged.
In most adventure games,
it's a little bit in-game currency, a little bit experience.
But we don't just do that either.
of varying qualities and levels of excitement.
There's going to be a 10 percent chance you get a pretty good item.
There's going to be a 0.1 percent chance
you get an absolutely awesome item.
And each of these rewards is carefully calibrated to the item.
And also, we say,
"Well, how many monsters? Should I have the entire world full of a billion monsters?"
No, we want one or two monsters on the screen at any one time.
So I'm drawn on. It's not too easy, not too difficult.
So all this is very powerful.
But we're in virtuality. These aren't real boxes.
So we can do
some rather amazing things.
We notice, looking at all these people opening boxes,
that when people get to about 13 out of 15 pies,
their perception shifts, they start to get a bit bored, a bit testy.
They're not rational about probability.
They think this game is unfair.
It's not giving me my last two pies. I'm going to give up.
If they're real boxes, there's not much we can do,
but in a game we can just say, "Right, well.
When you get to 13 pies, you've got 75 percent chance of getting a pie now."
Keep you engaged. Look at what people do --
adjust the world to match their expectation.
Our games don't always do this.
And one thing they certainly do at the moment
is if you got a 0.1 percent awesome item,
they make very sure another one doesn't appear for a certain length of time
to keep the value, to keep it special.
that we evolved to be satisfied by the world
in particular ways.
Over tens and hundreds of thousands of years,
we evolved to find certain things stimulating,
and as very intelligent, civilized beings,
we're enormously stimulated by problem solving and learning.
But now, we can reverse engineer that
and build worlds
that expressly tick our evolutionary boxes.
So what does all this mean in practice?
Well, I've come up
with seven things
that, I think, show
how you can take these lessons from games
and use them outside of games.
The first one is very simple:
experience bars measuring progress --
something that's been talked about brilliantly
by people like Jesse Schell earlier this year.
It's already been done at the University of Indiana in the States, among other places.
It's the simple idea that instead of grading people incrementally
in little bits and pieces,
you give them one profile character avatar
which is constantly progressing
in tiny, tiny, tiny little increments which they feel are their own.
And everything comes towards that,
and they watch it creeping up, and they own that as it goes along.
5,000 pies, boring,
15 pies, interesting.
So, you give people
lots and lots of different tasks.
You say, it's about
doing 10 of these questions,
but another task
is turning up to 20 classes on time,
but another task is collaborating with other people,
another task is showing you're working five times,
another task is hitting this particular target.
You break things down into these calibrated slices
that people can choose and do in parallel
to keep them engaged
and that you can use to point them
towards individually beneficial activities.
It's your 100 percent factor. Games are brilliant at this.
Every time you do something, you get credit; you get a credit for trying.
You don't punish failure. You reward every little bit of effort --
a little bit of gold, a little bit of credit. You've done 20 questions -- tick.
It all feeds in as minute reinforcement.
This is absolutely crucial,
and virtuality is dazzling at delivering this.
If you look at some of the most intractable problems in the world today
that we've been hearing amazing things about,
it's very, very hard for people to learn
if they cannot link consequences to actions.
Pollution, global warming, these things --
the consequences are distant in time and space.
It's very hard to learn, to feel a lesson.
But if you can model things for people,
if you can give things to people that they can manipulate
and play with and where the feedback comes,
then they can learn a lesson, they can see,
they can move on, they can understand.
the element of uncertainty.
Now this is the neurological goldmine,
if you like,
because a known reward
excites people,
but what really gets them going
is the uncertain reward,
the reward pitched at the right level of uncertainty,
that they didn't quite know whether they were going to get it or not.
The 25 percent. This lights the brain up.
And if you think about
using this in testing,
in just introducing control elements of randomness
in all forms of testing and training,
you can transform the levels of people's engagement
by tapping into this very powerful
evolutionary mechanism.
When we don't quite predict something perfectly,
we get really excited about it.
We just want to go back and find out more.
associated with learning is called dopamine.
It's associated with reward-seeking behavior.
And something very exciting is just beginning to happen
in places like the University of Bristol in the U.K.,
where we are beginning to be able to model mathematically
dopamine levels in the brain.
And what this means is we can predict learning,
we can predict enhanced engagement,
these windows, these windows of time,
in which the learning is taking place at an enhanced level.
And two things really flow from this.
The first has to do with memory,
that we can find these moments.
When someone is more likely to remember,
we can give them a nugget in a window.
And the second thing is confidence,
that we can see how game-playing and reward structures
make people braver, make them more willing to take risks,
more willing to take on difficulty,
harder to discourage.
This can all seem very sinister.
But you know, sort of "our brains have been manipulated; we're all addicts."
The word "addiction" is thrown around.
There are real concerns there.
But the biggest neurological turn-on for people
is other people.
This is what really excites us.
In reward terms, it's not money;
it's not being given cash -- that's nice --
it's doing stuff with our peers,
watching us, collaborating with us.
a video game called EverQuest.
And in this video game,
there were two really big dragons, and you had to team up to kill them --
42 people, up to 42 to kill these big dragons.
That's a problem
because they dropped two or three decent items.
So players addressed this problem
by spontaneously coming up with a system
to motivate each other,
fairly and transparently.
What happened was, they paid each other a virtual currency
they called "dragon kill points."
And every time you turned up to go on a mission,
you got paid in dragon kill points.
They tracked these on a separate website.
So they tracked their own private currency,
and then players could bid afterwards
for cool items they wanted --
all organized by the players themselves.
Now the staggering system, not just that this worked in EverQuest,
but that today, a decade on,
every single video game in the world with this kind of task
uses a version of this system --
tens of millions of people.
And the success rate
is at close to 100 percent.
This is a player-developed,
self-enforcing, voluntary currency,
and it's incredibly sophisticated
player behavior.
a few ways in which these principles
could fan out into the world.
Let's start with business.
I mean, we're beginning to see some of the big problems
around something like business are
recycling and energy conservation.
We're beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies
like real-time energy meters.
And I just look at this, and I think, yes,
we could take that so much further
by allowing people to set targets
by setting calibrated targets,
by using elements of uncertainty,
by using these multiple targets,
by using a grand, underlying reward and incentive system,
by setting people up
to collaborate in terms of groups, in terms of streets
to collaborate and compete,
to use these very sophisticated
group and motivational mechanics we see.
In terms of education,
perhaps most obviously of all,
we can transform how we engage people.
We can offer people the grand continuity
of experience and personal investment.
We can break things down
into highly calibrated small tasks.
We can use calculated randomness.
We can reward effort consistently
as everything fields together.
And we can use the kind of group behaviors
that we see evolving when people are at play together,
these really quite unprecedentedly complex
cooperative mechanisms.
Government, well, one thing that comes to mind
is the U.S. government, among others,
is literally starting to pay people
to lose weight.
So we're seeing financial reward being used
to tackle the great issue of obesity.
But again, those rewards
could be calibrated so precisely
if we were able to use the vast expertise
of gaming systems to just jack up that appeal,
to take the data, to take the observations,
of millions of human hours
and plow that feedback
into increasing engagement.
that I want to leave you with.
It's about how individual engagement
can be transformed
by the psychological and the neurological lessons
we can learn from watching people that are playing games.
But it's also about collective engagement
and about the unprecedented laboratory
for observing what makes people tick
and work and play and engage
on a grand scale in games.
And if we can look at these things and learn from them
and see how to turn them outwards,
then I really think we have something quite revolutionary on our hands.
I'm a bug lover, myself --
but rather late.
majoring in zoology at Tel Aviv University,
I kind of fell in love with bugs.
And then, within zoology,
I took the course or the discipline of entomology,
And then I thought to myself, how can I be practical
or help in the science of entomology?
from bad bugs.
And then within plant protection,
as the use of living organisms
So it's a whole discipline in plant protection
aimed at the reduction of chemicals.
or these "good bugs" that we are talking about,
or in fact, natural control phenomenon,
for their own needs.
and you can distinguish between the good ones and the bad ones.
and browse through just a few examples.
What is a pest?
What damage does it actually inflict on the plant?
And what is the natural enemy,
And then you see what kind of damage it can inflict.
Parthenogenesis, as it's so called.
And they're very happy with that, apparently.
Here we are not talking about a predator.
but an eight-legged parasite, of course.
into the body fluids of the aphid.
but nothing will happen, in fact --
The birth is almost complete.
This is, of course, not the end of it.
transmitted by those thrip adults.
"minute," because it is rather small.
Here you can see the adult, black, and two young ones.
And again, in action.
This adult pierces the thrips,
And if we spread those minute pirate bugs, the good ones,
after wiping out the bad ones, the thrips.
So this is a very positive situation.
No harm to the developing fruit. No harm to the fruit set.
Everything is just fine under these circumstances.
or the biological control phenomenon.
there, we are mass-producing those predatory mites,
those minute pirate bugs,
and the Jordan Valley on the other hand,
And that's what we get.
You see in the upper left corner? You see a single predatory mite.
I have one gram of those predatory mites.
because we bring it to every cultural plot
Here we come with those natural enemies
in order to reverse a little bit of the wheel
In this table, you can actually see what is an impact
under protection,
And Israeli strawberries, even more --
80 percent of the pesticides,
especially those aimed against pest mites in strawberries.
especially if you ask growers, agriculturists:
Why biological control?
Why good bugs?
By the way, the number of answers you get
equals the number of people you ask.
you can definitely watch this:
grandparents with their grandchildren,
distributing the natural enemies, the good bugs,
So safety, with respect to the application,
It's the same, and it can happen very quickly.
resistance is extremely rare.
or, in fact, to my dream.
If we take the overall turnover
I think it's times 100 or something like that.
Twenty-five billion.
So actually, how can we do it?
And thirdly, also to increase awareness by the growers
to the potential of this industry.
Give nature a chance.
Sustainability represents
the what, the where and the how
of what is caught.
The who and the why are what's important to me.
I want to know the people behind my dinner choices.
I want to know how I impact them.
I want to know how they impact me.
I want to know why they fish.
I want to know how they rely on the water's bounty
for their living.
Understanding all of this enables us
to shift our perception of seafood
away from a commodity
to an opportunity
to restore our ecosystem.
It allows for us to celebrate the seafood
that we're also so fortunate to eat.
I think we call it restorative seafood.
Where sustainability is the capacity
to endure and maintain,
restorative is the ability to replenish and progress.
Restorative seafood allows for an evolving and dynamic system
and acknowledges our relationship with the ocean
as a resource,
suggesting that we engage to replenish the ocean
and to encourage its resiliency.
It is a more hopeful, it is a more human,
and is a more useful way of understanding our environment.
by lots in the marine conservation world --
are very handy; they're a wonderful tool.
Green, yellow and red lists [of] seafood species.
The association is very easy: buy green, don't buy red,
think twice about yellow.
But in my mind, it's really not enough
to just eat green list.
We can't sustain this without the measure of our success
really changing the fate of the species
in the yellow and the red.
But what if we eat only in the green list?
You've got pole-caught yellowfin tuna here --
comes from sustainable stocks.
Pole caught -- no bycatch.
Great for fishermen. Lots of money. Supporting local economies.
But it's a lion of the sea. It's a top predator.
Am I sitting down in a steakhouse to a 16-ounce portion of this?
Do I do this three times a week?
I might still be in the green list,
but I'm not doing myself, or you,
or the oceans any favors.
The point is that we have to have a context,
a gauge for our actions in all this.
Example: I've heard that red wine is great for my health --
antioxidants and minerals -- heart healthy.
That's great! I love red wine!
I'm going to drink so much of it. I'm going to be so healthy.
Well, how many bottles is it
before you tell me that I have a problem?
Well folks, we have a protein problem.
We have lost this sensibility
when it regards our food,
and we are paying a cost.
The problem is we are hiding that cost beneath the waves.
We are hiding that cost
behind the social acceptance of expanding waistlines.
And we are hiding that cost behind monster profits.
is that it really takes into account our needs.
Restorative seafood might best be represented
not by Jaws, or by Flipper, or the Gordon's fisherman,
but rather, by the Jolly Green Giant.
Vegetables:
they might yet save the oceans.
Sylvia likes to say that blue is the new green.
Well I'd like to respectfully submit
that broccoli green might then be the new blue.
We must continue to eat
the best seafood possible, if at all.
But we also must eat it with a ton of vegetables.
The best part about restorative seafood though
is that it comes on the half-shell
with a bottle of Tabasco and lemon wedges.
It comes in a five-ounce portion of tilapia
breaded with Dijon mustard and crispy, broiled breadcrumbs
and a steaming pile of pecan quinoa pilaf
with crunchy, grilled broccoli
so soft and sweet and charred and smoky on the outside
with just a hint of chili flake.
Whooo!
This is an easy sell.
And the best part is all of those ingredients are available
to every family at the neighborhood Walmart.
to save America from the way we eat.
Sylvia is campaigning to save the oceans
from the way we eat.
There's a pattern here.
Forget nuclear holocaust;
it's the fork that we have to worry about.
We have ravaged our Earth
and then used the food that we've sourced
to handicap ourselves in more ways than one.
So I think we have this whole eating thing wrong.
And so I think it's time
we change what we expect from our food.
Sustainability is complicated
but dinner is a reality that we all very much understand.
So let's start there.
Dan Barber and Alice Waters
are leading passionately the green food Delicious Revolution.
But green foods often represent
a way for us to disregard
the responsibility as eaters.
Just because it comes from a green source
doesn't mean we can treat it with disregard on the plate.
We have eco-friendly shrimp.
We can make them; we have that technology.
But we can never have any eco-friendly all-you-can-eat shrimp buffet.
It doesn't work.
Heart-healthy dinner is a very important part
of restorative seafood.
While we try to manage declining marine populations,
the media's recommending increased consumption of seafood.
Studies say that tens of thousands
of American grandmothers, grandfathers, mothers and fathers
might be around for another birthday
if we included more seafood.
That's a reward I am not willing to pass up.
But it's not all about the seafood.
It's about the way that we look at our plates.
is reduce the portion sizes on my plate.
A couple things happened.
I made more money.
People started buying appetizers and salads,
because they knew they weren't going to fill up on the entrees alone.
People spent more time engaging in their meals,
engaging with each other over their meals.
People got, in short, more of what they came there for
even though they got less protein.
They got more calories over the course of a diversified meal.
They got healthier. I made more money.
This is great.
Environmental consideration was served with every plate,
but it was served with a heaping mound
of consideration for human interests at the same time.
was begin to diversify the species that we served --
small silverfish, anchovies, mackerel, sardines were uncommon.
Shellfish, mussels, oysters,
clams, tilapia, char -- these were the common species.
We were directing tastes
towards more resilience, more restorative options.
This is what we need to favor.
This is what the green list says.
But this is also how we can actually begin to restore our environment.
those fashionable species,
that green list tuna that I was talking about earlier?
Well, if you must, I have a recipe for you.
It pretty much works with any big fish in the ocean,
so here we go.
Start with a 16-ounce portion of big fish.
Get a knife. Cut it into four portions.
Put it on four plates.
Mound up those four plates with vegetables
and then open up the very best bottle of Burgundy you have,
light the candles and celebrate it.
Celebrate the opportunity you have to eat this.
Invite your friends and neighbors over
and repeat once a year,
maybe.
I expect health
and joy and family and community.
I expect that producing ingredients,
preparing dishes and eating meals
is all part of the communion of human interests.
I was lucky enough that my father was a fantastic cook.
And he taught me very early on
about the privilege that eating represents.
I remember well the meals of my childhood.
They were reasonable portions of protein
served with copious quantities of vegetables
and small amounts of starch, usually rice.
This is still how I largely eat today.
I get sick when I go to steakhouses.
I get the meat sweats.
It's like a hangover from protein.
It's disgusting.
But of all the dire news that you'll hear
and that you have heard about the state of our oceans,
I have the unfortunate burden of delivering to you
possibly the very worst of it
and that is this whole time
your mother was right.
Eat your vegetables.
It's pretty straightforward.
Well for health, I'm looking for wholesome ingredients
that are good for my body.
For joy, I'm looking for butter and salt
and sexy things that make things taste less like penance.
For family, I'm looking for recipes
that genuflect to my own personal histories.
For community though, we start at the very beginning.
There's no escaping the fact
that everything we eat has a global impact.
So try and learn as best you can what that impact is
and then take the first step to minimize it.
We've seen an image of our blue planet,
our world bank.
But it is more than just a repository of our resources;
it's also the global geography
of the communion we call dinner.
So if we all take only what we need,
then we can begin to share the rest,
we can begin to celebrate,
we can begin to restore.
We need to savor vegetables.
We need to savor smaller portions of seafood.
And we need to save dinner.
I'm going to talk to you
about power in this 21st century.
And basically, what I'd like to tell you
is that power is changing,
and there are two types of changes
I want to discuss.
One is power transition,
which is change of power amongst states.
And there the simple version of the message
is it's moving from West to East.
The other is power diffusion,
the way power is moving
from all states West or East
to non-state actors.
Those two things
are the huge shifts of power
in our century.
And I want to tell you about them each separately
and then how they interact
and why, in the end, there may be some good news.
we often talk about the rise of Asia.
It really should be called
the recovery or return of Asia.
If we looked at the world
in 1800,
you'd find that more than half of the world's people
lived in Asia
and they made more than half the world's product.
Now fast forward to 1900:
half the world's people -- more than half -- still live in Asia,
but they're now making
only a fifth of the world's product.
What happened? The Industrial Revolution,
which meant that all of a sudden,
Europe and America
became the dominant center of the world.
What we're going to see in the 21st century
is Asia gradually returning
to being more than half of the world's population
and more than half of the world's product.
That's important and it's an important shift.
But let me tell you a little bit about
the other shift that I'm talking about,
which is power diffusion.
put this in your mind:
computing and communications costs
have fallen a thousandfold
between 1970
and the beginning of this century.
Now that's a big abstract number.
But to make it more real,
if the price of an automobile
had fallen as rapidly
as the price of computing power,
you could buy a car today
for five dollars.
Now when the price of any technology
declines that dramatically,
the barriers to entry go down.
Anybody can play in the game.
So in 1970,
if you wanted to communicate
from Oxford to Johannesburg
to New Delhi
to Brasilia
and anywhere simultaneously,
you could do it.
The technology was there.
But to be able to do it,
you had to be very rich --
a government, a multinational corporation,
maybe the Catholic Church --
but you had to be pretty wealthy.
Now, anybody has that capacity,
which previously was restricted by price
just to a few actors.
If they have the price of entry into an Internet cafe --
the last time I looked, it was something like a pound an hour --
and if you have Skype, it's free.
So capabilities
that were once restricted
are now available to everyone.
And what that means
The State still matters.
But the stage is crowded.
The State's not alone. There are many, many actors.
Some of that's good:
Oxfam,
a great non-governmental actor.
Some of it's bad:
Al Qaeda, another non-governmental actor.
But think of what it does
to how we think in traditional terms and concepts.
We think in terms of war
and interstate war.
And you can think back to 1941
when the government of Japan
attacked the United States at Pearl Harbor.
It's worth noticing
that a non-state actor
attacking the United States in 2001
killed more Americans
than the government of Japan did in 1941.
You might think of that
as the privatization of war.
So we're seeing a great change
in terms of diffusion of power.
that we're not thinking about it in very innovative ways.
So let me step back
and ask: what's power?
Power is simple the ability
to affect others
to get the outcomes you want,
and you can do it in three ways.
You can do it with threats
of coercion, "sticks,"
you can do it with payments,
"carrots,"
or you can do it by getting others
to want what you want.
And that ability to get others to want what you want,
to get the outcomes you want
without coercion or payment,
is what I call soft power.
And that soft power has been much neglected
and much misunderstood,
and yet it's tremendously important.
Indeed, if you can learn
to use more soft power,
you can save a lot
on carrots and sticks.
Traditionally, the way people thought about power
was primarily in terms of military power.
For example, the great Oxford historian
who taught here at this university, A.J.P. Taylor,
defined a great power
as a country able to prevail in war.
But we need a new narrative
if we're to understand power in the 21st century.
It's not just prevailing at war,
though war still persists.
It's not whose army wins;
it's also whose story wins.
And we have to think much more in terms of narratives
and whose narrative is going to be effective.
to the question
of power transition
between states
and what's happening there.
the narratives that we use now
tend to be the rise and fall
of the great powers.
And the current narrative is all about
the rise of China
and the decline of the United States.
Indeed, with the 2008 financial crisis,
many people said this was
the beginning of the end of American power.
The tectonic plates
of world politics were shifting.
And president Medvedev of Russia, for example,
pronounced in 2008
this was the beginning of the end
of United States power.
But in fact,
this metaphor of decline
is often very misleading.
If you look at history, in recent history,
you'll see the cycles of belief
in American decline
come and go every 10 or 15 years or so.
In 1958,
after the Soviets put up Sputnik,
it was "That's the end of America."
In 1973, with the oil embargo
and the closing of the gold window,
that was the end of America.
In the 1980s,
as America went through a transition in the Reagan period,
between the rust belt economy of the midwest
to the Silicon Valley economy of California,
that was the end of America.
But in fact, what we've seen
is none of those were true.
Indeed, people were over-enthusiastic
in the early 2000s,
thinking America could do anything,
which led us into some disastrous
foreign policy adventures,
and now we're back to decline again.
is all these narratives about rise and fall and decline
tell us a lot more about psychology
than they do about reality.
If we try to focus on the reality,
then what we need to focus on
is what's really happening
in terms of China and the United States.
Goldman Sachs has projected
that China, the Chinese economy,
will surpass that of the U.S.
by 2027.
So we've got, what,
17 more years to go or so
before China's bigger.
Now someday,
with a billion point three people getting richer,
they are going to be bigger than the United States.
But be very careful about these projections
such as the Goldman Sachs projection
as though that gives you an accurate picture
of power transition in this century.
Let me mention three reasons why it's too simple.
First of all, it's a linear projection.
You know, everything says,
here's the growth rate of China, here's the growth rate of the U.S.,
here it goes -- straight line.
History is not linear.
There are often bumps along the road, accidents along the way.
The second thing is
that the Chinese economy
passes the U.S. economy in, let's say, 2030,
which it may it,
that will be a measure of total economic size,
but not of per capita income --
won't tell you about the composition of the economy.
China still has large areas
of underdevelopment
and per capita income is a better measure
of the sophistication of the economy.
And that the Chinese won't catch up or pass the Americans
until somewhere in the latter part,
after 2050, of this century.
is how one-dimensional
this projection is.
You know, it looks at economic power
measured by GDP.
Doesn't tell you much about military power,
doesn't tell you very much about soft power.
It's all very one-dimensional.
And also, when we think about the rise of Asia,
or return of Asia
as I called it a little bit earlier,
it's worth remembering Asia's not one thing.
If you're sitting in Japan,
or in New Delhi,
or in Hanoi,
your view of the rise of China
is a little different than if you're sitting in Beijing.
Indeed, one of the advantages
that the Americans will have
in terms of power in Asia
is all those countries
want an American insurance policy
against the rise of China.
It's as though Mexico and Canada
were hostile neighbors to the United States,
which they're not.
So these simple projections
of the Goldman Sachs type
are not telling us what we need to know
about power transition.
Why does it matter? Who cares?
Is this just a game
that diplomats and academics play?
The answer is it matters quite a lot.
Because, if you believe in decline
and you get the answers wrong on this,
the facts, not the myths,
you may have policies which are very dangerous.
Let me give you an example from history.
The Peloponnesian War
was the great conflict
in which the Greek city state system
tore itself apart
two and a half millennia ago.
What caused it?
Thucydides, the great historian of the the Peloponnesian War,
said it was the rise in the power of Athens
and the fear it created in Sparta.
Notice both halves of that explanation.
that the 21st century
is going to repeat the 20th century,
in which World War One,
the great conflagration
in which the European state system
tore itself apart
and destroyed its centrality in the world,
that that was caused by
the rise in the power of Germany
and the fear it created in Britain.
So there are people who are telling us
this is going to be reproduced today,
that what we're going to see
is the same thing now in this century.
No, I think that's wrong.
It's bad history.
For one thing, Germany had surpassed Britain
in industrial strength by 1900.
And as I said earlier,
China has not passed the United States.
But also, if you have this belief
and it creates a sense of fear,
it leads to overreaction.
And the greatest danger we have
of managing this power transition
of the shift toward the East is fear.
To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt
from a different context,
the greatest thing we have to fear is fear itself.
We don't have to fear the rise of China
or the return of Asia.
And if we have policies
in which we take it
in that larger historical perspective,
we're going to be able
to manage this process.
about the distribution of power
and how it relates to power diffusion
and then pull these two types together.
If you ask how is power distributed in the world today,
it's distributed much like
a three-dimensional chess game.
Top board:
military power among states.
The United States is the only superpower,
and it's likely to remain that way
for two or three decades.
China's not going to replace the U.S. on this military board.
Middle board of this three-dimensional chess game:
economic power among states.
Power is multi-polar.
There are balancers --
the U.S., Europe,
China, Japan
can balance each other.
The bottom board of this three-dimensional,
the board of transnational relations,
things that cross borders outside the control of governments,
things like climate change, drug trade,
financial flows,
pandemics,
all these things that cross borders
outside the control of governments,
there nobody's in charge.
It makes no sense to call this unipolar
or multi-polar.
Power is chaotically distributed.
And the only way you can solve these problems --
and this is where many greatest challenges
are coming in this century --
is through cooperation,
through working together,
which means that soft power becomes more important,
that ability to organize networks
to deal with these kinds of problems
and to be able to get cooperation.
is that as we think of power in the 21st century,
we want to get away from the idea
that power's always zero sum --
my gain is your loss and vice versa.
Power can also be positive sum,
where your gain can be my gain.
If China develops greater energy security
and greater capacity
to deal with its problems of carbon emissions,
that's good for us
as well as good for China
as well as good for everybody else.
So empowering China
to deal with its own problems of carbon
is good for everybody,
and it's not a zero sum, I win, you lose.
It's one in which we can all gain.
So as we think about power
in this century,
we want to get away from this view
that it's all I win, you lose.
Now I don't mean to be Pollyannaish about this.
Wars persist. Power persists.
Military power is important.
Keeping balances is important.
All this still persists.
Hard power is there,
and it will remain.
But unless you learn how to mix
hard power with soft power
into strategies that I call smart power,
you're not going to deal with the new kinds of problems
that we're facing.
is how do we work together
to produce global public goods,
things from which all of us can benefit?
How do we define our national interests
so that it's not just zero sum,
but positive sum.
In that sense, if we define our interests,
for example, for the United States
the way Britain defined its interests in the 19th century,
keeping an open trading system,
keeping a monetary stability, keeping freedom of the seas --
those were good for Britain,
they were good for others as well.
And in the 21st century, you have to do an analog to that.
How do we produce global public goods,
which are good for us,
but good for everyone at the same time?
And that's going to be the good news dimension
of what we need to think about
as we think of power in the 21st century.
in which, while protecting ourselves with hard power,
we can organize with others in networks
to produce, not only public goods,
but ways that will enhance our soft power.
So if one looks at the statements
that have been made about this,
I am impressed that when Hillary Clinton
described the foreign policy
of the Obama administration,
she said that the foreign policy of the Obama administration
was going to be smart power,
as she put it, "using all the tools
in our foreign policy tool box."
And if we're going to deal
with these two great power shifts that I've described,
the power shift represented by transition among states,
the power shift represented
by diffusion of power away from all states,
we're going to have to develop a new narrative of power
in which we combine hard and soft power
into strategies of smart power.
And that's the good news I have. We can do that.
The big residual
is always value for money.
All the time we are trying to get value for money.
What we don't look for
is value for many,
while we are generating value for money.
Do we care about those four billion people
whose income levels are less than two dollars a day,
the so-called bottom of the pyramid?
What are the challenges in getting value for money
as well as value for many?
We have described here
in terms of the performance
and the price.
If you have money, of course, you can get the value.
You can get a Mercedes
for a very high price,
very high performance.
But if you don't have money, what happens?
Well, you are to ride a bicycle,
carrying your own weight and also some other weight,
so that you can earn the bread for the day.
Well, poor do not remain poor;
they become lower-middle-class.
And if they do so,
then, of course, the conditions improve,
and they start riding on scooters.
But the challenge is, again, they don't get much value,
because they can't afford anything more than the scooter.
The issue is, at that price,
can you give them some extra value?
A super value,
in terms of their ability to ride in a car,
to get that dignity, to get that safety,
looks practically impossible, isn't it.
that we see on Indian streets
all the time.
But many people see the same thing
and think things differently,
and one of them is here, Ratan Tata.
The great thing about our leaders
is that, should they not only have passion in their belly,
which practically all of them have,
they're also very innovative.
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done.
They believe that things can be done.
But great leaders like Ratan
have compassion.
And what you said, Lakshmi, is absolutely true:
it's not just Ratan Tata,
it's the house of Tatas over time.
Let me confirm what she said.
Yes, I went barefoot
until I was 12.
I struggled to [unclear] day
was a huge issue.
And when I finished my SSC, the eleventh standard,
I stood eleventh among 125,000 students.
But I was about to leave the school,
because my poor mother couldn't afford schooling.
And it was [unclear] Tata Trust, which gave me six rupees per month,
almost a dollar per month for six years.
That's how I'm standing before you.
So that is the House of Tata.
(Applause)
Innovation, compassion and passion.
They combine all that.
because when he saw -- in fact, he told me about eight or nine years ago
how he was driving his own car --
he drives his own car by the way --
and he saw in the rain,
a family like the one that I showed to you
getting drenched with an infant.
And then he said, "Well, I must give them a car that they can afford,
one lakh car, $2,000 car."
Of course, as soon as you say something like this
people say it is impossible,
and that's what was said by Suzuki.
He said, oh, probably he is going to build a three-wheeler
with stepney.
And you can see the cartoon here.
Well they didn't build that. They built a proper car. Nano.
And mind you, I'm six feet half an inch,
Ratan is taller than me,
and we have ample space in the front
and ample space in the back in this particular car.
And incredible car.
And of course, nothing succeeds like success;
the cynics then turned around,
and one after the other
they also started saying, "Yes, we also want to make a car in the Nano Segment.
We'll manufacture a car in the Nano Segment."
the making of Nano?
Let me tell you a bit about it.
For example, how we started:
Ratan just began with a five-engineer team,
young people in their mid-twenties.
And he said,
"Well, I won't define the vehicle for you,
but I will define the cost for you.
It is one lakh, 100,000 rupees,
and you are to make it within that."
And he told them,
"Question the unquestionable.
Stretch the envelope."
And at a point in time,
he got so engrossed in the whole challenge,
that he himself became a member of the team.
Can you believe it?
I still am told about this story
of that single wiper design in which he participated.
Until midnight, he'd be thinking.
Early morning he'll be coming back with sort of solutions.
But who was the team leader?
The team leader was Girish Wagh,
a 34 year-old boy in [unclear].
And the Nano team average age
was just 27 years.
Broke many norms of the standard conventions for the first time.
For example, that a two-cylinder gas engine
was used in a car with a single balancer shaft.
Adhesives were replacing the rivets.
There was a co-creation, a huge co-creation,
with vendors and suppliers.
All ideas on board were welcome.
100 vendors were co-located adjacent to the plant,
and innovative business models for automobile dealerships were developed.
Imagine that a fellow
who sells cloth, for example, will be selling Nano.
I mean, it was incredible innovation.
Seeking solutions for non-auto sectors.
It was an open innovation,
ideas from all over were welcome.
The mechanism of helicopters seats and windows was used, by the way,
as well as a dashboard
that was inspired by two-wheelers.
The fuel lines and lamps
were as in two-wheelers.
getting more from less.
All the time, you have been given an envelope.
You can't cross that envelope,
which is 100,000 rupees, 2,000 dollars.
And therefore, each component
had to have a dual functionality.
And the seat riser, for example,
serving as a mounting for the seat
as well as a structural part
of the functional rigidity.
Half the number of parts
are contained in Nano
in comparison to a typical passenger car.
The length is smaller by eight percent by the way.
But the current entry-level cars
in comparison to that is eight percent less,
but 21 percent more inside space.
was that -- more from less --
you can see how much more for how much less.
When the Model T was launched --
and this is, by the way, all the figures
that are adjusted to 2007 dollar prices --
Model T was 19,700 by Ford.
Volkswagon was 11,333.
And British Motor was around 11,000.
And Nano was, bang, 2,000 dollars.
This is why
you started
actually a new paradigm shift,
where the same people
who could not dream of sitting in a car,
who were carrying their entire family in a scooter,
started dreaming of being in a car.
And those dreams are getting fulfilled.
This is a photograph
of a house and a driver and a car
near my own home.
The driver's name is Naran.
He has bought his own Nano.
And you can see, there is a physical space
that has been created for him,
parking that car, along with the owner's car,
but more importantly, they've created
a space in their mind that
"Yes, my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it."
And that's why I call it a transformational innovation.
It is not just technological,
it is social innovation that we talk about.
this famous theme
of getting more from less for more
becomes important.
I remember talking about this for the first time in Australia,
about one and a half years ago,
when their academy honored me with a fellowship.
And unbelievably, in 40 years,
I was the first Indian to be honored.
And the title of my talk
was therefore "Indian innovation
from Gandhi to Gandhian engineering."
And I titled this more from less for more and more people
as Gandhian engineering.
And Gandhian engineering, in my judgment,
is the one which is going to take the world forward,
is going to make a difference,
not just for a few, but for everyone.
Let me move from mobility in a car to individual mobility
for those unfortunates
who have lost their legs.
Here is an American citizen and his son
having an artificial foot.
What is its price? 20,000 dollars.
And of course, these feet are so designed
that they can walk only on
such perfect pavement or roads.
You can see him walk barefoot
on an awkward land, sometimes in a marshy land,
and so on and so forth.
More importantly,
they not only walk far to work,
and not only do they cycle to work,
but they cycle for work, as you can see here.
And they climb up for their work.
You have to design an artificial foot for such conditions.
A challenge, of course.
Four billion people, their incomes are less then two dollars a day.
And if you talk about a 20,000-dollar shoe,
you're talking about 10,000 days of income.
You just don't have it.
And therefore, you ought to look at alternatives.
It had a revolutionary prosthetic fitment and delivery system,
a quick molding and modular components,
enabling custom-made, on-the-spot limb fitments.
You could feel it actually in an hour, by the way,
whereas the equivalent other feet
took something like a day, as so on.
Outer socket made by using heated high-density polyethylene pipes,
rather than using heated sheets.
And unique high-ankle design and human-like looks,
[unclear] and functions.
And I like to show how it looks
and how it works.
(Music)
See, he jumps. You can see what stress it must have.
... above the limb, yes, it would be difficult ...
"Did it hurt?"
"No ... not at all."
... he can run a kilometer in four minutes and 30 seconds ...)
(Applause)
So that's what it is all about.
And therefore Time took notice
of this 28-dollar foot, basically.
(Applause)
An incredible story.
I've been talking about getting more from less for more.
Let's move to health.
We've talked about mobility and the rest of it, let's talk about health.
What's happening in the area of health?
You know, you have new diseases that require new drugs.
And if you look at the drug development 10 years ago and now,
what has happened?
10 years ago, it used to cost about a quarter billion.
Today it costs 1.5 billion dollars.
Time taken for moving a molecule to marketplace,
after all the human and animal testing,
was 10 years, now it is 15 years.
Are you getting more drugs because you are spending more time and more money?
No, I'm sorry.
We used to have 40, now they have come down to 30.
So actually we are getting less from more
for less and less people.
Why less and less people? Because it is so expensive,
so very few will be able to basically afford that.
Psoriasis is very dreadful
disease of the skin.
The cost of treatment, 20,000 dollars.
1,000-dollar antibody injections under the skin, by the way,
and 20 of them.
Time for development -- it took around 10 years
and 700 million dollars.
Let's start in the spirit
of more from less and more for more
and start putting some targets.
For example, we don't want 20,000 dollars; we don't have it.
Can we do it [for] 100 dollars?
Time for development, not 10 years.
We are in a hurry. Five years.
Cost of development -- 300 million dollars.
Sorry. I can't spend more than 10 million dollars.
Looks absolutely audacious.
Looks absolutely ridiculous.
These targets have been achieved in India.
And how they have been achieved ...
Sir Francis Bacon once said,
"When you wish to achieve results
that have not been achieved before,
it is an unwise fancy to think
that they can be achieved by using methods
that have been used before."
And therefore, the standard process,
where you develop a molecule, put it into mice, into men,
are not yielding those results --
the billions of dollars that have been spent.
The Indian cleverness
was using its traditional knowledge,
however, scientifically validating it
and making that journey from men to mice to men,
not molecule to mice to men, you know.
And that is how this difference has come.
And you can see this blending
of traditional medicine, modern medicine, modern science.
I launched a big program
[unclear] CSIR about nine years ago.
He is giving us not just for Psoriasis,
for cancer and a whole range of things, changing the whole paradigm.
And you can see this Indian Psoriasis breakthrough
obtained by this reverse form of [unclear]
by doing things differently.
You can see before treatment and after treatment.
This is really getting more from less for more and more people,
because these are all affordable treatments now.
of what Mahatma Gandhi had said.
He had said, "Earth provides enough
to satisfy every man's need, but not every man's greed."
So the message he was giving us
was you must get more from less and less and less
so that you can share it for more and more people,
not only the current generation,
but the future generations.
And he also said, "I would prize every invention of science
made for the benefit for all."
So he was giving you the message that you must have it for more and more people,
not just a few people.
And therefore, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the theme, getting more
from less for more.
And mind you,
it is not getting just a little more for just a little less.
It's not about low cost.
It's about ultra-low cost.
You cannot say it's a mere treatment 10,000 dollars,
but because you are poor I'll give it for 9,000.
Sorry, it doesn't work. You have to give it for 100 dollars, 200 dollars.
Is it possible? It has been made possible, by the way,
for certain other different reasons.
So you are not talking about low cost, you are talking about ultra-low cost.
You are not talking about affordability,
you are talking about extreme affordability.
Because of the four billion people whose income is under two dollars a day.
You're not talking exclusive innovation.
You're talking about inclusive innovation.
And therefore, you're not talking about incremental innovation,
you're talking about disruptive innovation.
The ideas have to be such
that you think in completely different terms.
And I would also add,
it is not only getting more from less for more
by more and more people, the whole world working for it.
You know, incubators for infants, for example.
They're not available in Africa.
They're not available in Indian villages.
And infants die.
And incubator costs 2,000 dollars.
And there's a 25-dollar incubator
giving that performance that had been created.
And by whom?
By young students from Standford University
on an extreme affordability project that they had, basically.
Their heart is in the right place, like Ratan Tata.
It's not just innovation, compassion and passion --
compassion in the heart and passion in the belly.
That's the new world that we want to create.
And that is why the message is that of Gandhian engineering.
I was also afraid of those 18 minutes.
I've still one and a half to go.
The message, the final message, is this:
India gave a great gift to the world.
What was that?
[In the] 20th century, we gave Gandhi to the world.
The 21st century gift,
which is very, very important for the whole world,
whether it is global economic meltdown,
whether it is climate change --
any problem that you talk about
is gaining more from less for more and more --
not only the current generations,
for the future generations.
And that can come only from Gandhian engineering.
So ladies and gentlemen, I'm very happy to announce,
this gift of the 21st century
to the world from India,
Gandhian engineering.
Now, when you were a young boy in this school,
what were your thoughts, like what did you think you could become?
What do you think that drove you?
Was there a vision you had? What is it that drove you?
I remember, I went to a poor school,
because my mother could not gather the 21 rupees,
that half a dollar that was required
within the stipulated time.
It was [unclear] high school.
But it was a poor school with rich teachers, honestly.
And one of them was [unclear] who taught us physics.
One day he took us out into the sun
and tried to show us how to find
the focal length of a convex lens.
The lens was here. The piece of paper was there. He moved it up and down.
And there was a bright spot up there.
And then he said, "This is the focal length."
But then he held it for a little while, Lakshmi.
And then the paper burned.
When the paper burned, for some reason he turned to me,
and he said, "Mashelkar, like this,
if you do not diffuse your energies,
if you focus your energies,
you can achieve anything in the world."
That gave me a great message: focus and you can achieve.
I said, "Whoa, science is so wonderful,
I have to become a scientist."
But more importantly, focus and you can achieve.
And that message, very frankly,
is valuable for society today.
It has parallel lines, which are sun rays.
And the property of parallel lines
is that they never meet.
What does that convex lens do?
It makes them meet.
This is convex lens leadership.
You know what today's leadership is doing? Concave length.
They divide them farther.
So I learned the lesson
of convex lens leadership from that.
And when I was at National Chemical Laboratory [unclear].
When I was at Council of Scientific Industry Research --
40 laboratories -- when two laboratories were not talking to each other,
I would [unclear].
And currently I'm president of Global Research Alliance,
60,000 scientists in nine counties, right from India to the U.S.
I'm trying to build a global team,
which will look at the global grand challenges that the world is facing.
That was the lesson. That was the inspirational moment.
So yeah, I'm a newspaper cartoonist --
political cartoonist.
I don't know if you've heard about it -- newspapers?
It's a sort of paper-based reader.
(Laughter)
It's lighter than an iPad,
it's a bit cheaper.
You know what they say?
They say the print media is dying --
who says that? Well, the media.
But this is no news, right?
You've read about it already.
the world has gotten smaller.
I know it's a cliche, but look,
look how small,
how tiny it has gotten.
And you know the reason why, of course.
This is because of technology -- yeah.
(Laughter)
Any computer designers in the room?
Yeah well,
you guys are making my life miserable
because track pads used to be round,
a nice round shape.
That makes a good cartoon.
But what are you going to do with a flat track pad,
those square things?
There's nothing I can do as a cartoonist.
Well, I know the world is flat now.
That's true.
And the Internet has reached
every corner of the world,
the poorest, the remotest places.
Every village in Africa now has a cyber cafe.
(Laughter)
Don't go asking for a Frappuccino there.
So we are bridging the digital divide.
The Third World is connected,
we are connected.
And what happens next?
Well, you've got mail.
Yeah.
Well, the Internet has empowered us.
It has empowered you,
it has empowered me
and it has empowered some other guys as well.
I did them live
during a conference in Hanoi.
And they were not used to that
in communist 2.0 Vietnam.
(Laughter)
So I was cartooning live on a wide screen --
it was quite a sensation --
and then this guy came to me.
He was taking pictures of me and of my sketches,
and I thought, "This is great, a Vietnamese fan."
And as he came the second day,
I thought, "Wow, that's really a cartoon lover."
And on the third day, I finally understood,
the guy was actually on duty.
So by now, there must be a hundred pictures of me
smiling with my sketches
in the files of the Vietnamese police.
It has rocked the music industry;
it has changed the way we consume music.
For those of you old enough to remember,
we used to have to go to the store
to steal it.
(Laughter)
And it has changed the way
your future employer
will look at your application.
So be careful
with that Facebook account --
your momma told you, be careful.
And technology has set us free --
this is free WiFi.
But yeah, it has liberated us
from the office desk.
This is your life,
enjoy it.
(Laughter)
In short, technology, the internet,
they have changed our lifestyle.
Tech guru, like this man --
that a German magazine called the philosopher of the 21st century --
they are shaping the way we do things.
They are shaping the way we consume.
They are shaping our very desires.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You will not like it.
And technology has even changed
our relationship to God.
Religion and political cartoons,
as you may have heard,
make a difficult couple,
ever since that day of 2005,
when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark
drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world --
demonstrations, fatwa,
they provoked violence. People died in the violence.
This was so sickening;
people died because of cartoons.
I mean --
I had the feeling at the time
that cartoons had been used by both sides, actually.
They were used first by a Danish newspaper,
which wanted to make a point on Islam.
A Danish cartoonist told me he was one of the 24
who received the assignment to draw the prophet --
12 of them refused. Did you know that?
He told me, "Nobody has to tell me what I should draw.
This is not how it works."
And then, of course, they were used
by extremists and politicians on the other side.
They wanted to stir up controversy.
You know the story.
We know that cartoons can be used as weapons.
History tells us,
they've been used by the Nazis
to attack the Jews.
And here we are now.
In the United Nations,
half of the world is pushing
to penalize the offense to religion --
they call it the defamation of religion --
while the other half of the world is fighting back
in defense of freedom of speech.
So the clash of civilizations is here,
and cartoons are at the middle of it?
This got me thinking.
Now you see me thinking
at my kitchen table,
and since you're in my kitchen,
please meet my wife.
I went Ivory Coast --
Western Africa.
Now, talk of a divided place -- the country was cut in two.
You had a rebellion in the North,
the government in the South -- the capital, Abidjan --
and in the middle, the French army.
This looks like a giant hamburger.
You don't want to be the ham in the middle.
I was there to report on that story
in cartoons.
I've been doing this for the last 15 years;
it's my side job, if you want.
So you see the style is different.
This is more serious than maybe editorial cartooning.
I went to places like Gaza
during the war in 2009.
So this is really journalism in cartoons.
You'll hear more and more about it.
This is the future of journalism, I think.
Those were poor guys fighting for their rights.
There was an ethnic side to this conflict
as very often in Africa.
And I went to see the Dozo.
The Dozo, they are the traditional hunters
of West Africa.
People fear them --
they help the rebellion a lot.
They are believed to have magical powers.
They can disappear and escape bullets.
I went to see a Dozo chief;
he told me about his magical powers.
He said, "I can chop your head off right away
and bring you back to life."
I said, "Well, maybe we don't have time for this right now."
(Laughter)
"Another time."
I was given a chance to lead a workshop
with local cartoonists there
and I thought, yes,
in a context like this, cartoons can really be used as weapons
against the other side.
I mean, the press in Ivory Coast was bitterly divided --
it was compared to the media in Rwanda
before the genocide --
so imagine.
And what can a cartoonist do?
Sometimes editors would tell their cartoonists
to draw what they wanted to see,
and the guy has to feed his family, right?
So the idea was pretty simple.
We brought together cartoonists
from all sides in Ivory Coast.
We took them away from their newspaper for three days.
And I asked them to do a project together,
tackle the issues affecting their country
in cartoons, yes, in cartoons.
Show the positive power of cartoons.
It's a great tool of communication
for bad or for good.
And cartoons can cross boundaries,
as you have seen.
And humor is a good way, I think,
to address serious issues.
And I'm very proud of what they did.
I mean, they didn't agree with each other -- that was not the point.
And I didn't ask them to do nice cartoons.
The first day, they were even shouting at each other.
But they came up with a book,
looking back at 13 years
of political crisis in Ivory Coast.
And I've been doing projects like this,
in 2009 in Lebanon,
this year in Kenya, back in January.
In Lebanon, it was not a book.
The idea was to have --
the same principal, a divided country --
take cartoonists from all sides
and let them do something together.
So in Lebanon,
we enrolled the newspaper editors,
and we got them to publish
eight cartoonists from all sides all together on the same page,
addressing the issue affecting Lebanon,
like religion in politics and everyday life.
And it worked.
For three days, almost all the newspapers of Beirut
published all those cartoonists together --
anti-government,
pro-government,
Christian,
Muslim, of course,
English-speaking, well, you name it.
So this was a great project.
And then in Kenya, what we did
was addressing the issue of ethnicity,
which is a poison in a lot of places in Africa.
And we did video clips --
you can see them if you go to YouTube/Kenyatoons.
is easy here,
but as you have seen
in contexts of repression or division,
again, what can a cartoonist do?
He has to keep his job.
Well I believe that in any context anywhere,
he always has the choice at least
not to do a cartoon
that will feed hatred.
And that's the message I try to convey to them.
I think we all always have the choice in the end
not to do the bad thing.
But we need to support
these independent, critical
and responsible voices
in Africa, in Lebanon,
in your local newspaper,
in the Apple store.
Today, tech companies
are the world's largest editors.
They decide what is too offensive
or too provocative for you to see.
So really, it's not about the freedom of cartoonists;
it's about your freedoms.
And for dictators all over the world,
the good news
is when cartoonists,
journalists and activists shut up.
(Music)
I'm a visual artist,
and I'm also one of the co-founders of the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
I've been working with plastic bags,
which I cut up and sew back together as my primary material for my artwork
for the last 20 years.
I turn them into two and three-dimensional pieces
and sculptures and installations.
Upon working with the plastic, after about the first eight years,
some of my work started to fissure
and break down into smaller little bits of plastic.
And I thought, "Great.
It's ephemeral just like us."
I actually realized this was a bad thing.
It's a bad thing that plastic breaks down into smaller little bits,
because it's always still plastic.
And what we're finding
is that a lot of it is in the marine environment.
I then, in the last few years,
learned about the Pacific garbage patch and the gyre.
And my initial reaction --
and I think this is a lot of people's first reaction
to learning about it --
is, "Oh my God!
We've got to go out there and clean this thing up."
So I actually developed a proposal
to go out with a cargo ship
and two decommissioned fishing trawlers,
a crane, a chipping machine
and a cold-molding machine.
And my intention was to go out to the gyre,
raise awareness about this issue
and begin to pick up the plastic,
chip it into little bits and cold mold it into bricks
that could potentially be used as building materials
in underdeveloped communities.
who actually had been out to the gyre
and were studying the plastic problem in the marine environment
and upon doing so,
I realized actually that cleaning it up
would be a very small drop in the bucket
relative to how much is being generated
every day around the world,
and that actually I needed to back up and look at the bigger picture.
And the bigger picture is:
we need to find a way to turn off the faucet.
We need to cut the spigot
of single-use and disposable plastics,
which are entering the marine environment every day
on a global scale.
I wasn't just concerned about plastic
that you're trying to imagine out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean --
of which I have learned there are now
11 gyres, potentially, of plastic
in five major oceans in the world.
It's not just that gyre of plastic that I'm concerned about --
it's the gyre of plastic in the supermarket.
I'd go to the supermarket and all of my food is packaged in plastic.
All of my beverages are packaged in plastic,
even at the health food market.
I'm also concerned about the plastic in the refrigerator,
and I'm concerned about the plastic and the toxins that leach from plastic
into us and into our bodies.
who were all looking at this issue,
and we created the Plastic Pollution Coalition.
We have many initiatives that we're working on,
but some of them are very basic.
One is: if 80 to 90 percent
of what we're finding in the ocean --
of the marine debris that we're finding in the ocean -- is plastic,
then why don't we call it what it is.
It's plastic pollution.
Recycling -- everybody kind of ends their books
about being sustainable and greening with the idea of recycling.
You put something in a bin and you don't have to think about it again.
What is the reality of that?
In the United States, less than seven percent of our plastics are recycled.
And if you really look into it,
particularly when it comes to plastic bottles,
most of it is only down-cycled,
or incinerated, or shipped to China.
It is down-cycled and turned into lesser things,
while a glass bottle can be a glass bottle again
or can be used again --
a plastic bottle can never be a plastic bottle again.
Another thing that we're looking at and asking people to think about
is we've added a fourth R
onto the front
of the "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle," three R's,
and that is refuse.
Whenever possible, refuse single-use and disposable plastics.
Alternatives exist;
some of them are very old-school.
I myself am now collecting these cool Pyrex containers
and using those instead of Glad and Tupperware containers
to store food in.
And I know that I am doing a service
to myself and my family.
It's very easy to pick up a stainless-steel bottle
or a glass bottle,
if you're traveling and you've forgotten to bring your stainless-steel bottle
and fill that up with water or filtered water,
versus purchasing plastic bottled water.
and I know that you guys know a lot about this issue --
is that this is a huge problem in the oceans,
but this is a problem that we've created as consumers
and we can solve.
We can solve this by raising awareness of the issue
and teaching people to choose alternatives.
So whenever possible, to choose alternatives
to single-use plastics.
We can cut the stem -- tide the stem of this
into our oceans
and in doing so,
save our oceans, save our planet, save ourselves.
This technology
made a very important impact on us.
It changed the way our history developed.
But it's a technology so pervasive,
so invisible,
that we, for a long time,
forgot to take it into account
when we talked about
human evolution.
But we see the results of this technology, still.
So let's make a little test.
So everyone of you turns to their neighbor please.
Turn and face your neighbors.
Please, also on the balcony.
Smile. Smile. Open the mouths.
Smile, friendly.
(Laughter)
Do you --
Do you see any Canine teeth?
(Laughter)
Count Dracula teeth
in the mouths of your neighbors?
Of course not.
Because our dental anatomy
is actually made,
not for tearing down raw meat from bones
or chewing fibrous leaves for hours.
It is made for a diet
which is soft, mushy,
which is reduced in fibers,
which is very easily chewable
and digestible.
Sounds like fast food, doesn't it.
that cooking,
food transformation,
made us what we are.
So I would suggest that we change how we classify ourselves.
We talk about ourselves as omnivores.
from coquere, to cook.
We are the animals
who eat cooked food.
No, no, no, no. Better --
to live of cooked food.
So cooking is a very important technology.
It's technology.
I don't know how you feel,
to be successful.
So, cooking is a very important technology,
because it allowed us to acquire
what brought you all here:
the big brain,
this wonderful cerebral cortex we have.
Because brains are expensive.
Those have to pay tuition fees know.
(Laughter)
You now, our brain is two to three percent of the body mass,
but actually it uses 25 percent of the total energy we use.
It's very expensive.
Where does the energy come from. Of course, from food.
If we eat raw food,
we cannot release really the energy.
So this ingenuity of our ancestors,
to invent this most marvelous technology.
Invisible -- everyone of us does it every day, so to speak.
Cooking made it possible
could develop us.
this unleashing human potential,
which was possible by cooking and food,
why do we talk so badly about food?
Why is it always do and don'ts
and it's good for you, it's not good for you?
I think the good news for me
would be if we could go back
and talk about the unleashing,
the continuation of the unleashing of human potential.
Now, cooking allowed also
that we became a migrant species.
We walked out of Africa two times.
We populated all the ecologies.
you will try to transform it.
It keeps also your brain working.
Now the very easy and simple technology
which was developed
actually runs after this formula.
Take something which looks like food, transform it,
and it gives you a good, very easy, accessible energy.
the brain and the gut, which it actually affected.
The brain could grow, but the gut actually shrunk.
Okay, it's not obvious to be honest.
(Laughter)
But it shrunk to 60 percent
of primate gut
of my body mass.
So because of having cooked food,
it's easier to digest.
Now having a large brain, as you know,
is a big advantage,
because you can actually influence your environment.
How did it actually interfere?
What kind of criteria did it use?
And this is actually taste reward and energy.
You know we have up to five tastes,
three of them sustain us.
Sweet -- energy.
Umami -- this is a meaty taste.
You need proteins for muscles, recovery.
Salty,
because you need salt, otherwise your electric body will not work.
And two tastes which protect you --
bitter and sour,
which are against
poisonous and rotten material.
But of course, they are hard-wired
but we use them still in a sophisticated way.
Think about bittersweet chocolate;
or think about the acidity
of yogurt -- wonderful --
mixed with strawberry fruits.
because we know
that, in cooking, we can transform it
to the form.
Reward: this is a more complex
and especially integrative
form of our brain
with various different elements --
the external states, our internal states,
how do we feel, and so on are put together.
And something which maybe you don't like
but you are so hungry that you really will be satisfied to eat.
And as I say, energy was necessary.
participate in this development?
And the gut is a silent voice --
it's going more for feelings.
I use the euphemism digestive comfort --
actually -- it's a digestive discomfort,
which the gut is concerned with.
If you get a stomach ache, if you get a little bit bloated,
was not the right food, was not the right cooking manipulation
or maybe other things went wrong.
So my story is a tale of two brains,
because it might surprise you,
our gut has a full-fledged brain.
All the managers in the room say,
(Laughter)
And actually you use it and it's actually useful.
and make decisions.
But what it means
to have a brain there
is that, not only the big brain
because we have to learn actually
how to talk to the brains.
we should also learn to talk with this brain.
Now 150 years ago,
anatomists described very, very carefully --
here is a model of a wall of a gut.
I took the three elements --
stomach, small intestine and colon.
And within this structure,
you see these two pinkish layers,
which are actually the muscle.
And between this muscle, they found nervous tissues,
a lot of nervous tissues,
which penetrate actually the muscle --
penetrate the submucosa,
where you have all the elements for the immune system.
The gut is actually the largest immune system,
defending your body.
It penetrates the mucosa.
This is the layer which actually touches the food you are swallowing
and you digest,
which is actually the lumen.
Now if you think about the gut,
the gut is -- if you could stretch it --
40 meters long,
the length of a tennis court.
If we could unroll it,
get out all the folds and so on,
it would have 400 sq. meters of surface.
to move it with the muscles and to do defend the surface
and, of course, digest our food we cook.
So if we give you a specification,
this brain, which is autonomous,
have 500 million nerve cells,
100 million neurons --
so around the size of a cat brain,
so there sleeps a little cat --
thinks for itself,
optimizes whatever it digests.
It has 20 different neuron types.
It's got the same diversity you find actually in a pig brain,
where you have 100 billion neurons.
It has autonomous organized microcircuits,
has these programs which run.
It senses the food; it knows exactly what to do.
It senses it by chemical means
and very importantly by mechanical means,
because it has to move the food --
it has to mix all the various elements
which we need for digestion.
This control of muscle is very, very important,
because, you know, there can be reflexes.
it controls also the secretion of this molecular machinery,
which actually digests the food we cook.
I took here a model from robotics --
it's called the Subsumption Architecture.
The lower layer, our gut brain,
has its own goals -- digestion defense --
and we have the higher brain
with the goal of integration
and generating behaviors.
Now both look -- and this is the blue arrows --
both look to the same food, which is in the lumen
and in the area of your intestine.
The big brain integrates signals,
which come from the running programs
of the lower brain,
But subsumption means
that the higher brain can interfere with the lower.
It can replace,
or it can inhibit actually, signals.
So if we take two types of signals --
a hunger signal for example.
If you have an empty stomach,
it's sent to the brain says,
"Go and eat."
You have stop signals --
we have up to eight stop signals.
At least in my case,
they are not listened to.
(Laughter)
if the big brain in the integration
overrides the signal?
So if you override the hunger signal,
Despite generating
a healthy hunger signal,
the big brain ignores it
and activates different programs in the gut.
The more usual case
is overeating.
It actually takes the signal
and changes it,
We have transferred enough energy."
Now the interesting thing is that,
along this lower layer -- this gut --
the signal becomes stronger and stronger
if undigested, but digestible, material
could penetrate.
This we found from bariatric surgery.
That then the signal would be very, very high.
and back to the design.
We have learned to talk to the big brain --
taste and reward, as you know.
Now what would be the language
we have to talk to the gut brain
that its signals are so strong
that the big brain cannot ignore it?
Then we would generate something
all of us would like to have --
a balance between the hunger
and the satiation.
Now I give you, from our research, a very short claim.
This is fat digestion.
You have on your left
an olive oil droplet,
and this olive oil droplet gets attacked by enzymes.
This is an in vitro experiment.
It's very difficult to work in the intestine.
Now everyone would expect
that when the degradation of the oil happens,
when the constituents are liberated,
they disappear, they go away
because they [were] absorbed.
Actually, what happens is that a very intricate structure appears.
And I hope you can see
that there are some ring-like structures in the middle image,
which is water.
This whole system generates a huge surface
to allow more enzymes
to attack the remaining oil.
And finally, on your right side,
you see a bubbly,
cell-like structure appearing,
from which the body will absorb the fat.
Now if we could take this language --
and this is a language of structures --
and make it longer-lasting,
that it can go through
the passage of the intestine,
and I think the research also at the universities --
are now fixing on these points
to say: how can we actually --
and this might sound trivial now to you --
how can we change cooking?
How can we cook
that we have this language developed?
So what we have actually, it's not an omnivore's dilemma.
We have a coctivor's opportunity,
because we have learned over the last two million years
which taste and reward --
quite sophisticated to cook --
to please ourselves, to satisfy ourselves.
If we add the matrix,
if we add the structure language, which we have to learn,
when we learn it, then we can put it back;
and around energy,
we could generate a balance,
which comes out
from our really primordial operation: cooking.
So, to make cooking really
a very important element,
I would say even philosophers have to change
and have to finally recognize
that cooking is what made us.
I cook, therefore I am.
Thank you very much.
The stories we tell about each other
matter very much.
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter.
And most of all,
I think the way that we participate in each other's stories
is of deep importance.
I was six years old
when I first heard stories about the poor.
Now I didn't hear those stories from the poor themselves,
I heard them from my Sunday school teacher
and Jesus, kind of via my Sunday school teacher.
I remember learning that people who were poor
needed something material --
food, clothing, shelter -- that they didn't have.
And I also was taught, coupled with that,
that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children --
it was our job, apparently, to help.
This is what Jesus asked of us.
And then he said, "What you do for the least of these, you do for me."
Now I was pretty psyched.
I was very eager to be useful in the world --
I think we all have that feeling.
And also, it was kind of interesting that God needed help.
That was news to me,
and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in.
that Jesus also said, and I'm paraphrasing,
the poor would always be with us.
This frustrated and confused me;
I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment
that I had to do, and I was excited to do,
but no matter what I would do, I would fail.
So I felt confused, a little bit frustrated and angry,
like maybe I'd misunderstood something here.
And I felt overwhelmed.
And for the first time,
I began to fear this group of people
and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people.
I imagined in my head, a kind of long line of individuals
that were never going away, that would always be with us.
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things,
which I was excited to do,
but I didn't know how it was going to work.
And I didn't know what would happen when I ran out of things to give,
especially if the problem was never going away.
In the years following,
the other stories I heard about the poor growing up
were no more positive.
For example, I saw pictures and images
frequently of sadness and suffering.
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor.
I heard about disease, I heard about war --
they always seemed to be kind of related.
And in general,
I got this sort of idea
that the poor in the world lived lives
that were wrought with suffering and sadness,
devastation, hopelessness.
is this predictable response,
where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them.
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth,
because I wasn't doing more, apparently, to make things better.
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that.
And so naturally,
I started to distance myself.
I stopped listening to their stories
quite as closely as I had before.
And I stopped expecting things to really change.
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved.
I gave of my time and my money,
I gave when solutions were on sale.
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child's life, right.
I mean who can argue with that?
I gave when I was cornered, when it was difficult to avoid
and I gave, in general, when the negative emotions built up enough
that I gave to relieve my own suffering,
not someone else's.
The truth be told, I was giving out of that place,
not out of a genuine place of hope
and excitement to help and of generosity.
It became a transaction for me,
became sort of a trade.
I was purchasing something --
I was buying my right to go on with my day
and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news.
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes
can, first of all,
disembody a group of people, individuals out there in the world.
And it can also turn into a commodity,
which is a very scary thing.
So as I did this, and as I think many of us do this,
we kind of buy our distance,
we kind of buy our right to go on with our day.
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most.
It can get in the way of our desire
to really be meaningful and useful in another person's life
and, in short to love.
because I heard this gentleman speak, Dr. Muhammad Yunus.
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is,
but to give the shorthand version
for any who have not heard him speak,
Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago
for his work pioneering modern microfinance.
When I heard him speak, it was three years before that.
But basically, microfinance -- if this is new to you as well --
think of that as financial services for the poor.
Think of all the things you get at your bank
and imagine those products and services
tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day.
Dr. Yunus shared his story,
explaining what that was,
and what he had done with his Grameen Bank.
He also talked about, in particular, microlending,
which is a tiny loan
that could help someone start or grow a business.
Now, when I heard him speak, it was exciting for a number of reasons.
First and foremost, I learned about this new method of change in the world
that, for once, showed me, maybe,
a way to interact with someone
and to give, to share of a resource in a way that wasn't weird
and didn't make me feel bad --
that was exciting.
But more importantly, he told stories about the poor
that were different than any stories I had heard before.
In fact, those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note.
He was talking about strong, smart,
hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day
and were doing things to make their lives and their family's lives better.
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better
was a little bit of capital.
It was an amazing sort of insight for me.
it's hard to express now how much that affected me --
but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later,
and I moved to East Africa
to try to see for myself what this was about.
For the first time, actually, in a long time
I wanted to meet those individuals, I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs,
and see for myself what their lives were actually about.
So I spent three months in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania
interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars
to start or grow a business.
And in fact, through those interactions,
for the first time, I was starting to get to be friends
with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there
that was supposed to be far away.
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories.
And over and over again,
as I interviewed them and spent my days with them,
I did hear stories of life change
and amazing little details of change.
who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats.
Their business trajectory would change.
They would make a little bit more money;
their standard of living
would shift and would get better.
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives,
like they would start to send their children to school.
They might be able to buy mosquito nets.
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure.
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea
and offer that to me when I came as their guest
and that made them feel proud.
But there were these beautiful details, even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row,
and some days that's what happened --
these beautiful details of life change
that were meaningful to them.
That was another thing that really touched me.
It was really humbling to see for the first time,
to really understand
that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything,
I probably would have gotten a lot wrong.
Because the best way for people to change their lives
is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them.
So I saw that and it was very humbling.
I never once was asked for a donation,
which had kind of been my mode, right.
There's poverty, you give money to help --
no one asked me for a donation.
In fact, no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all.
If anything, they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already
and to build on their own capabilities.
So what I did hear, once in a while,
was that people wanted a loan --
I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting.
And by the way, I was a philosophy and poetry major in school,
so I didn't know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa.
I just got this impression that the money would work.
And my introduction to business
was in these $100 little infuses of capital.
And I learned about profit and revenue, about leverage, all sorts of things,
from farmers, from seamstresses, from goat herders.
So this idea
that these new stories of business and hope
might be shared with my friends and family,
and through that, maybe we could get some of the money that they needed
to be able to continue their businesses as loans,
that's this little idea that turned into Kiva.
with a digital camera and a basic website
that my partner, Matthew, and I had kind of built,
and took pictures of seven of my new friends,
posted their stories, these stories of entrepreneurship, up on the website,
spammed friends and family and said, "We think this is legal.
Haven't heard back yet from SEC on all the details,
but do you say, do you want to help participate in this,
provide the money that they need?"
The money came in basically overnight.
We sent it over to Uganda.
And over the next six months, a beautiful thing happened;
the entrepreneurs received the money,
they were paid, and their businesses, in fact, grew,
and they were able to support themselves
and change the trajectory of their lives.
In October of '05,
after those first seven loans were paid,
Matt and I took the word beta off of the site.
We said, "Our little experiment has been a success.
Let's start for real." That was our official launch.
And then that first year, October '05 through '06,
Kiva facilitated $500,000 in loans.
The second year, it was a total of 15 million.
The third year, the total was up to around 40.
The fourth year, we were just short of 100.
And today, less than five years in,
Kiva's facilitated
more than 150 million dollars, in little 25-dollar bits,
from lenders and entrepreneurs --
more than a million of those, collectively in 200 countries.
And while those numbers and those statistics
are really fun to talk about and they're interesting,
to me, Kiva's really about stories.
It's about retelling
the story of the poor,
and it's about giving ourselves
an opportunity to engage
that validates their dignity,
validates a partnership relationship,
not a relationship that's based
on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary
weirdness that can happen.
But instead a relationship that can promote respect
and hope
and this optimism
that together we can move forward.
So what I hope is that,
not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva --
that's a very positive and meaningful thing --
but I hope Kiva can blur those lines, like I said,
between the traditional rich and poor categories
that we're taught to see in the world,
this false dichotomy of us and them, have and have not.
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines.
Because as that happens,
I think we can feel free to interact
in a way that's more open, more just and more creative,
to engage with each other and to help each other.
when you see somebody on street who is begging
and you're about to approach them.
Imagine how you feel;
and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody
who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work
who wants to tell you about their business.
Maybe they're smiling, and they want to talk to you about what they've done.
Imagine if you're speaking with somebody
who's growing things and making them flourish,
somebody who's using their talents
to do something productive,
somebody who's built their own business from scratch,
someone who is surrounded by abundance,
not scarcity,
who's in fact creating abundance,
somebody with full hands with something to offer,
not empty hands
asking for you to give them something.
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn't expect
of somebody who wakes up every day
and works very, very hard to make their life better.
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other.
And if we can catalyze
a supportive community to come around these individuals
and to participate in their story
by lending a little bit of money,
I think that can change the way we believe in each other
and each other's potential.
And as I look forward to what is next,
it's been helpful to reflect on the things I've learned so far.
The first one is, as I mentioned, entrepreneurship was a new idea to me.
Kiva borrowers, as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years,
have taught me what entrepreneurship is.
And I think, at its core, it's deciding that you want your life to be better.
You see an opportunity
and you decide what you're going to do to try to seize that.
In short, it's deciding that tomorrow can better than today
and going after that.
Second thing that I've learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity.
So they're not a donation.
Yeah, maybe it doesn't sound that much different.
But in fact, when you give something to someone
and they say, "Thanks," and let you know how things go,
that's one thing.
When you lend them money, and they slowly pay you back over time,
you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue.
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention --
is a really big deal
to build different kinds of relationships among us.
And then third, from what I've heard from the entrepreneurs I've gotten to know,
when all else is equal,
given the option to have just money to do what you need to do,
or money plus the support and encouragement
of a global community,
people choose the community plus the money.
That's a much more meaningful combination, a more powerful combination.
has led to the things that I'm working on now.
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now, now that I'm tuned into this.
And one thing that I've seen
is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world.
With social networks,
it's an amazing way, growing the number of people that we all have around us
in our own supportive communities, rapidly.
And so, as I have been thinking about this,
I've been wondering: how can we engage these supportive communities
to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas
and to catalyze all of us
to make tomorrow better than today?
As I've researched what's going on in the United States,
a few interesting little insights have come up.
So one is that, of course, as we all might expect,
many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world
still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do
or they might need money during a hard month.
But there's always a need for resources close by.
Another thing is, it turns out,
those resources don't usually come from the places you might expect --
banks, venture capitalists,
other organizations and support structures --
they come from friends and family.
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses
comes from friends and family.
That's around 130 billion dollars a year --
it's a lot.
And third, so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process,
it's very awkward, people don't know exactly what to ask for,
how to ask, what to promise in return,
even though they have the best of intentions
and want to thank those people that are supporting them.
and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves
exactly what that financial exchange should look like,
exactly what fits them and the people around them,
this week actually,
we're quietly doing a launch of Profounder,
which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need
through investments from their friends and family.
And it's investments, not donations, not loans,
but investments that have a dynamic return.
So the mapping of participating in the story,
it actually flows with the up and down.
So in short, it's a do-it-yourself tool
for small businesses to raise these funds.
And what you can do is go onto the site, create a profile,
create investment terms in a really easy way.
We make it really, really simple for me
as well as anyone else who wants to use the site.
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues.
They can raise up to a million dollars
from an unlimited number of unaccredited, unsophisticated investors --
everyday people, heaven forbid --
and they can share those returns over time --
again, whatever terms they set.
As investors choose to become involved
based on those terms,
they can either take their rewards back as cash,
or they can decide in advance
to give those returns away to a non-profit.
So they can be a cash, or a cause, investor.
It's my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea
a path to go do what they want to do in the world
and to gather the people around them that they already have,
the people that know them best
and that love them and want to support them,
to gather them to make this happen.
And to close, I just want to say, look these are tools.
Right now, Profounder's right at the very beginning,
and it's very palpable; it's very clear to me, that it's just a vessel, it's just a tool.
What we need are for people to care, to actually go use it,
just like they've cared enough to use Kiva
to make those connections.
But the good news is I don't think I need to stand here and convince you to care --
I'm not even going to try.
I don't think, even though we often hear,
you know, hear the ethical and moral reasons,
the religious reasons,
"Here's why caring and giving will make you happier."
I don't think we need to be convinced of that. I think we know;
in fact, I think we know so much,
and it's such a reality
that we care so deeply,
that in fact, what usually stops us
is that we're afraid to try and to mess up,
because we care so very much about helping each other
and being meaningful in each other's lives.
that best thing I can give you --
I've given you my story, which is the best I can do.
And I think I can remind us that we do care.
I think we all already know that.
And I think we know that love is resilient enough
for us to get out there and try.
Just a sec.
is to stop and to listen
to someone else's story.
And I'm grateful that I've gotten to do that here at TED.
And I'm grateful that whenever I do that,
guaranteed, I am inspired --
I am inspired by the person I am listening to.
And I believe more and more every time I listen
in that that person's potential to do great things in the world
and in my own potential to maybe help.
And that --
forget the tools, forget the moving around of resources --
that stuff's easy.
Believing in each other,
really being sure when push comes to shove
that each one of us can do amazing things in the world,
that is what can make our stories into love stories
and our collective story
into one that continually perpetuates hope
and good things for all of us.
So that, this belief in each other,
knowing that without a doubt
and practicing that every day in whatever you do,
that's what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today.
Every presentation needs this slide in it.
(Laughter)
It's beautiful, isn't it?
Do you see?
All the points, all the lines --
it's incredible.
It is the network;
and in my case, the network has been important in media,
because I get to connect to people.
Isn't it amazing?
Through that, I connect to people.
And the way that I've been doing it
has been multifaceted.
For example, I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners.
(Laughter)
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich,
where I ask people
to try and simultaneously place
two pieces of bread
perfectly opposite each other on the Earth.
And people started laying bread in tribute,
and eventually a team was able to do it
between New Zealand and Spain.
It's pretty incredible -- the video's online.
Connecting to people in projects
like YoungmeNowme for example.
In YoungmeNowme, the audience was asked
to find a childhood photograph of themselves
and restage it as an adult.
(Laughter)
This is the same person --
top photo, James, bottom photo, [Jennifer].
Poignant.
This was a Mother's Day gift.
(Laughter)
Particularly creepy.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
My favorite of these photos, which I couldn't find,
is there's a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so
with a little baby on her lap,
and the next photo is a 220-lb man
with a tiny, little old lady peaking over his shoulder.
that I thought about connecting to people.
This is project called Ray.
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio
and had no idea who generated the audio.
Somebody said, "You have to listen to this."
And this is what came to me.
and on yesterday my daughter called me
because she was stressed out
because of things that were going on on her job
that she felt was quite unfair.
Being quite disturbed, she called for comfort,
and I didn't really know what to tell her,
because we have to deal with so much mess in our society.
So I was led to write this song just for her,
just to give her some encouragement
while dealing with stress and pressures on her job.
And I figured I'd put it on the Internet
for all employees under stress
to help you better deal with what you're going through on your job.
Here's how the song goes.
but you can hum it to yourself, and you know what the words are.
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job.
All right. Stay strong. Peace.
No, no, no, shush. We've got to go quickly.
So I was so moved by this --
this is incredible. This was connecting, right.
This was, at a distance,
realizing that someone was feeling something,
wanting to affect them in a particular way,
using media to do it, putting it online
and realizing that there was a greater impact.
This was incredible; this is what I wanted to do.
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him.
And I asked my audience, I said, "Listen to this piece of audio.
We have to remix it. He's got a great voice.
It's actually in the key of B flat.
And have to do something with it."
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts.
One stood out in particular.
It was done by a guy named Goose.
That song -- (Applause) Thank you.
So that song, somebody told me that it was at a baseball game
in Kansas City.
In the end,
it was one of the top downloads
on a whole bunch of music streaming services.
And so I said, "Let's put this together in an album."
And the audience came together, and they designed an album cover.
And I said, "If you put it all on this, I'm going to deliver it to him,
if you can figure out who this person is,"
because all I had was his name -- Ray --
and this little piece of audio
and the fact that his daughter was upset.
In two weeks, they found him.
I received and email and it said,
"Hi, I'm Ray.
I heard you were looking for me."
(Laughter)
And I was like, "Yeah, Ray.
It's been an interesting two weeks."
And so I flew to St. Louis
and met Ray,
and he's a preacher --
(Laughter)
among other things.
is it reminds me of this,
which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner.
And it's sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world.
I look at this photo, and he seems really interested
in what's going on with that button,
but it doesn't seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street.
(Laughter)
And it makes me think of this.
On street corners everywhere, people are looking at their cell phones,
and it's easy to dismiss this
as some sort of bad trend
in human culture.
But the truth is
life is being lived there.
When they smile --
right, you've seen people stop --
all of a sudden, life is being lived there,
somewhere up in that weird, dense network.
And this is it, right, to feel and be felt.
It's the fundamental force
that we're all after.
We can build all sorts of environments
to make it a little bit easier,
but ultimately, what we're trying to do
is really connect with one other person.
And that's not always going to happen in physical spaces.
It's also going to now happen in virtual spaces,
and we have to get better at figuring that out.
I think, of the people that build all this technology in the network,
a lot of them aren't very good
at connecting with people.
This is kind of like something I used to do
in third grade.
over the last few years
where I've been inspired by trying to figure out
how to really facilitate close connection.
Sometimes they're very, very simple things.
A Childhood Walk, which is a project
where I ask people to remember a walk
that they used to take as a child over and over again
that was sort of meaningless --
like on the route to the bus stop, to a neighbor's house,
and take it inside of Google Streetview.
And I promise you,
if you take that walk inside Google Streetview,
you come to a moment
where something comes back
and hits you in the face.
And I collected those moments --
the photos inside Google Streetview
and the memories, specifically.
"Our conversation started with me saying, 'I'm bored,'
and her replying, 'When I'm bored I eat pretzels.'
I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot."
"Right after he told me and my brother
he was going to be separating from my mom,
I remember walking to a convenience store
and getting a cherry cola."
"They used some of the morbidly artist footage,
a close-up of Chad's shoes in the middle of the highway.
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit.
He slept over at my house once, and he left his pillow.
It had 'Chad' written in magic marker on it.
He died long after he left the pillow at my house,
but we never got around to returning it."
This is Pain Pack.
Right after September 11th, last year,
I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it,
the way that we excise it from our bodies.
So what I did is I opened up a hotline --
a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain,
not necessarily related to that event.
And people called in and left messages like this.
I'm not alone,
and I am loved.
I'm really fortunate.
But sometimes I feel really lonely.
And when I feel that way
even the smallest act of kindness
can make me cry.
Like even people in convenience stores
saying, "Have a nice day,"
when they're accidentally looking me in the eye.
and with their permission, converted them to MP3s
and distributed them to sound editors
who created short sounds
using just those voicemails.
And those were then distributed to DJs
who have made hundreds of songs
using that source material.
(Music)
We don't have time to play much of it.
You can look at it online.
was a project around the time of the last election cycle,
where McCain and Obama both,
in their speeches after the election, talked about reconciliation,
and I was like, "What the hell
does that look like?"
So I thought, "Well let's just give it a try.
Let's have people hold up signs about reconciliation."
And so some really nice things came together.
"I voted blue. I voted red.
Together, for our future."
These are very, very cute little things right.
Some came from the winning party.
"Dear 48, I promise to listen to you, to fight for you, to respect you always."
Some came from the party who had just lost.
"From a 48 to a 52, may your party's leadership be as classy as you,
but I doubt it."
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular,
a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards
apparently found it to be a little patronizing,
which I could also see.
And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail,
death threats even.
And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages,
and he was dressed as Batman.
And he said, "I'm dressed as Batman to hide my identity."
Just in case I thought the real Batman
was coming after me;
which actually made me feel a little better --
like, "Phew, it's not him."
unfortunately, I was harboring all this kind of
awful experience and this pain inside of me,
and it started to eat away at my psyche.
And I was protecting the project from it, I realized. I was protecting it --
I didn't want this special, little group of photographs
to get sullied in some way.
So what I did, I took all those emails,
and I put them together into something called Angrigami,
which was an origami template
made out of this sort of vile stuff.
And I asked people to send me beautiful things
made out of the Angrigami.
(Laughter)
But this was the emotional moment.
One of my viewer's uncles died on a particular day
and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate.
It's amazing.
called Songs You Already Know,
where the idea was,
I was trying to figure out to address
particular kinds of emotions with group projects.
So one of them was fairly straightforward.
A guy said that his daughter got scared at night
and could I write a song for her, his daughter.
And I said, "Oh yeah,
I'll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself
to help herself go to sleep."
And this was "Scared."
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter's room at some point,
and she actually was singing that song to herself.
So I was like, "Awesome. This is great."
And I don't have much time.
But the idea was that at one point
I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You,
where I wanted to experience what it was like
to live as another person.
So I asked for people's usernames and passwords to be sent to me.
And I got a lot, like 30 in a half an hour.
And I shut that part down.
And I chose two people to be,
and I asked them to send me descriptions
of how to act as them on Facebook.
One person sent me a very detailed description;
the other person didn't.
And the person who didn't, it turned out,
had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job.
So, you know, people were writing me and saying, "How's your new job?"
I was like, "I don't know.
Didn't know I had one."
ended up emailing me a little bit after that project.
And I felt badly for not having done a good job.
And she said, "I'm really anxious, I just moved to a new town, I have this new job,
and I've just had this incredible amount of anxiety."
So she had seen the "Scared" song and wondered if I could do something.
So I asked her, "What does it feel like when you feel this way?"
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set
of what it felt like to have had this anxiety.
And so what I decided to do.
I said, "Okay, I'll think about it."
And so quietly in the background, I started sending people this.
whether they had basic audio capabilities,
just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on,
so I could just get their voices back.
And this is the kind of thing that I got back.
But what's awesome is, as I started getting more and more and more of them,
all of a sudden I had 30, 40 voices from around the world.
And when you put them together, something magical happens,
something absolutely incredible happens,
and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world.
And what was really great is, I'm putting all this work together in the background,
and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by.
And she said, "I know you've forgotten about me.
I just want to say thanks for even considering it."
And then a few days later I sent her this.
I am the daughter of a forger,
not just any forger ...
When you hear the word "forger," you often understand "mercenary."
You understand "forged currency," "forged pictures."
My father is no such man.
For 30 years of his life,
he made false papers --
never for himself, always for other people,
and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed.
Let me introduce him.
Here is my father at age 19.
It all began for him during World War II,
when at age 17 he found himself thrust
into a forged documents workshop.
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance.
And it's not a banal story --
after the liberation he continued
to make false papers until the '70s.
I knew nothing about this, of course.
This is me in the middle making faces.
I grew up in the Paris suburbs
and I was the youngest of three children.
I had a "normal" dad like everybody else,
apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...
well, he was basically old enough to be my grandfather.
Anyway, he was a photographer and a street educator,
and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly.
And, of course, he never talked about his past life
when he was a forger.
that perhaps could have led me suspect something.
I was in high school and got a bad grade,
a rare event for me,
so I decided to hide it from my parents.
In order to do that, I set out to forge their signature.
I started working on my mother's signature,
because my father's is absolutely impossible to forge.
So, I got working. I took some sheets of paper
and started practicing, practicing, practicing,
until I reached what I thought was a steady hand,
and went into action.
Later, while checking my school bag,
my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged.
She yelled at me like she never had before.
I went to hide in my bedroom, under the blankets,
and then I waited for my father to come back from work
with, one could say, much apprehension.
I heard him come in.
I remained under the blankets. He entered my room,
sat on the corner of the bed,
and he was silent, so I pulled the blanket from my head,
and when he saw me he started laughing.
He was laughing so hard, he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand.
Then he said, "But really, Sarah, you could have worked harder! Can't you see it's really too small?"
Indeed, it's rather small.
There I would hear people say my father was a "moudjahid"
and that means "fighter."
Later on, in France, I loved eavesdropping on grownups' conversations,
and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father's previous life,
especially that he had "done" World War II,
that he had "done" the Algerian war.
And in my head I would be thinking that "doing" a war meant being a soldier.
But knowing my father, and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent,
I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun.
And indeed, I was very far from the mark.
for us to obtain French nationality,
I happened to see some documents
that caught my attention.
These are real!
These are mine, I was born an Argentinean.
But the document I happened to see
that would help us build a case for the authorities
was a document from the army
that thanked my father for his work
on behalf of the secret services.
And then, suddenly, I went "wow!"
My father, a secret agent?
It was very James Bond.
I wanted to ask him questions, which he didn't answer.
And later, I told myself that
one day I would have to question him.
And then I became a mother and had a son,
and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us.
I had become a mother
and he was celebrating his 77th birthday,
and suddenly I was very, very afraid.
I feared he'd go
and take his silences with him,
and take his secrets with him.
I managed to convince him that it was important for us,
but possibly also for other people
that he shared his story.
He decided to tell it to me
and I made a book,
from which I'm going to read you some excerpts later.
His parents were of Russian descent.
The whole family came to settle in France in the '30s.
His parents were Jewish, Russian and above all, very poor.
So at the age of 14 my father had to work.
And with his only diploma,
his primary education certificate,
he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner.
That's where he discovered something totally magical,
and when he talks about it, it's fascinating --
it's the magic of dyeing chemistry.
During that time the war was happening
and his mother was killed when he was 15.
This coincided with the time when
he threw himself body and soul into chemistry
because it was the only consolation for his sadness.
All day he would ask many questions to his boss
to learn, to accumulate more and more knowledge,
and at night, when no one was looking,
he'd put his experience to practice.
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching.
that if my father became a forger, actually,
it was almost by accident.
His family was Jewish, so they were hounded.
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp
and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers.
Well, they were out,
but they were always in danger. The big "Jew" stamp was still on their papers.
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents.
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law
that although he was being persecuted,
he'd never thought of false papers.
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance.
they were filled in by hand,
and they stated your job.
In order to survive, he needed
to be working. He asked the man
to write "dyer."
Suddenly the man looked very, very interested.
As a "dyer," do you know how to bleach ink marks?
Of course he knew.
And suddenly the man started explaining that
actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem:
even the top experts
could not manage to bleach an ink, called "indelible,"
the "Waterman" blue ink.
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly
how to bleach it.
Now, of course, the man was very impressed with this young man of 17
who could immediately give him the formula, so he recruited him.
And actually, without knowing it, my father had invented something
we can find in every schoolchild's pencil case:
the so-called "correction pen."
(Applause)
That's my father.
As soon as he got to the lab,
even though he was the youngest,
he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents.
All the movements stopped at falsifying.
But demand was ever-growing
and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents.
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch.
He started a press. He started photoengraving.
He started making rubber stamps.
He started inventing all kind of things --
with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel.
Anyway, he had to do all this
because he was completely obsessed with output.
He had made a simple calculation:
In one hour he could make 30 forged documents.
If he slept one hour, 30 people would die.
responsibility for other people's lives when he was just 17 --
and also his guilt for being a survivor,
since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not --
stayed with him all his life.
And this is maybe what explains why, for 30 years,
he continued to make false papers
at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices.
I'd like to talk about those sacrifices,
because there were many.
There were obviously financial sacrifices
because he always refused to be paid.
To him, being paid would have meant being a mercenary.
If he had accepted payment,
he wouldn't be able to say "yes" or "no"
depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause.
So he was a photographer by day,
and a forger by night for 30 years.
He was broke all of the time.
How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets?
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab, every single night?
Of course, there was another kind of sacrifice
involving his family that I understood much later.
One day my father introduced me to my sister.
He also explained to me that I had a brother, too,
and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four,
and they were 30 years older than me.
They are both in their sixties now.
I asked my sister questions. I wanted to know who my father was,
who was the father she had known.
She explained that the father that she'd had
would tell them he'd come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk.
They would get all dressed up and wait for him,
but he would almost never come.
He'd say, "I'll call." He wouldn't call.
And then he would not come.
Then one day he totally disappeared.
Time passed,
and they thought he had surely forgotten them,
at first.
Then as time passed,
at the end of almost two years, they thought,
"Well, perhaps our father has died."
And then I understood
that asking my father so many questions
was stirring up a whole past he probably didn't feel like talking about
because it was painful.
And while my half brother and sister thought they'd been abandoned,
orphaned,
my father was making false papers.
And if he did not tell them, it was of course to protect them.
to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine
before the creation of Israel.
And then, as he was a staunch anti-colonialist,
he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war.
After the Algerian war,
at the heart of the international resistance movements,
his name circulated
and the whole world came knocking at his door.
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence:
Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Angola.
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela's anti-apartheid party.
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans.
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships
in the Dominican Republic, Haiti,
and then it was the turn of Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, El Salvador, Nicaragua,
Colombia, Peru, Uruguay, Chile and Mexico.
Then there was the Vietnam War.
My father made false papers for the American deserters
who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese.
Europe was not spared either.
My father made false papers for the dissidents
against Franco in Spain, Salazar in Portugal,
against the colonels' dictatorship in Greece,
and even in France.
There, just once, it happened in May of 1968.
My father watched, benevolently, of course,
the demonstrations of the month of May,
but his heart was elsewhere, and so was his time
because he had over 15 countries to serve.
for someone you might recognize.
(Laughter)
He was much younger in those days,
and my father agreed to make false papers
to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting.
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant
and the least useful he'd had to make in all his life.
But, he agreed to do it,
even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit's life was not in danger,
just because
it was a good opportunity
to mock the authorities,
and to show them that there's nothing more porous than borders --
and that ideas have no borders.
while my friends' dads would tell them Grimm's fairy tales,
my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes
with unshakeable utopias
who managed to make miracles.
And those heroes did not need an army behind them.
Anyhow, nobody would have followed them,
except for a handful [of] men and women of conviction and courage.
I understood much later
that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep.
I asked him whether, considering the sacrifices he had to make,
he ever had any regrets.
He said no.
He told me that he would have been unable
to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything.
He was persuaded, and he's still convinced
that another world is possible --
a world where no one would ever need a forger.
He's still dreaming about it.
My father
is here in the room today.
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I'm going to ask him to stand up.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I was informed by this kind of
unoriginal and trite idea
that new technologies were an opportunity
for social transformation,
which is what drove me then,
and still, it's a delusion that drives me now.
I wanted to update what I've been doing since then --
but it's still the same theme song --
and introduce you to my lab and current work,
which is the Environmental Health Clinic
that I run at NYU.
And what it is -- it's a twist on health.
Because, really, what I'm trying to do now
is redefine what counts as health.
It's a clinic like a health clinic at any other university,
except people come to the clinic
with environmental health concerns,
and they walk out with prescriptions
for things they can do to improve environmental health,
as opposed to coming to a clinic with medical concerns
and walking out with prescriptions for pharmaceuticals.
that says, "The greater part of the soul lays outside the body,
treatment of the inner requires treatment of the outer."
But that suggests the issue
that I'm trying to get at here,
that we have an opportunity to redefine what is health.
Because this idea that health is internal
and atomized and individual
and pharmaceutical
is largely an error.
And I would use this study,
a recent study by Philip Landrigan,
to motivate a different view of health,
where he went to most of the pediatricians in Manhattan
and the New York area
and logged what they spent their patient hours on.
80 to 90 percent of their time
was spent on five things.
Number one was asthma,
number two was developmental delays,
number three was 400-fold increases
in rare childhood cancers
in the last eight to 10, 15 years.
Number four and five were childhood obesity
and diabetes-related issues.
So all of those -- what's common about all of those?
The environment is implicated, radically implicated, right.
This is not the germs
that medicos were trained to deal with;
this is a different definition of health,
health that has a great advantage
because it's external, it's shared,
we can do something about it,
as opposed to internal, genetically predetermined
or individualized.
but impatients,
because they're too impatient to wait for legislative change
to address local and environmental health issues.
And I meet them at the University, I also have a few field offices
that I set up in various places
that provide an immersion
in some of the environmental challenges we face.
I like this one from the Belgian field office,
where we met in a roundabout,
precisely because the roundabout iconified
the headless social movement
that informs much social transformation,
as opposed to the top-down control
of red light traffic intersections.
In this case, of course, the roundabout
with that micro-decisions being made in situ
by people not being told what to do.
But, of course, affords greater throughput,
fewer accidents,
and an interesting model of social movement.
this is the tadpole bureaucrat protocol,
or keeping tabs, if you will.
What they are is an addition of tadpoles
that are named after a local bureaucrat
whose decisions affect your water quality.
So an impatient concerned for water quality
would raise a tadpole bureaucrat
in a sample of water in which they're interested.
And we give them a couple of things to do that,
to help them do companion animal devices
while they're blogging and doing their email.
This is a tadpole walker
to take your tadpole walking in the evening.
And the interesting thing that happens --
because we're using tadpoles, of course,
because they have the most exquisite biosenses that we have,
several orders of magnitude more sensitive
than some of our senses
for sensing,
responding in a biologically meaningful way,
to that whole class of industrial contaminants
we call endocrine disruptors
or hormone emulators.
there's a few action shots --
your neighbors are likely to say, "What are you doing?"
And then you have to introduce your tadpole
and who it's named after.
You have to explain what you're doing
and how the developmental events of a tadpole
are, of course, very observable
and they use the same T3-mediated hormones that we do.
And so next time your neighbor sees you
they'll say, "How is that tadpole doing?"
And you can let them social network with your tadpole,
because the Environmental Health Clinic has a social networking site
for, not only impatients, humans,
but non-humans,
social networking for humans and non-humans.
And of course, these endocrine disruptors
are things that are implicated in the breast cancer epidemic,
the obesity epidemic,
the two and a half year drop in the average age of onset of puberty in young girls
and other related things.
The culmination of this is if you've successfully raised your tadpole,
observing the behavioral
and developmental events,
you will then go and introduce your tadpole
to its namesake
and discuss the evidence that you've seen.
but just to give you the material sense of what we're doing here --
instead of asking you for urine samples,
I'll ask you for a mouse sample.
Anyone here lucky enough to share, to cohabit with a mouse --
a domestic partnership with mice?
Very lucky.
Mice, of course, are the quintessential
model organism.
They're even better models of environmental health,
because not only the same mammalian biology,
but they share your diet, largely.
They share your environmental stressors,
the asbestos levels and lead levels,
whatever you're exposed to.
And they're geographically more limited than you are,
because we don't know if you've been exposed
to persistent organic pollutants
in your home, or occupationally
or as a child.
Mice are a very good representation.
So it starts by building a better mousetrap, of course.
This is one of them.
Is anybody here on antidepressants?
(Laughter)
There's a lot of people in Manhattan are.
And we were testing if the mice
would also self-administer SSRIs.
So this was Prozac, this was Zoloft,
this was a black jellybean and this was muscle relaxant,
all of which were the medications that the impatient was taking.
So do you think the mice
self-administered antidepressants?
What's the -- (Audience: Sure. Yes.)
How did you know that? They did.
This was vodka and solution, gin and solution.
This guy also liked plain water and the muscle relaxant.
Where's our expert?
Vodka, gin --
(Audience: [unclear])
Yes. Yes. You know your mice well.
They did, yes.
So they drank as much vodka as they did plain water,
which was interesting.
Then of course, it goes into the entrapment device.
There's an old cellphone in there -- a good use for old cellphones --
which dials the clinic, we go and pick up the mouse.
We take the blood sample
and do the blood work and hair work on the mice.
of framing health in this external way.
But we do have a few prescription products through this.
It's very different from the medical model.
Anything you do to improve your water quality or air quality,
or to understand it or to change it,
the benefits are enjoyed by anyone
you share that water quality or air quality with.
And that aggregating effect,
that collective action effect,
is actually something we can use to our advantage.
So I want to show you one prescription product in the clinic
called the No Park.
This is a prescription to improve water quality.
Many impatients are very concerned for water quality and air quality.
What we do is we take a fire hydrant,
a "no parking" space associated with a fire hydrant,
and we prescribe the removal of the asphalt
to create an engineered micro landscape,
to create an infiltration opportunity.
that the biggest pollution burden
that we have on the New York, New Jersey harbor right now
is no longer the point sources,
no longer the big polluters,
no longer the GEs,
but that massive network of roads,
[those] impervious surfaces,
that collect all that cadmium neurotoxin that comes from your brake liners
or the oily hydrocarbon waste
in every single storm event and medieval infrastructure
washes it straight into the estuary system.
That doesn't do a lot of good.
These are little opportunities to intercept those pollutants
before they enter the harbor,
and they're produced by impatients
on various city blocks
in some very interesting ways.
I just want to say it was sort of a rule of thumb though,
there's about two or three fire hydrants
on every city block.
By creating engineered micro landscapes to infiltrate in them,
we don't prevent them from being used
as emergency vehicle parking spaces,
because, of course, a firetruck can come and park there.
They flatten a few plants. No big deal, they'll regenerate.
But if we did this
in every single --
every fire hydrant
we could redefine the emergency.
That 99 percent of the time
when a firetruck is not parking there,
it's infiltrating pollutants.
It's also increasing fixing CO2s,
sequestering some of the airborne pollutants.
And aggregated,
these smaller interceptions
could actually infiltrate all the roadborne pollution
that now runs into the estuary system,
up to a seven inch rain event, up to a hundred-year storm.
that can amount to a significant effect
to improve local environmental health.
This is one of the more ambitious ones.
What the climate crisis has revealed to us
is a secondary, more insidious
and more pervasive crisis,
which is the crisis of agency,
which is what to do.
Somehow buying a local lettuce, changing a light bulb,
driving the speed limit, changing your tires regularly,
doesn't seem sufficient
in the face of climate crisis.
And this is an interesting icon that happened --
you remember these: fallout shelters.
What is the fallout shelter
for the climate crisis?
This was civic mobilization.
Churches, school groups,
hospitals, private residents --
everyone built one of these in a matter of months.
And they still remain
as icons of civic response
in the face of shared, uncertain, collective threat.
I would say, looks something like this, or this,
which is an intensive urban agriculture facility
that's due to go on my lab building at NYU.
What it does
is a very simple idea
of taking --
80 to 90 percent of the CO2 produced in Manhattan
is building related --
we take, just like a commercial greenhouse,
we take the CO2 from the building --
CO2-enriched air --
we force it through the urban agriculture facility,
and then we resupply oxygen-enriched air.
You can't actually build much on a roof, they're not designed for that.
So it's on legs,
so it focuses all the load on the masonry walls and the columns.
It's built as a barn raising,
using open source hardware.
This is the quarter-scale prototype
that was functioning in Spain.
This is what it will look like, fingers crossed,
NYU willing.
actually this is one of the components of it that we've just recently been testing --
which is a solar chimney --
we have got 17 of them now put around New York at the moment --
that passively draws air up.
You understand a solar chimney.
Hot air rises.
You put a bit of black plastic on the side of a building,
it'll heat up, and you'll get passive airflow.
What we do is actually
put a standard HVAC filter on the top of that.
That actually removes about 95 percent
of the carbon black,
that stuff that, with ozone,
is responsible for about half of global warming's effects,
because it changes, it settles on the snow,
it changes the reflectors,
it changes
the transmission qualities of the atmosphere.
Carbon black is that grime
that otherwise lodges in your pretty pink lungs,
and it's associated with.
It's not good stuff, and it's from inefficient combustion,
not from combustion itself.
When we put it through our solar chimney,
we remove actually about 95 percent of that.
And then I swap it out
with the students
and actually re-release that carbon black.
And we make pencils the length of which measures the grime
that we've pulled out of the air.
Here's one of them that we have up now.
Here's who put them up and who are avid pencil users.
just two more interfaces,
because I think one of our big challenges
is re-imagining our relationship to natural systems,
not only through this model
of twisted personalized health,
but through the animals
with whom we cohabit.
We are not alone; the animals are moving in.
In fact, urban migration now describes
the movement of animals formerly known as wild
into urban centers.
You know, coyote in Central Park, a whale in the Gowanus Canal,
elk in Westchester County.
It's happening all over the Developed World,
probably for loss of habitat,
but also because our cities are a little bit more livable
than they have been.
And every green space we create
is an invitation for non-humans to cohabit with us.
But we've kind of lacked imagination
in how we could do that well or interestingly.
And I want to show you a few of the technological interfaces
that have been developed under the moniker of OOZ --
which is zoo backwards and without cages --
to try and reform
that relationship.
This is communication technology for birds. It looks like this.
When a bird lands on it, they trigger a sound file.
This is actually in the Whitney Museum, where there were six of them,
each of which had a different argument on it,
different sound file.
They said things like this.
Go down there and buy some of those health food bars,
the ones you call bird food,
and bring it here and scatter it around.
There's a good person.
So there was several of these.
The birds were able to jump from one to the other.
These are just your average urban pigeon.
And an early test
which argument elicited cooperative behavior
from the people below --
about a hundred to one
decided that this was the argument
that worked best on us.
That's the sound of genetic mutations
of the avian flu
becoming a deadly human flu.
Do you know what slows it down?
Healthy sub-populations of birds,
increasing biodiversity generally.
It is in your interests that I'm healthy,
happy, well-fed.
Hence, you could share some of your nutritional resources
instead of monopolizing them.
That is, share your lunch.
The final project I'd like to show you
is a new interface for fish
that has just been launched --
it's actually officially launched next week --
with a wonderful commission from the Architectural League.
You may not have known that you need to communicate with fish,
but there is now a device for you to do so.
It looks like this: buoys that float on the water,
project three foot up, three foot down.
When a fish swims underneath, a light goes on.
This is what it looks like.
So there's another function on here.
This top light is -- I'm sorry if I'm making you seasick --
this top light is actually a water quality display
that shifts from red, when the dissolved oxygen is low,
to a blue/green, when its dissolved oxygen is high.
And then you can also text the fish.
So there's business cards down there
that'll give you contact details.
And they text back.
When the buoys get your text, they wink at you twice to say, we've got your message.
But perhaps the most popular has been
that we've got another array of these boys in the Bronx River,
where the first beaver --
crazy as he is --
to have moved in and built a lodge in New York
in 250 years, hangs out.
So updates from a beaver.
You can subscribe to updates from him. You can talk to him.
is this is an interface
that re-scripts how we interact with natural systems,
specifically by changing who has information,
where they have it,
who can make sense of that information,
and what you can do about it.
In this case, instead of throwing chewing gum,
or Doritos or whatever you have in your pocket at the fish --
There's a body of water in Iceland that I've been dealing with
that's in the middle of the city,
and the largest pollution burden on it
is not the roadborne pollution,
it's actually white bread
from people feeding the fish and the birds.
Instead of doing that actually, we've developed some fish sticks
that you can feed the fish.
They're delicious.
They're cross-species delicious that is,
delicious for humans and non-humans.
But they also have a chelating agent in them.
They're nutritionally appropriate,
not like Doritos.
And so every time
that desire to interact with the animals,
which is at least as ubiquitous
as that sign: "Do not feed the animals."
And there's about three of them on every New York City park.
And Yellowstone National Park,
there's more "do not feed the animals" signs
than there are animals you might wish to feed.
But in that action, that interaction,
by re-scripting that,
by changing it into an opportunity
to offer food that is nutritionally appropriate,
that could augment the nutritional resources
that we ourselves have depleted
for augmenting the fish population
and also adding chelating agent,
which, like any chelating agent that we use medicinally,
binds to the bioaccumulated heavy metals and PCBs
that are in the fish
living in this particular habitat
and allows them to pass it out as a harmless salt
where it's complexed by a reactive,
effectively removing it from bioavailability.
re-scripting that interaction,
into collective action, collective remediative action,
very different from the approach
that's being used on the other side on the Hudson River,
where we're dredging the PCBs --
after 30 years of legislative and legal struggle,
GE's paying for the dredging
of the largest Superfund site in the world --
we're dredging it, and it'll probably get shipped off to Pennsylvania
or the nearest Third World country,
where it will continue to be toxic sludge.
Displacement is not the way to deal with environmental issues.
And that's typically the paradigm
under which we've operated.
that new technologies,
new interactive technologies, present
to re-script our interactions,
to script them,
not just as isolated, individuated interactions,
but as collective aggregating actions
that can amount to something,
we can really begin to address
some of our important environmental challenges.
One of my favorite parts
of my job at the Gates Foundation
is that I get to travel to the developing world,
and I do that quite regularly.
And when I meet the mothers
in so many of these remote places,
I'm really struck by the things
that we have in common.
They want what we want for our children
and that is for their children to grow up successful,
to be healthy, and to have a successful life.
But I also see lots of poverty,
and it's quite jarring,
both in the scale and the scope of it.
My first trip in India, I was in a person's home
where they had dirt floors, no running water,
no electricity,
and that's really what I see all over the world.
So in short, I'm startled by all the things
that they don't have.
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have:
Coca-Cola.
In fact, when I travel to the developing world,
Coke feels ubiquitous.
And so when I come back from these trips,
and I'm thinking about development,
and I'm flying home and I'm thinking,
"We're trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations,"
you know, Coke's success kind of stops and makes you wonder:
how is it that they can get Coke
to these far-flung places?
If they can do that,
why can't governments and NGOs do the same thing?
And I'm not the first person to ask this question.
But I think, as a community,
we still have a lot to learn.
It's staggering, if you think about Coca-Cola.
They sell 1.5 billion servings
every single day.
That's like every man, woman and child on the planet
having a serving of Coke every week.
So why does this matter?
Well, if we're going to speed up the progress
and go even faster
on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we're set as a world,
we need to learn from the innovators,
and those innovators
come from every single sector.
I feel that, if we can understand
what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous,
we can apply those lessons then for the public good.
because if we can analyze it, learn from it,
then we can save lives.
So that's why I took a bit of time to study Coke.
And I think there are really three things
we can take away from Coca-Cola.
They take real-time data
and immediately feed it back into the product.
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent,
and they do incredible marketing.
So let's start with the data.
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line --
they report to a set of shareholders, they have to turn a profit.
So they take the data,
and they use it to measure progress.
They have this very continuous feedback loop.
They learn something, they put it back into the product,
they put it back into the market.
They have a whole team called "Knowledge and Insight."
It's a lot like other consumer companies.
So if you're running Namibia for Coca-Cola,
and you have a 107 constituencies,
you know where every can versus bottle
of Sprite, Fanta or Coke was sold,
whether it was a corner store,
a supermarket or a pushcart.
So if sales start to drop,
then the person can identify the problem
and address the issue.
In development, the evaluation comes
at the very end of the project.
I've sat in a lot of those meetings,
and by then,
it is way too late to use the data.
I had somebody from an NGO
once describe it to me as bowling in the dark.
They said, "You roll the ball, you hear some pins go down.
It's dark, you can't see which one goes down until the lights come on,
and then you an see your impact."
Real-time data
turns on the lights.
They're good at tapping into
that local entrepreneurial talent.
Coke's been in Africa since 1928,
but most of the time they couldn't reach the distant markets,
because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world,
which was a large truck rolling down the street.
And in Africa, the remote places,
it's hard to find a good road.
But Coke noticed something --
they noticed that local people were taking the product, buying it in bulk
and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places.
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that.
And they decided in 1990
that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs,
giving them small loans.
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers,
and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people,
who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows
to sell the product.
There are now some 3,000 of these centers
employing about 15,000 people in Africa.
In Tanzania and Uganda,
they represent 90 percent
of Coke's sales.
Let's look at the development side.
can learn from Coke?
Governments and NGOs
need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well,
because the locals know how to reach
the very hard-to-serve places, their neighbors,
and they know what motivates them to make change.
I think a great example of this
is Ethiopia's new health extension program.
The government noticed in Ethiopia
that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic,
they were over a day's travel away from a health clinic.
So if you're in an emergency situation -- or if you're a mom about to deliver a baby --
forget it, to get to the health care center.
They decided that wasn't good enough,
so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala
that also had a system like this,
and they adapted it for Ethiopia.
And in 2003, the government of Ethiopia
started this new system in their own country.
They trained 35,000 health extension workers
to deliver care directly to the people.
In just five years,
their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people
to one worker for every 2,500 people.
how this can change people's lives.
Health extension workers can help with so many things,
whether it's family planning, prenatal care,
immunizations for the children,
or advising the woman to get to the facility on time
for an on-time delivery.
That is having real impact
in a country like Ethiopia,
and it's why you see their child mortality numbers
coming down 25 percent
from 2000 to 2008.
In Ethiopia, there are hundreds of thousands of children living
because of this health extension worker program.
So what's the next step for Ethiopia?
Well, they're already starting talk about this.
They're starting to talk about, "How do you have the health community workers
generate their own ideas?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they're getting
out in those remote villages?"
That's how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent
and you unlock people's potential.
is marketing.
Ultimately, Coke's success
depends on one crucial fact
and that is that people want
a Coca-Cola.
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs
can sell or make a profit
is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow.
So, they rely on Coca-Cola
in terms of its marketing,
and what's the secret to their marketing?
Well, it's aspirational.
It is associated that product
with a kind of life that people want to live.
So even though it's a global company,
they take a very local approach.
Coke's global campaign slogan
is "Open Happiness."
But they localize it.
And they don't just guess what makes people happy;
they go to places like Latin America
and they realize that happiness there
is associated with family life.
And in South Africa,
they associate happiness
with seriti or community respect.
Now, that played itself out in the World Cup campaign.
Let's listen to this song that Coke created for it,
"Wavin' Flag" by a Somali hip hop artist.
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh ♫
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫
♫ Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh ♫
♫Give you freedom, give you fire♫
♫ Give you reason, take you higher ♫
♫ See the champions take the field now ♫
♫ You define us, make us feel proud ♫
♫ In the streets our heads are lifted ♫
♫ As we lose our inhibition ♫
♫ Celebration, it's around us ♫
♫ Every nation, all around us ♫
Well, they didn't stop there --
they localized it into 18 different languages.
And it went number one on the pop chart
in 17 countries.
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood,
"I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing,"
that also went number one on the pop charts.
Both songs have something in common:
that same appeal
of celebration and unity.
So how does health and development market?
Well, it's based on avoidance,
not aspirations.
I'm sure you've heard some of these messages.
"Use a condom, don't get AIDS."
"Wash you hands, you might not get diarrhea."
It doesn't sound anything like "Wavin' Flag" to me.
we make an assumption,
that we think that, if people need something,
we don't have to make them want that.
And I think that's a mistake.
And there's some indications around the world that this is starting to change.
One example is sanitation.
We know that a million and a half children
die a year from diarrhea
and a lot of it is because of open defecation.
But there's a solution: you build a toilet.
But what we're finding around the world, over and over again,
is, if you build a toilet and you leave it there,
it doesn't get used.
People reuse it for a slab for their home.
They sometimes store grain in it.
I've even seen it used for a chicken coop.
(Laughter)
But what does marketing really entail
that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea?
Well, you work with the community.
You start to talk to them about why open defecation
is something that shouldn't be done in the village,
and they agree to that.
But then you take the toilet and you position it
as a modern, trendy convenience.
One state in Northern India has gone so far
as to link toilets to courtship.
And it works -- look at these headlines.
(Laughter)
I'm not kidding.
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets.
No loo, no "I do."
it's innovative. It's an innovative marketing campaign.
But more importantly,
it saves lives.
Take a look at this --
this is a room full of young men
and my husband, Bill.
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for?
They're waiting to be circumcised.
Can you you believe that?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection
by 60 percent in men.
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation,
I have to admit, Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit
and we were saying, "But who's going to volunteer for this procedure?"
But it turns out the men do,
because they're hearing from their girlfriends
that they prefer it,
and the men also believe it improves their sex life.
So if we can start to understand
what people really want
in health and development,
we can change communities
and we can change whole nations.
So let's talk about what happens when this all comes together,
when you tie the three things together.
And polio, I think, is one of the most powerful examples.
We've seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years.
So if you look back to 1988,
there are about 350,000 cases of polio
on the planet that year.
In 2009, we're down to 1,600 cases.
Well how did that happen?
Let's look at a country like India.
They have over a billion people in this country,
but they have 35,000 local doctors
who report paralysis,
and clinicians, a huge reporting system in chemists.
They have two and a half million vaccinators.
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you.
Let me tell you the story of Shriram,
an 18 month boy in Bihar,
a northern state in India.
This year on August 8th, he felt paralysis
and on the 13th, his parents took him to the doctor.
On August 14th and 15th, they took a stool sample,
and by the 25th of August,
it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio.
By August 30th, a genetic test was done,
and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had.
It could have come from Nepal, just to the north, across the border,
or from Jharkhand, a state just to the south.
Luckily, the genetic testing proved
that, in fact, this strand came north,
because, had it come from the south,
it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission.
So many more people would have been affected.
So what's the endgame?
Well on September 4th, there was a huge mop-up campaign,
which is what you do in polio.
They went out and where Shriram lives,
they vaccinated two million people.
So in less than a month,
we went from one case of paralysis
to a targeted vaccination program.
And I'm happy to say only one other person in that area got polio.
That's how you keep
a huge outbreak from spreading,
and it shows what can happen
when local people have the data in their hands;
they can save lives.
but it might not be what you think.
It's not the marketing on the ground.
It's not telling the parents,
"If you see paralysis, take your child to the doctor
or get your child vaccinated."
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community.
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio
over the last 20 years,
but we're starting to have something called polio fatigue
and that is that the donor nations
aren't willing to fund polio any longer.
So by next summer, we're sighted to run out of money on polio.
So we are 99 percent
of the way there on this goal
and we're about to run short of money.
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational,
if we could focus as a community
on how far we've come
and how amazing it would be
to eradicate this disease,
we could put polio fatigue
and polio behind us.
And if we could do that,
we could stop vaccinating everybody, worldwide,
in all of our countries for polio.
And it would only be the second disease ever
wiped off the face of the planet.
And we are so close.
And this victory is so possible.
and asked me to define happiness,
I'd say my vision of happiness
is a mother holding healthy baby
in her arms.
To me, that is deep happiness.
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector,
then in the future we make together,
that happiness
can be just as ubiquitous
as Coca-Cola.
We are here today
because [the] United Nations
have defined goals
for the progress of countries.
They're called Millennium Development Goals.
And the reason I really like these goals
is that there are eight of them.
And by specifying eight different goals,
the United Nations has said
that there are so many things needed
to change in a country
in order to get the good life for people.
Look here -- you have to end poverty,
education, gender,
child and maternal health,
control infections, protect the environment
and get the good global links between nations
in every aspect
from aid to trade.
and that is because each and every one is measured.
Take child mortality;
the aim here is to reduce child mortality
by two-thirds,
from 1990 to 2015.
That's a four percent reduction per year --
and this, with measuring.
That's what makes the difference
between political talking like this
and really going for the important thing,
a better life for people.
And what I'm so happy about with this
is that we have already documented
that there are many countries
in Asia, in the Middle East,
in Latin America and East Europe
that [are] reducing with this rate.
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year,
and Turkey with seven percent per year.
So there's good news.
But then I hear people saying, "There is no progress in Africa.
And there's not even statistics on Africa
to know what is happening."
I'll prove them wrong on both points.
I bring you to the webpage, ChildMortality.org,
where you can take deaths in children
below five years of age for all countries --
it's done by U.N. specialists.
And I will take Kenya as an example.
Here you see the data.
Don't panic -- don't panic now, I'll help you through this.
It looks nasty, like in college
when you didn't like statistics.
But first thing, when you see dots like this,
you have to ask yourself:
from where do the data come?
What is the origin of the data?
Is it so that in Kenya,
there are doctors and other specialists
who write the death certificate at the death of the child
and it's sent to the statistical office?
No -- low-income countries like Kenya
still don't have that level of organization.
It exists, but it's not complete
because so many deaths occur in the home
with the family,
and it's not registered.
What we rely on is not an incomplete system.
We have interviews, we have surveys.
And this is highly professional
female interviewers
who sit down for one hour with a woman
and ask her about [her] birth history.
How many children did you have?
Are they alive?
If they died, at what age and what year?
And then this is done in a representative sample
of thousands of women in the country
and put together in what used to be called
a demographic health survey report.
But these surveys are costly,
so they can only be done [in] three- to five-year intervals.
But they have good quality.
So this is a limitation.
And all these colored lines here are results;
each color is one survey.
But that's too complicated for today, so I'll simplify it for you,
and I give you one average point for each survey.
1992, '97
and 2002.
And when the experts in the U.N.
have got these surveys in place in their database,
then they use advanced mathematical formulas
to produce a trend line, and the trend line looks like this.
See here -- it's the best fit they can get of this point.
But watch out --
they continue the line
beyond the last point
out into nothing.
And they estimated that in 2008,
Kenya had per child mortality of 128.
And I was sad,
because we could see
this reversal in Kenya
with an increased child mortality in the 90s.
It was so tragic.
But in June, I got a mail in my inbox
from Demographic Health Surveys,
and it showed good news from Kenya.
I was so happy.
This was the estimate of the new survey.
Then it just took another three months
for [the] U.N. to get it into their server,
and on Friday we got the new trend line --
it was down here.
Isn't it nice -- isn't it nice, yeah?
I was actually, on Friday, sitting in front of my computer,
and I saw the death rate fall
from 128 to 84 just that morning.
So we celebrated.
how do we measure progress?
I'm going into some details here,
because [the] U.N. do it like this.
They start [in] 1990 -- they measure to 2009.
They say, "0.9 percent, no progress."
That's unfair.
As a professor, I think I have the right to propose something differently.
I would say, at least do this --
10 years is enough to follow the trend.
It's two surveys, and you can see what's happening now.
They have 2.4 percent.
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya,
I may have joined these two points.
So what I'm telling you
is that we know the child mortality.
We have a decent trend.
It's coming into some tricky things then
when we are measuring MDGs.
And the reason here for Africa is especially important,
because '90s was a bad decade,
not only in Kenya, but across Africa.
The HIV epidemic peaked.
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs, until we got the new drugs.
We got, later, the mosquito netting.
And there was socio-economic problems,
which are now being solved at a much better scale.
So look at the average here --
this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa.
And [the] U.N. says
it's a reduction with 1.8 percent.
but it's not so theoretical.
You know, these economists,
they love money, they want more and more of it, they want it to grow.
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of [the] economy.
We in public health, we hate child death,
so we want less and less and less of child deaths.
So we calculate the percent reduction per year,
but it's sort of the same percentage.
If your economy grows with four percent,
you ought to reduce child mortality four percent;
if it's used well and people are really involved
and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it.
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years?
An economist would never do that.
I have just divided it into two periods.
In the 90s, only 1.2 percent,
only 1.2 percent.
Whereas now, second gear --
it's like Africa had first gear,
now they go into second gear.
But even this
is not a fair representation of Africa,
because it's an average,
it's an average speed of reduction in Africa.
Still here,
child death per 1,000 on that axis.
Here we have [the] year.
And I'm now giving you a wider picture than the MDG.
I start 50 years ago
when Africa celebrated independence in most countries.
I give you Congo, which was high,
Ghana -- lower. And Kenya -- even lower.
And what has happened over the years since then? Here we go.
You can see, with independence, literacy improved
and vaccinations started, smallpox was eradicated,
hygiene was improved, and things got better.
But then, in the '80s, watch out here.
Congo got into civil war,
and they leveled off here.
Ghana got very ahead, fast.
This was the backlash in Kenya, and Ghana bypassed,
but then Kenya and Ghana go down together --
still a standstill in Congo.
That's where we are today.
You can see it doesn't make sense
to make an average of this zero improvement
and this very fast improvement.
Time has come
to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place.
Their countries are so different,
and they merit to be recognized in the same way,
as we don't talk about Europe as one place.
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different --
everyone knows that.
And they are judged, each country, on how they are doing.
My country, Sweden:
1800, we were up there.
What a strange personality disorder we must have,
counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate.
It's very strange. It's sort of embarrassing.
But we had that habit in Sweden, you know,
that we counted all the child deaths,
even if we didn't do anything about it.
And then, you see, these were famine years.
These were bad years, and people got fed up with Sweden.
My ancestors moved to the United States.
And eventually, soon they started to get better and better here.
And here we got better education, and we got health service,
and child mortality came down.
We never had a war; Sweden was in peace all this time.
But look, the rate of lowering
in Sweden
was not fast.
Sweden achieved a low child mortality
because we started early.
We had primary school actually
started in 1842.
And then you get that wonderful effect
when we got female literacy
one generation later.
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress
are long-term investments.
It's not about just five years --
it's long-term investments.
And Sweden never reached [the] Millennium Development Goal rate,
3.1 percent when I calculated.
So we are off track -- that's what Sweden is.
But you don't talk about it so much.
We want others to be better than we were, and indeed, others have been better.
see what a success story, Thailand from the 1960s --
how they went down here
and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden.
And I'll give you another story -- Egypt,
the most hidden, glorious success in public health.
Egypt was up here in 1960,
higher than Congo.
The Nile Delta was a misery for children
with diarrheal disease
and malaria and a lot of problems.
And then they got the Aswan Dam. They got electricity in their homes,
they increased education
and they got primary health care.
And down they went, you know.
And they got safer water, they eradicated malaria.
And isn't it a success story.
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality
is fully possible.
And the good thing is
that Ghana today is going with the same rate
as Egypt did at its fastest.
Kenya is now speeding up.
Here we have a problem.
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill.
a wider picture of child mortality.
I'm going to show you the relationship
between child mortality on this axis here --
this axis here is child mortality --
and here I have the family size.
The relationship between child mortality and family size.
One, two, three, four children per woman:
six, seven, eight children per woman.
This is, once again, 1960 --
50 years ago.
Each bubble is a country --
the color, you can see, a continent.
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa.
And the size of the bubble is the population.
And these are
the so-called "developing" countries.
They had high, or very high, child mortality
and family size, six to eight.
And the ones over there,
they were so-called Western countries.
They had low child mortality
and small families.
What has happened?
What I want you [to do] now is to see with your own eyes
the relation between fall in child mortality
and decrease in family size.
I just want not to have any room for doubt --
you have to see that for yourself.
This is what happened. Now I start the world.
Here we come down with the eradication of
smallpox, better education,
health service.
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here.
And here Brazil is in the Western Box.
India is approaching. The first African countries coming into the Western box,
and we get a lot a new neighbors.
Welcome to a decent life.
Come on. We want everyone down there.
This is the vision we have, isn't it.
And look now, the first African countries here are coming in.
There we are today.
as a "Western world" and "developing world."
This is the report from [the] U.N.,
which came out on Friday.
It's very good -- "Levels and Trends in Child Mortality" --
except this page.
This page is very bad;
it's a categorization of countries.
It labels "developing countries," -- I can read from the list here --
developing countries: Republic of Korea -- South Korea.
Huh?
They get Samsung, how can they be [a] developing country?
They have here Singapore.
They have the lowest child mortality in the world, Singapore.
They bypassed Sweden five years ago,
and they are labeled a developing country.
They have here Qatar.
It's the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera.
How the heck could they be [a] developing country?
This is crap.
(Applause)
The rest here is good -- the rest is good.
which fits to the data.
And we have to realize
that we are all going to into this, down to here.
What is the importance now with the relations here.
Look -- even if we look in Africa --
these are the African countries.
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality
and decreasing family size,
even within Africa.
It's very clear that this is what happens.
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday
from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle
showing that almost 50 percent
of the fall in child mortality
can be attributed to female education.
That is, when we get girls in school,
we'll get an impact 15 to 20 years later,
which is a secular trend which is very strong.
That's why we must have that long-term perspective,
but we must measure the impact
over 10-year periods.
It's fully possible
to get child mortality down in all of these countries
and to get them down in the corner
where we all would like to live together.
is a matter of utmost importance
from humanitarian aspects.
It's a decent life for children,
we are talking about.
But it is also a strategic investment
in the future of all mankind,
because it's about the environment.
We will not be able to manage the environment
and avoid the terrible climate crisis
if we don't stabilize the world population.
Let's be clear about that.
And the way to do that,
that is to get child mortality down, get access to family planning
and behind that drive female education.
And that is fully possible. Let's do it.
John Hockenberry: It's great to be here with you, Tom.
And I want to start with a question
that has just been consuming me
since I first became familiar with your work.
In you work there's always this kind of hybrid quality
of a natural force
in some sort of interplay with creative force.
Are they ever in equilibrium
in the way that you see your work?
it's usually to solve a question.
I had the question popped into my head:
What does the cone that connects the sun and the Earth look like
if you could connect the two spheres?
And in proportion, what would the size of the sphere
and the length, and what would the taper be to the Earth?
And so I went about and made that sculpture,
turning it out of solid bronze.
And I did one that was about 35 feet long.
The sun end was about four inches in diameter,
and then it tapered over about 35 feet
to about a millimeter at the Earth end.
And so for me, it was really exciting
just to see what it looks like
if you could step outside and into a larger context,
as though you were an astronaut,
and see these two things as an object,
because they are so intimately bound,
and one is meaningless without the other.
in playing with these forces?
And I'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is
in playing with these forces.
like that silver one there,
that was the result
of hundreds of experiments with magnets,
trying to find a way to make something float
with the least possible connection to the ground.
So I got it down to just one tether
to be able to support that.
It's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art.
are a combination of gravity and magnetism,
so it's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces
that influence everything.
The sun has a tremendous field
that extends way beyond the planets
and the Earth's magnetic field protects us from the sun.
So there's this huge
invisible shape structures
that magnetism takes in the universe.
But with the pendulum,
it allows me to manifest
these invisible forces
that are holding the magnets up.
My sculptures
are normally very simplified.
I try to refine them down
to very simple forms.
But the paintings become very complex,
because I think the fields
that are supporting them,
they're billowing, and they're interpenetrating,
and they're interference patterns.
I mean, you don't know necessarily where you're headed when you begin,
even though the forces can be calculated.
So the evolution of this --
I gather this isn't your first pendulum.
and I just had a simple cone
with a spigot at the bottom of it.
I threw it into an orbit,
and it only had one color,
and when it got to the center, the paint kept running out,
so I had to run in there,
didn't have any control over the spigot remotely.
So that told me right away: I need a remote control device.
But then I started dreaming of having six colors.
I sort of think about it as the DNA --
these colors, the red, blue, yellow,
the primary colors and white and black.
And if you put them together in different combinations --
just like printing in a sense,
like how a magazine color is printed --
and put them under certain forces,
which is orbiting them
or passing them back and forth
or drawing with them,
these amazing things started appearing.
I'll ask a couple of my sons
to set up the canvases here.
I want to just say --
so this is Jack, Nick and Louie.
and see if I can paint everybody's shoes in the front.
ooh, nice.
I'm doing this as a demo,
and it's more playful,
but inevitably,
all of this can be used.
I can redeem this painting,
just continuing on,
doing layers upon layers.
And I keep it around for a couple of weeks,
and I'm contemplating it,
and I'll do another session with it
and bring it up to another level,
where all of this
becomes the background, the depth of it.
So the valves at the bottom of those tubes there
are like radio-controlled airplane valves.
that pinch these rubber tubes.
And they can pinch them very tight and stop it,
or you can have them wide open.
And all of the colors
come out one central port
at the bottom.
You can always be changing colors, put aluminum paint,
or I could put anything into this.
It could be tomato sauce,
or anything could be dispensed --
sand, powders or anything like that.
You've got gravity, you've got the centrifugal force,
you've got the fluid dynamics.
Each of these beautiful paintings,
are they images in and of themselves,
or are they records
of a physical event
called the pendulum approaching the canvas?
I wanted to do something very simple,
a simple, iconic image
of two ripples interfering.
So the one on the right was done first,
and then the one on the left
was done over it.
And then I left gaps
so you could see the one that was done before.
And then when I did the second one,
it really disturbed the piece --
these big blue lines
crashing through the center of it --
and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap.
There are lines in front of the one on the right,
and there are lines behind the one on the left,
and so it takes it into different planes.
What it's also about,
just the little events,
the events of the interpenetration of --
there's an interference pattern, and then a third thing happens.
There are shapes that come about
just by the marriage
of two events that are happening,
and I'm very interested in that.
Like the occurrence of moire patterns.
Like this green one,
this is a painting I did about 10 years ago,
but it has some --
see, in the upper third --
there are these moires and interference patterns
that are radio kind of imagery.
And that's something that in painting
I've never seen done.
I've never seen a representation
of a kind of radio interference patterns,
which are so ubiquitous
and such an important part of our lives.
or is my eye making that interference pattern --
is my eye completing that interference pattern?
makes it real.
It's really manifested there.
If I throw a very concentric circle,
or concentric ellipse,
it just dutifully makes
these evenly spaced lines,
which get closer and closer together,
which describes how gravity works.
There's something very appealing
about the exactitude of science
that I really enjoy.
And I love the shapes that I see
in scientific observations
and apparatus,
especially astronomical forms
and the idea of the vastness of it,
the scale,
is very interesting to me.
has kind of shifted more toward biology.
Some of these paintings, when you look at them very close,
odd things appear
that really look like horses or birds
or crocodiles, elephants.
There are lots of things that appear.
When you look into it, it's sort of like looking at cloud patterns,
but sometimes they're very modeled and highly rendered.
And then there are all these forms
that we don't know what they are,
but they're equally well-resolved
and complex.
So I think, conceivably, those could be predictive.
Because since it has the ability
to make forms
that look like forms that we're familiar with
in biology,
it's also making other forms that we're not familiar with.
And maybe it's the kind of forms
we'll discover underneath the surface of Mars,
where there are probably lakes
with fish swimming under the surface.
Oh, please, yes. Oh, I'm so there.
You know, it seems
at this stage in your life,
you also very personally
are in this state of confrontation
with a sort of dissonant --
I suppose it's an electromagnetic force
that somehow governs your Parkinson's
and this creative force
that is both the artist
who is in the here and now
and this sort of arc of your whole life.
Is that relevant to your work?
this device kind of comes in handy,
because I don't have to have
the fine motor skills to do,
that I can operate slides,
which is more of a mental process.
I'm looking at it and making decisions:
It needs more red, it needs more blue,
it needs a different shape.
And so I make these creative decisions
and can execute them
in a much, much simpler way.
I mean, I've got the symptoms.
I guess Parkinson's kind of creeps up over the years,
but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms.
In my case,
my left hand has a significant tremor
and my left leg also.
I'm left-handed, and so I draw.
All my creations
really start on small drawings,
which I have thousands of,
and it's my way of just thinking.
I draw with a simple pencil,
and at first, the Parkinson's
was really upsetting,
because I couldn't get the pencil to stand still.
You don't think of yourself as the master of these forces.
You think of yourself as the servant.
It just has so much in it.
And I think nature
wants to express itself
in the sense that we are nature,
humans are of the universe.
The universe is in our mind,
and our minds are in the universe.
And we are expressions
of the universe, basically.
As humans,
ultimately being part of the universe,
we're kind of the spokespeople
or the observer part
of the constituency
of the universe.
And to interface with it,
with a device that lets these forces
that are everywhere
act and show what they can do,
giving them pigment and paint just like an artist,
it's a good ally.
It's a terrific studio assistant.
that somewhere within this idea
of fine motion and control
with the traditional skills
that you have with your hand,
some sort of more elemental force gets revealed,
and that's the beauty here.
Tom, thank you so much. It's been really, really great.
I've been fascinated for a lifetime
by the beauty, form and function
of giant bluefin tuna.
Bluefin are warmblooded like us.
They're the largest of the tunas,
the second-largest fish in the sea -- bony fish.
They actually are a fish
that is endothermic --
powers through the ocean with warm muscles like a mammal.
That's one of our bluefin at the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
You can see in its shape and its streamlined design
it's powered for ocean swimming.
It flies through the ocean on its pectoral fins, gets lift,
powers its movements
with a lunate tail.
It's actually got a naked skin for most of its body,
so it reduces friction with the water.
This is what one of nature's finest machines.
were revered by Man
for all of human history.
For 4,000 years, we fished sustainably for this animal,
and it's evidenced
in the art that we see
from thousands of years ago.
Bluefin are in cave paintings in France.
They're on coins
that date back 3,000 years.
This fish was revered by humankind.
It was fished sustainably
till all of time,
except for our generation.
Bluefin are pursued wherever they go --
there is a gold rush on Earth,
and this is a gold rush for bluefin.
There are traps that fish sustainably
up until recently.
And yet, the type of fishing going on today,
with pens, with enormous stakes,
is really wiping bluefin
ecologically off the planet.
Now bluefin, in general,
goes to one place: Japan.
Some of you may be guilty
of having contributed to the demise of bluefin.
They're delectable muscle,
rich in fat --
absolutely taste delicious.
And that's their problem; we're eating them to death.
Now in the Atlantic, the story is pretty simple.
Bluefin have two populations: one large, one small.
The North American population
The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna --
is fished at tremendous levels:
at the West or the Eastern bluefin population,
there's been tremendous decline on both sides,
as much as 90 percent
if you go back with your baseline
to 1950.
For that, bluefin have been given a status
equivalent to tigers, to lions,
to certain African elephants
and to pandas.
These fish have been proposed
for an endangered species listing in the past two months.
They were voted on and rejected
just two weeks ago,
despite outstanding science
that shows from two committees
this fish meets the criteria of CITES I.
And if it's tunas you don't care about,
perhaps you might be interested
that international long lines and pursing
chase down tunas and bycatch animals
such as leatherbacks, sharks,
marlin, albatross.
These animals and their demise
occurs in the tuna fisheries.
The challenge we face
is that we know very little about tuna,
and everyone in the room knows what it looks like
when an African lion
takes down its prey.
I doubt anyone has seen a giant bluefin feed.
This tuna symbolizes
what's the problem for all of us in the room.
to really study our oceans in a deep way.
Technology has come of age
that's allowing us to see the Earth from space
and go deep into the seas remotely.
And we've got to use these technologies immediately
to get a better understanding
of how our ocean realm works.
Most of us from the ship -- even I --
look out at the ocean and see this homogeneous sea.
We don't know where the structure is.
We can't tell where are the watering holes
like we can on an African plain.
We can't see the corridors,
and we can't see what it is
that brings together a tuna,
a leatherback and an albatross.
We're only just beginning to understand
how the physical oceanography
and the biological oceanography
come together
to create a seasonal force
that actually causes the upwelling
that might make a hot spot a hope spot.
The reasons these challenges are great
is that technically it's difficult to go to sea.
It's hard to study a bluefin on its turf,
the entire Pacific realm.
It's really tough to get up close and personal with a mako shark
and try to put a tag on it.
And then imagine being Bruce Mate's team from OSU,
getting up close to a blue whale
and fixing a tag on the blue whale that stays,
an engineering challenge
we've yet to really overcome.
is fish and chips.
We basically are taking
the same satellite phone parts,
or the same parts that are in your computer, chips.
We're putting them together in unusual ways,
and this is taking us into the ocean realm
like never before.
And for the first time,
we're able to watch the journey of a tuna beneath the ocean
using light and photons
to measure sunrise and sunset.
Now, I've been working with tunas for over 15 years.
I have the privilege of being a partner
with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
We've actually taken a sliver of the ocean,
put it behind glass,
and we together
have put bluefin tuna and yellowfin tuna on display.
When the veil of bubbles lifts every morning,
we can actually see a community from the Pelagic ocean,
one of the only places on Earth
you can see giant bluefin swim by.
We can see in their beauty of form and function,
their ceaseless activity.
They're flying through their space, ocean space.
And we can bring two million people a year
into contact with this fish
and show them its beauty.
partnered with the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
Here, for over 14 or 15 years,
we've actually brought in
both bluefin and yellowfin in captivity.
We'd been studying these fish,
but first we had to learn how to husbandry them.
What do they like to eat?
What is it that they're happy with?
We go in the tanks with the tuna -- we touch their naked skin --
it's pretty amazing. It feels wonderful.
And then, better yet,
we've got our own version of tuna whisperers,
our own Chuck Farwell, Alex Norton,
who can take a big tuna
and in one motion,
put it into an envelope of water,
so that we can actually work with the tuna
and learn the techniques it takes
to not injure this fish
who never sees a boundary in the open sea.
Jeff and Jason there, are scientists
who are going to take a tuna
and put it in the equivalent of a treadmill, a flume.
And that tuna thinks it's going to Japan, but it's staying in place.
We're actually measuring its oxygen consumption,
its energy consumption.
We're taking this data and building better models.
And when I see that tuna -- this is my favorite view --
I begin to wonder:
how did this fish solve the longitude problem before we did?
So take a look at that animal.
That's the closest you'll probably ever get.
Now, the activities from the lab
have taught us now how to go out in the open ocean.
we've actually gone from Ireland to Canada,
from Corsica to Spain.
We've fished with many nations around the world
in an effort to basically
put electronic computers
inside giant tunas.
We've actually tagged 1,100 tunas.
And I'm going to show you three clips,
because I tagged 1,100 tunas.
It's a very hard process, but it's a ballet.
We bring the tuna out, we measure it.
A team of fishers, captains, scientists and technicians
work together to keep this animal out of the ocean
for about four to five minutes.
We put water over its gills, give it oxygen.
And then with a lot of effort, after tagging,
putting in the computer,
making sure the stalk is sticking out so it senses the environment,
we send this fish back into the sea.
And when it goes, we're always happy.
We see a flick of the tail.
And from our data that gets collected,
when that tag comes back,
because a fisher returns it
for a thousand-dollar reward,
we can get tracks beneath the sea
for up to five years now,
on a backboned animal.
such as this fish off Nantucket.
But that's about half the size
of the biggest tuna we've ever tagged.
It takes a human effort,
a team effort, to bring the fish in.
In this case, what we're going to do
is put a pop-up satellite archival tag on the tuna.
This tag rides on the tuna,
senses the environment around the tuna
and actually will come off the fish,
detach, float to the surface
and send back to Earth-orbiting satellites
position data estimated by math on the tag,
pressure data and temperature data.
And so what we get then from the pop-up satellite tag
is we get away from having to have a human interaction
to recapture the tag.
Both the electronic tags I'm talking about are expensive.
These tags have been engineered
by a variety of teams in North America.
They are some of our finest instruments,
our new technology in the ocean today.
One community in general
has given more to help us than any other community.
And that's the fisheries off the state of North Carolina.
There are two villages, Harris and Morehead City,
every winter for over a decade,
held a party called Tag-A-Giant,
and together, fishers worked with us
to tag 800 to 900 fish.
In this case, we're actually going to measure the fish.
We're going to do something that in recent years we've started:
take a mucus sample.
Watch how shiny the skin is; you can see my reflection there.
And from that mucus, we can get gene profiles,
we can get information on gender,
checking the pop-up tag one more time,
and then it's out in the ocean.
And this is my favorite.
this is a gorgeous picture of a single tuna.
This tuna is actually moving on a numerical ocean.
The warm is the Gulf Stream,
the cold up there in the Gulf of Maine.
That's where the tuna wants to go -- it wants to forage on schools of herring --
but it can't get there. It's too cold.
But then it warms up, and the tuna pops in, gets some fish,
maybe comes back to home base,
goes in again
and then comes back to winter down there in North Carolina
and then on to the Bahamas.
And my favorite scene, three tunas going into the Gulf of Mexico.
Three tunas tagged.
Astronomically, we're calculating positions.
They're coming together. That could be tuna sex --
and there it is.
That is where the tuna spawn.
So from data like this,
we're able now to put the map up,
and in this map
you see thousands of positions
generated by this decade and a half of tagging.
And now we're showing that tunas on the western side
go to the eastern side.
So two populations of tunas --
that is, we have a Gulf population, one that we can tag --
they go to the Gulf of Mexico, I showed you that --
and a second population.
Living amongst our tunas -- our North American tunas --
are European tunas that go back to the Med.
On the hot spots -- the hope spots --
they're mixed populations.
is we're showing the International Commission,
building new models,
showing them that a two-stock no-mixing model --
to this day, used to reject
the CITES treaty --
that model isn't the right model.
This model, a model of overlap,
is the way to move forward.
So we can then predict
where management places should be.
Places like the Gulf of Mexico and the Mediterranean
are places where the single species,
the single population, can be captured.
These become forthright in places we need to protect.
The center of the Atlantic where the mixing is,
I could imagine a policy that lets Canada and America fish,
because they manage their fisheries well,
they're doing a good job.
But in the international realm,
where fishing and overfishing has really gone wild,
these are the places that we have to make hope spots in.
That's the size they have to be to protect the bluefin tuna.
called Tagging of Pacific Pelagics,
we took on the planet as a team,
those of us in the Census of Marine Life.
And, funded primarily through Sloan Foundation and others,
we were able to actually go in, in our project --
we're one of 17 field programs
and begin to take on tagging large numbers of predators,
not just tunas.
So what we've done
is actually gone up to tag salmon shark in Alaska,
met salmon shark on their home territory,
followed them catching salmon
and then went in and figured out
that, if we take a salmon and put it on a line,
we can actually take up a salmon shark --
This is the cousin of the white shark --
and very carefully --
note, I say "very carefully," --
we can actually keep it calm,
put a hose in its mouth, keep it off the deck
and then tag it with a satellite tag.
That satellite tag will now have your shark phone home
and send in a message.
And that shark leaping there, if you look carefully, has an antenna.
It's a free swimming shark with a satellite tag
jumping after salmon,
sending home its data.
Salmon sharks aren't the only sharks we tag.
But there goes salmon sharks with this meter-level resolution
on an ocean of temperature -- warm colors are warmer.
Salmon sharks go down
to the tropics to pup
and come into Monterey.
are a white shark team led by Scott Anderson -- there --
and Sal Jorgensen.
They can throw out a target --
it's a carpet shaped like a seal --
and in will come a white shark, a curious critter
that will come right up to our 16-ft. boat.
It's a several thousand-pound animal.
And we'll wind in the target.
And we'll place an acoustic tag
that says, "OMSHARK 10165,"
or something like that, acoustically with a ping.
And then we'll put on a satellite tag
that will give us the long-distance journeys
with the light-based geolocation algorithms
solved on the computer that's on the fish.
So in this case, Sal's looking at two tags there,
and there they are: the white sharks of California
going off to the white shark cafe and coming back.
We also tag makos with our NOAA colleagues,
blue sharks.
And now, together, what we can see
on this ocean of color that's temperature,
we can see ten-day worms of makos and salmon sharks.
We have white sharks and blue sharks.
For the first time,
an ecoscape as large as ocean-scale,
showing where the sharks go.
three teams tagged 1,700 tunas,
bluefin, yellowfin and albacore
all at the same time --
carefully rehearsed tagging programs
in which we go out, pick up juvenile tunas,
put in the tags that actually have the sensors,
stick out the tuna
and then let them go.
They get returned, and when they get returned,
here on a NASA numerical ocean
you can see bluefin in blue
go across their corridor,
returning to the Western Pacific.
with tags that are glued on their heads, that come off when they slough.
These elephant seals cover half an ocean,
take data down to 1,800 feet --
amazing data.
And then there's Scott Shaffer and our shearwaters
wearing tuna tags, light-based tags,
that now are going to take you from New Zealand to Monterey and back,
journeys of 35,000 nautical miles
we had never seen before.
But now with light-based geolocation tags that are very small,
we can actually see these journeys.
Same thing with Laysan albatross
who travel an entire ocean
on a trip sometimes,
up to the same zone the tunas use.
You can see why they might be caught.
Then there's George Schillinger and our leatherback team out of Playa Grande
tagging leatherbacks
that go right past where we are.
And Scott Benson's team
that showed that leatherbacks go from Indonesia
all the way to Monterey.
So what we can see on this moving ocean
is we can finally see where the predators are.
We can actually see how they're using ecospaces
as large as an ocean.
we can begin to map the hope spots.
So this is just three years of data right here --
and there's a decade of this data.
We see the pulse and the seasonal activities
that these animals are going on.
So what we're able to do with this information
is boil it down to hot spots,
4,000 deployments,
a huge herculean task,
2,000 tags
in an area, shown here for the first time,
off the California coast,
that appears to be a gathering place.
And then for sort of an encore from these animals,
they're helping us.
They're carrying instruments
that are actually taking data down to 2,000 meters.
They're taking information from our planet
at very critical places like Antarctica and the Poles.
Those are seals from many countries
being released
who are sampling underneath the ice sheets
and giving us temperature data of oceanographic quality
on both poles.
We still haven't figured out best how to visualize the data.
And then, as these animals swim
and give us the information
that's important to climate issues,
we also think it's critical
to get this information to the public,
to engage the public with this kind of data.
We did this with the Great Turtle Race --
tagged turtles, brought in four million hits.
And now with Google's Oceans,
we can actually put a white shark in that ocean.
And when we do and it swims,
we see this magnificent bathymetry
that the shark knows is there on its path
as it goes from California to Hawaii.
But maybe Mission Blue
can fill in that ocean that we can't see.
We've got the capacity, NASA has the ocean.
We just need to put it together.
we know where Yellowstone is for North America;
it's off our coast.
We have the technology that's shown us where it is.
What we need to think about perhaps for Mission Blue
is increasing the biologging capacity.
How is it that we can actually
take this type of activity elsewhere?
And then finally -- to basically get the message home --
maybe use live links
from animals such as blue whales and white sharks.
Make killer apps, if you will.
A lot of people are excited
when sharks actually went under the Golden Gate Bridge.
Let's connect the public to this activity right on their iPhone.
That way we do away with a few internet myths.
We can save the white shark.
We have the science and technology.
Hope is here. Yes we can.
We need just to apply this capacity
further in the oceans.
I learned about the Haiti earthquake by Skype.
My wife sent me a message,
"Whoa, earthquake,"
and then disappeared for 25 minutes.
It was 25 minutes of absolute terror
that thousands of people across the U.S. felt.
I was afraid of a tsunami;
what I didn't realize
was there was a greater terror in Haiti,
and that was building collapse.
We've all seen the photos
of the collapsed buildings in Haiti.
These are shots my wife took
a couple days after the quake,
while I was making my way through the D.R. into the country.
This is the national palace --
the equivalent of the White House.
This is the largest supermarket in the Caribbean
at peak shopping time.
This is a nurses' college --
there are 300 nurses studying.
The general hospital right next door
emerged largely unscathed.
This is the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
about the tremendous human loss
in the earthquake in Haiti,
but we haven't heard enough
about why all those lives were lost.
We haven't heard about
why the buildings failed.
After all, it was the buildings,
not the earthquake,
that killed 220,000 people,
that injured 330,000,
that displaced 1.3 million people,
that cut off food
and water and supplies
for an entire nation.
This is the largest metropolitan-area disaster
in decades,
and it was not a natural disaster --
it was a disaster of engineering.
since 2007,
providing engineering and business support
to small businesses.
And after the quake, we started bringing in earthquake engineers
to figure out why the buildings collapsed,
to examine what was safe and what wasn't.
Working with MINUSTAH,
which is the U.N. mission in Haiti,
with the Ministry of Public Works,
with different NGOs,
we inspected over 1,500 buildings.
We inspected schools
and private residencies.
We inspected medical centers
and food warehouses.
We inspected government buildings.
Behind that door
is the National Judicial Archives.
The fellow in the door, Andre Filitrault --
who's the director
of the Center for Interdisciplinary Earthquake Engineering Research
at the University of Buffalo --
was examining it to see if it was safe
to recover the archives.
Andre told me,
after seeing these buildings fail
again and again in the same way,
that there is no new research here.
There is nothing here that we don't know.
The failure points were the same:
walls and slabs not tied properly into columns --
that's a roof slab hanging off the building --
cantilevered structures,
or structures that were asymmetric,
that shook violently and came down,
poor building materials,
not enough concrete,
not enough compression in the blocks,
rebar that was smooth,
rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away.
to all these problems.
And we know how to build properly.
The proof of this came in Chile,
almost a month later,
when 8.8 magnitude earthquake
hit Chile.
That is 500 times
the power of the 7.0
that hit Port-au-Prince --
500 times the power,
yet only under a thousand casualties.
Adjusted for population density,
that is less than one percent
of the impact of the Haitian quake.
What was the difference
between Chile and Haiti?
Seismic standards
and confined masonry,
where the building acts as a whole --
walls and columns
and roofs and slabs
tied together to support each other --
instead of breaking off into separate members and failing.
If you look at this building in Chile,
it's ripped in half,
but it's not a pile of rubble.
Chileans have been building with confined masonry
for decades.
Architecture for Humanity,
to bring more confined masonry training
into Haiti.
This is Xantus Daniel;
he's a mason,
just a general construction worker, not a foreman,
who took one of our trainings.
On his last job he was working with his boss,
and they started pouring the columns wrong.
He took his boss aside,
and he showed him the materials on confined masonry.
He showed him, "You know, we don't have to do this wrong.
It won't cost us any more
to do it the right way."
And they redid that building.
They tied the rebar right,
they poured the columns right,
and that building will be safe.
And every building
that they build going forward
will be safe.
it's not going to take policy --
it's going to take reaching out
to the masons on the ground
and helping them learn the proper techniques.
Now there are many groups doing this.
And the fellow in the vest there,
Craig Toten,
he has pushed forward
to get documentation out to all the groups that are doing this.
Through Haiti Rewired,
through Build Change, Architecture for Humanity,
AIDG,
there is the possibility
to reach out
to 30,000 -- 40,000 masons
across the country
and create a movement of proper building.
If you reach out to the people on the ground
in this collaborative way
it's extremely affordable.
For the billions spent on reconstruction,
you can train masons
for dollars on every house
that they end up building over their lifetime.
that you can rebuild Haiti;
the way at the top
is the way that Haiti's been building for decades.
The way at the top
is a poorly constructed building
that will fail.
The way at the bottom is a confined masonry building,
where the walls are tied together,
the building is symmetric,
and it will stand up to an earthquake.
For all the disaster,
there is an opportunity here
to build better houses
for the next generation,
so that when the next earthquake hits,
it is a disaster --
but not a tragedy.
Sometimes I go browsing
[through] a very old magazine.
I found this observation test
about the story of the ark.
And the artist that drew this observation test
did some errors, had some mistakes --
there are more or less 12 mistakes.
Some of them are very easy.
There is a funnel, an aerial part,
a lamp and clockwork key on the ark.
Some of them are about the animals, the number.
But there is a much more fundamental mistake
in the overall story of the ark
that's not reported here.
And this problem is: where are the plants?
So now we have God
that is going to submerge Earth permanently
or at least for a very long period,
and no one is taking care of plants.
Noah needed to take two of every kind of bird,
of every kind of animal,
of every kind of creature that moves,
but no mention about plants.
Why?
In another part of the same story,
all the living creatures
are just the living creatures
that came out from the ark,
so birds, livestock and wild animals.
Plants are not living creatures --
this is the point.
That is a point that is not
coming out from the Bible,
but it's something that
really accompanied humanity.
that is coming from a Renaissance book.
Here we have the description
of the order of nature.
It's a nice description because it's starting from left --
you have the stones --
immediately after the stones, the plants
that are just able to live.
We have the animals that are able to live and to sense,
and on the top of the pyramid,
there is the man.
This is not the common man.
The "Homo studiosus" -- the studying man.
This is quite comforting
for people like me -- I'm a professor --
this to be over there on the top of creation.
But it's something completely wrong.
You know very well about professors.
But it's also wrong about plants,
because plants are not just able to live;
they are able to sense.
They are much more sophisticated
in sensing than animals.
Just to give you an example,
every single root apex
is able to detect and to monitor
concurrently and continuously
at least 15 different chemical
and physical parameters.
And they also are able to show and to exhibit
such a wonderful and complex behavior
that can be described just with the term of intelligence.
Well, but this is something --
this underestimation of plants is something
that is always with us.
We have David Attenborough.
Now David Attenborough is really a plant lover;
he did some of the most beautiful movies
about plant behavior.
Now, when he speaks about plants,
everything is correct.
When he speaks about animals,
[he] tends to remove the fact
that plants exist.
The blue whale,
the biggest creature that exists on the planet --
that is wrong, completely wrong.
The blue whale, it's a dwarf
if compared with the real biggest creature
that exists on the planet --
that is, this wonderful,
magnificent Sequoiadendron giganteum.
(Applause)
And this is a living organism
that has a mass of at least 2,000 tons.
Now, the story
that plants are some low-level organisms
has been formalized
many times ago by Aristotle,
that in "De Anima" --
that is a very influential book for the Western civilization --
wrote that the plants are on the edge
between living and not living.
They have just a kind of very low-level soul.
It's called the vegetative soul,
because they lack movement,
and so they don't need to sense.
Let's see.
This is a very fast movement.
This is a Dionaea, a Venus fly trap
hunting snails --
sorry for the snail.
This has been something that has been refused for centuries,
despite the evidence.
No one can say that the plants were able to eat an animal,
because it was against the order of nature.
But plants are also able
to show a lot of movement.
Some of them are very well known, like the flowering.
It's just a question to use some techniques
like the time lapse.
Some of them are much more sophisticated.
Look at this young bean
that is moving to catch the light every time.
And it's really so graceful;
it's like a dancing angel.
They are also able to play --
they are really playing.
These are young sunflowers,
and what they are doing
cannot be described
with any other terms than playing.
They are training themselves,
as many young animals do,
to the adult life
where they will be called to track the sun
all the day.
They are able to respond to gravity, of course,
so the shoots are growing
against the vector of gravity
and the roots toward the vector of gravity.
But they are also able to sleep.
This is one, Mimosa pudica.
So during the night,
they curl the leaves
and reduce the movement,
and during the day, you have the opening of the leaves --
there is much more movement.
This is interesting
because this sleeping machinery,
it's perfectly conserved.
It's the same in plants, in insects
and in animals.
And so if you need to study this sleeping problem,
it's easy to study on plants, for example,
than in animals
and it's much more easy even ethically.
It's a kind of vegetarian
experimentation.
they are extraordinary communicators.
They communicate with other plants.
They are able to distinguish kin and non-kin.
They communicate
with plants of other species
and they communicate with animals
by producing chemical volatiles,
for example, during the pollination.
Now with the pollination, it's a very serious issue for plants,
because they move the pollen from one flower to the other,
yet they cannot move from one flower to the other.
So they need a vector --
and this vector,
it's normally an animal.
Many insects
have been used by plants as vectors
for the transport of the pollination,
but not just insects; even birds, reptiles,
and mammals like bats rats
are normally used for the transportation of the pollen.
This is a serious business.
We have the plants that are giving to the animals
a kind of sweet substance --
very energizing --
having in change this transportation of the pollen.
But some plants are manipulating animals,
like in the case of orchids
that promise sex and nectar
and give in change nothing
for the transportation of the pollen.
behind all this behavior that we have seen.
How is it possible to do this without a brain?
We need to wait until 1880,
when this big man,
Charles Darwin,
publishes a wonderful, astonishing book
that starts a revolution.
The title is "The Power of Movement in Plants."
No one was allowed to speak about movement in plants
before Charles Darwin.
In his book,
assisted by his son, Francis --
who was the first professor of plant physiology in the world, in Cambridge --
they took into consideration every single movement
for 500 pages.
And in the last paragraph of the book,
it's a kind of stylistic mark,
because normally Charles Darwin stored,
in the last paragraph of a book,
the most important message.
He wrote that,
"It's hardly an exaggeration
to say that the tip of the radical
acts like the brain
of one of the lower animals."
This is not a metaphor.
He wrote some very interesting letters to one of his friends
who was J.D. Hooker, or at that time, president of the Royal Society,
so the maximum scientific authority in Britain
speaking about the brain in the plants.
growing against a slope.
So you can recognize this kind of movement,
the same movement that worms, snakes
and every animal
that are moving on the ground without legs
is able to display.
And it's not an easy movement
because, to have this kind of movement,
you need to move different regions of the root
and to synchronize these different regions
without having a brain.
So we studied the root apex
and we found that there is a specific region
that is here, depicted in blue --
that is called the "transition zone."
And this region, it's a very small region --
it's less than one millimeter.
And in this small region
you have the highest consumption
of oxygen in the plants
and more important,
you have these kinds of signals here.
The signals that you are seeing here are action potential,
are the same signals
that the neurons of my brain, of our brain,
use to exchange information.
Now we know that a root apex
has just a few hundred cells
that show this kind of feature,
but we know how big
the root apparatus of a small plant, like a plant of rye.
We have almost
14 million roots.
We have 11 and a half million
root apex
and a total length of 600 or more kilometers
and a very high surface area.
that each single root apex
is working in network with all the others.
Here were have on the left, the Internet
and on the right, the root apparatus.
They work in the same way.
They are a network
of small computing machines,
working in networks.
And why are they so similar?
Because they evolved
for the same reason:
to survive predation.
They work in the same way.
So you can remove 90 percent of the root apparatus
and the plants [continue] to work.
You can remove 90 percent of the Internet
and it is [continuing] to work.
So, a suggestion
for the people working with networks:
plants are able
to give you good suggestions
about how to evolve networks.
is a technological possibility.
Let's imagine
that we can build robots
and robots that are inspired by plants.
Until now,
the man was inspired
just by man or the animals
in producing a robot.
We have the animaloid --
and the normal robots inspired by animals,
insectoid, so on.
We have the androids
that are inspired by man.
But why have we not any plantoid?
Well, if you want to fly,
it's good that you look at birds --
to be inspired by birds.
But if you want to explore soils,
or if you want to colonize
new territory,
to best thing that you can do is to be inspired by plants
that are masters in doing this.
We have another possibility
we are working [on] in our lab,
[which] is to build hybrids.
It's much more easy to build hybrids.
Hybrid means it's something
that's half living and half machine.
It's much more easy to work with plants
than with animals.
They have computing power,
they have electrical signals.
The connection with the machine is much more easy,
much more even ethically possible.
And these are three possibilities
that we are working on
to build hybrids,
driven by algae
or by the leaves at the end,
by the most, most powerful parts of the plants,
by the roots.
And before I finish,
I would like to reassure that no snails were harmed
in making this presentation.
Thank you.
I want to talk to you today about prosperity,
about our hopes
for a shared and lasting prosperity.
And not just us,
but the two billion people worldwide
who are still chronically undernourished.
And hope actually is at the heart of this.
In fact, the Latin word for hope
is at the heart of the word prosperity.
"Pro-speras," "speras," hope --
in accordance with our hopes and expectations.
The irony is, though,
that we have cashed-out prosperity
almost literally in terms of money and economic growth.
And we've grown our economies so much
that we now stand
in a real danger
of undermining hope --
running down resources, cutting down rainforests,
spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico,
changing the climate --
and the only thing that has actually
remotely slowed down the relentless rise
of carbon emissions over the last two to three decades
is recession.
And recession, of course,
isn't exactly a recipe for hope either,
as we're busy finding out.
So we're caught in a kind of trap.
It's a dilemma, a dilemma of growth.
We can't live with it; we can't live without it.
Trash the system or crash the planet --
it's a tough choice; it isn't much of a choice.
And our best avenue of escape from this actually
is a kind of blind faith
in our own cleverness and technology and efficiency
and doing things more efficiently.
Now I haven't got anything against efficiency.
And I think we are a clever species sometimes.
But I think we should also just check the numbers,
take a reality check here.
in 2050, of around nine billion people,
all aspiring to Western incomes,
Western lifestyles.
And I want to ask the question --
and we'll give them that two percent hike in income, in salary each year as well,
because we believe in growth.
And I want to ask the question:
how far and how fast would be have to move?
How clever would we have to be?
How much technology would we need in this world
to deliver our carbon targets?
And here in my chart --
on the left-hand side is where we are now.
This is the carbon intensity of economic growth
in the economy at the moment.
It's around about 770 grams of carbon.
In the world I describe to you,
we have to be right over here at the right-hand side
at six grams of carbon.
It's a 130-fold improvement,
and that is 10 times further and faster
than anything we've ever achieved in industrial history.
Maybe we can do it, maybe it's possible -- who knows?
Maybe we can even go further
and get an economy that pulls carbon out of the atmosphere,
which is what we're going to need to be doing
by the end of the century.
But shouldn't we just check first
that the economic system that we have
is remotely capable of delivering
this kind of improvement?
It's a bit complex, and I apologize for that.
What I'll try and do, is I'll try and paraphrase it
is sort of human terms.
So it looks a little bit like this.
Firms produce goods for households -- that's us --
and provide us with incomes,
and that's even better, because we can spend those incomes
on more goods and services.
That's called the circular flow of the economy.
It looks harmless enough.
I just want to highlight one key feature of this system,
which is the role of investment.
Now investment constitutes
only about a fifth of the national income
in most modern economies,
but it plays an absolutely vital role.
And what it does essentially
is to stimulate further consumption growth.
It does this in a couple of ways --
chasing productivity,
which drives down prices and encourages us to buy more stuff.
But I want to concentrate
on the role of investment
in seeking out novelty,
the production and consumption of novelty.
Joseph Schumpeter called this
"the process of creative destruction."
It's a process of the production and reproduction of novelty,
continually chasing expanding consumer markets,
consumer goods, new consumer goods.
because it turns out that human beings
have something of an appetite for novelty.
We love new stuff --
new material stuff for sure --
but also new ideas, new adventures,
new experiences.
But the materiality matters too,
because in every society
that anthropologists have looked at,
material stuff
operates as a kind of language --
a language of goods,
a symbolic language
that we use to tell each other stories --
stories, for example,
about how important we are.
Status-driven, conspicuous consumption
thrives from the language
of novelty.
And here, all of a sudden,
we have a system
that is locking economic structure with social logic --
the economic institutions, and who we are as people, locked together
to drive an engine of growth.
And this engine is not just economic value;
it is pulling material resources
relentlessly through the system,
driven by our own insatiable appetites,
driven in fact by a sense of anxiety.
Adam Smith, 200 years ago,
spoke about our desire
for a life without shame.
A life without shame:
in his day, what that meant was a linen shirt,
and today, well, you still need the shirt,
but you need the hybrid car,
the HDTV, two holidays a year in the sun,
the netbook and iPad, the list goes on --
an almost inexhaustible supply of goods,
driven by this anxiety.
And even if we don't want them,
we need to buy them,
because, if we don't buy them, the system crashes.
And to stop it crashing
over the last two to three decades,
we've expanded the money supply,
expanded credit and debt,
so that people can keep buying stuff.
And of course, that expansion was deeply implicated in the crisis.
This is what it looks like, essentially,
this credit and debt system, just for the U.K.
This was the last 15 years before the crash,
and you can see there, consumer debt rose dramatically.
It was above the GDP for three years in a row
just before the crisis.
And in the mean time, personal savings absolutely plummeted.
The savings ratio, net savings,
were below zero in the middle of 2008,
just before the crash.
This is people expanding debt, drawing down their savings,
just to stay in the game.
This is a strange, rather perverse, story,
just to put it in very simple terms.
It's a story about us, people,
being persuaded
to spend money we don't have
on things we don't need
to create impressions that won't last
on people we don't care about.
maybe we should just go back and say, "Did we get this right?
Is this really how people are?
Is this really how economies behave?"
And almost straightaway
we actually run up against a couple of anomalies.
The first one is in the crisis itself.
In the crisis, in the recession, what do people want to do?
They want to hunker down, they want to look to the future.
They want to spend less and save more.
But saving is exactly the wrong thing to do
from the system point of view.
Keynes called this the "paradox of thrift" --
saving slows down recovery.
And politicians call on us continually
to draw down more debt,
to draw down our own savings even further,
just so that we can get the show back on the road,
so we can keep this growth-based economy going.
It's an anomaly,
it's a place where the system actually is at odds
with who we are as people.
Why is it
that we don't do the blindingly obvious things we should do
to combat climate change,
very, very simple things
like buying energy-efficient appliances,
putting in efficient lights, turning the lights off occasionally,
insulating our homes?
These things save carbon, they save energy,
they save us money.
So is it that, though they make perfect economic sense,
we don't do them?
Well, I had my own personal insight into this
a few years ago.
It was a Sunday evening, Sunday afternoon,
and it was just after --
actually, to be honest, too long after --
we had moved into a new house.
And I had finally got around to doing some draft stripping,
installing insulation around the windows and doors
to keep out the drafts.
And my, then, five year-old daughter
was helping me in the way that five year-olds do.
And we'd been doing this for a while,
when she turned to me very solemnly and said,
"Will this really keep out the giraffes?"
(Laughter)
"Here they are, the giraffes."
You can hear the five-year-old mind working.
These ones, interestingly, are 400 miles north of here
outside Barrow-in-Furness in Cumbria.
Goodness knows what they make of the Lake District weather.
But actually that childish misrepresentation
stuck with me,
because it suddenly became clear to me
why we don't do the blindingly obvious things.
We're too busy keeping out the giraffes --
putting the kids on the bus in the morning,
getting ourselves to work on time,
surviving email overload
and shop floor politics,
foraging for groceries, throwing together meals,
escaping for a couple of precious hours in the evening
into prime-time TV
or TED online,
getting from one end of the day to the other,
keeping out the giraffes.
"What is the objective of the consumer?"
Mary Douglas asked in an essay on poverty
written 35 years ago.
"It is," she said,
"to help create the social world
and find a credible place in it."
That is a deeply humanizing
vision of our lives,
and it's a completely different vision
than the one that lies at the heart
of this economic model.
So who are we?
Who are these people?
Are we these novelty-seeking, hedonistic,
selfish individuals?
Or might we actually occasionally be
something like the selfless altruist
depicted in Rembrandt's lovely, lovely sketch here?
Well psychology actually says
there is a tension --
a tension between self-regarding behaviors
and other regarding behaviors.
And these tensions have deep evolutionary roots,
so selfish behavior
is adaptive in certain circumstances --
fight or flight.
are essential to our evolution
as social beings.
And perhaps even more interesting from our point of view,
another tension between novelty-seeking behaviors
and tradition or conservation.
Novelty is adaptive when things are changing
and you need to adapt yourself.
Tradition is essential to lay down the stability
to raise families and form cohesive social groups.
So here, all of a sudden,
we're looking at a map of the human heart.
And it reveals to us, suddenly,
the crux of the matter.
What we've done is we've created economies.
We've created systems,
which systematically privilege, encourage,
one narrow quadrant
of the human soul
and left the others unregarded.
And in the same token, the solution becomes clear,
because this isn't, therefore,
about changing human nature.
It isn't, in fact, about curtailing possibilities.
It is about opening up.
It is about allowing ourselves the freedom
to become fully human,
recognizing the depth and the breadth
of the human psyche
and building institutions
to protect Rembrandt's fragile altruist within.
What would economies look like
if we took that vision of human nature
at their heart
and stretched them
along these orthogonal dimensions
of the human psyche?
Well, it might look a little bit
like the 4,000 community-interest companies
that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years
and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States,
enterprises
that have ecological and social goals
written into their constitution
at their heart --
companies, in fact, like this one, Ecosia.
And I just want to, very quickly, show you this.
Ecosia is an Internet search engine.
Internet search engines work
by drawing revenues from sponsored links
that appear when you do a search.
And Ecosia works in pretty much the same way.
So we can do that here --
we can just put in a little search term.
There you go, Oxford, that's where we are. See what comes up.
The difference with Ecosia though
is that, in Ecosia's case,
it draws the revenues in the same way,
but it allocates
80 percent of those revenues
to a rainforest protection project in the Amazon.
And we're going to do it.
We're just going to click on Naturejobs.uk.
In case anyone out there is looking for a job in a recession,
that's the page to go to.
And what happened then was
the sponsor gave revenues to Ecosia,
and Ecosia is giving 80 percent of those revenues
to a rainforest protection project.
It's taking profits from one place
and allocating them
into the protection of ecological resources.
for a new economy.
It's a form, if you like,
of ecological altruism --
perhaps something along those lines. Maybe it's that.
Whatever it is,
whatever this new economy is,
what we need the economy to do, in fact,
is to put investment
back into the heart of the model,
to re-conceive investment.
Only now, investment
isn't going to be
about the relentless and mindless
pursuit of consumption growth.
Investment has to be a different beast.
Investment has to be,
in the new economy,
protecting and nurturing
the ecological assets on which our future depends.
It has to be about transition.
It has to be investing in low-carbon technologies
and infrastructures.
We have to invest, in fact,
in the idea of a meaningful prosperity,
providing capabilities
for people to flourish.
It would be nonsense to talk about people flourishing
if they didn't have food, clothing and shelter.
But it's also clear that prosperity goes beyond this.
It has social and psychological aims --
family, friendship,
commitments, society,
participating in the life of that society.
And this too
requires investment,
investment -- for example, in places --
places where we can connect,
places where we can participate,
shared spaces,
concert halls, gardens,
public parks,
libraries, museums, quiet centers,
places of joy and celebration,
places of tranquility and contemplation,
sites for the "cultivation
of a common citizenship,"
in Michael Sandel's lovely phrase.
An investment -- investment, after all, is just such a basic economic concept --
is nothing more nor less
than a relationship
between the present and the future,
a shared present and a common future.
And we need that relationship to reflect,
to reclaim hope.
to the two billion people
still trying to live each day
on less than the price of a skinny latte
from the cafe next door.
What can we offer those people?
It's clear that we have a responsibility
to help lift them out of poverty.
It's clear that we have a responsibility
to make room for growth
where growth really matters in those poorest nations.
And it's also clear that we will never achieve that
unless we're capable of redefining
a meaningful sense of prosperity in the richer nations,
a prosperity that is more meaningful
and less materialistic
than the growth-based model.
So this is not just
a Western post-materialist fantasy.
In fact, an African philosopher wrote to me,
when "Prosperity Without Growth" was published,
pointing out the similarities
between this view of prosperity
and the traditional African concept of ubuntu.
Ubuntu says, "I am
because we are."
Prosperity is a shared endeavor.
Its roots are long and deep --
its foundations, I've tried to show,
exist already, inside each of us.
So this is not about
standing in the way of development.
It's not about
overthrowing capitalism.
It's not about
trying to change human nature.
What we're doing here
is we're taking a few simple steps
towards an economics fit for purpose.
And at the heart of that economics,
we're placing a more credible,
more robust,
and more realistic vision
of what it means to be human.
First of all, economists aren't supposed to be inspiring,
so you may need to work on the tone a little.
(Laughter)
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this?
I mean, can you picture
a politician standing up in Britain and saying,
"GDP fell two percent this year. Good news!
We're actually all happier, and a country's more beautiful,
and our lives are better."
You're not making news out of things falling down.
You're making news out of the things that tell you that we're flourishing.
Can I picture politicians doing it?
Actually, I already am seeing a little bit of it.
When we first started this kind of work,
politicians would stand up, treasury spokesmen would stand up,
and accuse us of wanting to go back and live in caves.
And actually in the period
through which we've been working over the last 18 years --
partly because of the financial crisis
and a little bit of humility in the profession of economics --
actually people are engaging in this issue
in all sorts of countries around the world.
or is it going to be more just civil society and companies?
But it has to have political leadership.
This is a kind of agenda,
which actually politicians themselves
are kind of caught in that dilemma,
because they're hooked on the growth model themselves.
But actually opening up the space
to think about different ways of governing,
different kinds of politics,
and creating the space
for civil society and businesses to operate differently --
absolutely vital.
that we actually can make the -- what was it? --
the 130-fold improvement in efficiency,
of reduction of carbon footprint,
would you then actually like that picture of economic growth
into more knowledge-based goods?
and get below zero by the end of the century,
in terms of taking carbon out of the atmosphere,
and solve the problem of biodiversity
and reduce the impact on land use
and do something about the erosion of topsoils and the quality of water.
If you can convince me we can do all that,
then, yes, I would take the two percent.
Welcome to Thailand.
Now, when I was a young man -- 40 years ago,
the country was very, very poor
with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty.
We decided to do something about it,
but we didn't begin with a welfare program
or a poverty reduction program.
But we began with a family-planning program,
following a very successful
maternal child health activity,
sets of activities.
So basically, no one would accept family planning
if their children didn't survive.
So the first step: get to the children, get to the mothers,
and then follow up with family planning.
Not just child mortality alone, you need also family planning.
Now let me take you back
as to why we needed to do it.
Seven children per family --
tremendous growth at 3.3 percent.
There was just no future.
We needed to reduce the population growth rate.
So we said, "Let's do it."
The women said, "We agree. We'll use pills,
but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills,"
and we had very, very few doctors.
We didn't take no as an answer;
we took no as a question.
We went to the nurses and the midwives, who were also women,
and did a fantastic job
at explaining how to use the pill.
That was wonderful,
but it covered only 20 percent of the country.
leave them alone and say, "Well, they're not medical personnel."
No, we decided to do a bit more.
So we went to the ordinary people that you saw.
Actually, below that yellow sign --
I wish they hadn't wiped that,
because there was "Coca-Cola" there.
We were so much bigger than Coca-Cola in those days.
And no difference,
the people they chose were the people we chose.
They were well-known in the community,
they knew that customers were always right,
and they were terrific, and they practiced their family planning themselves.
So they could supply pills and condoms
throughout the country, in every village of the country.
So there we are. We went to the people
who were seen as the cause of the problem
to be the solution.
Wherever there were people --
and you can see boats with the women, selling things --
here's the floating market
selling bananas and crabs
and also contraceptives --
wherever you find people,
you'll find contraceptives in Thailand.
because in the Philippines,
the Catholic Church was pretty strong,
and Thai people were Buddhist.
We went to them and they said, "Look, could you help us?"
I'm there -- the one in blue, not the yellow --
holding a bowl of holy water
for the monk to sprinkle holy water
on pills and condoms
for the sanctity of the family.
And this picture was sent throughout the country.
So some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves.
And the women were saying, "No wonder we have no side-effects.
It's been blessed."
That was their perception.
You need everybody to be involved
in trying to provide whatever it is
that make humanity a better place.
So we went to the teachers.
Over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning
with a new alphabet -- A, B for birth, C for condom,
I for IUD, V for vasectomy.
And then we had a snakes and ladders game, where you throw dice.
If you land on anything pro-family planning, you move ahead.
Like, "Mother takes the pill every night.
Very good, mother. Move ahead.
Uncle buys a condom. Very good, uncle. Move ahead.
Uncle gets drunk, doesn't use condom. Come back, start again."
(Laughter)
Again, education, class entertainment.
And the kids were doing it in school too.
We had relay races with condoms,
we had children's condom-blowing championship.
And before long,
the condom was know as the girl's best friend.
In Thailand, for poor people, diamonds don't make it --
so the condom is the girl's best friend.
and the women who organized it said,
"We only want to lend
to women who practice family planning.
If you're pregnant, take care of your pregnancy.
If you're not pregnant, you can take a loan out from us."
And that was run by them.
And after 35/36 years,
it's still going on.
It's a part of the Village Development Bank;
it's not a real bank, but it's a fund -- microcredit.
And we didn't need a big organization to run it --
it was run by the villagers themselves.
And you probably hardly see a Thai man there,
it's always women, women, women, women.
And then we thought we'd help America,
because America's been helping everyone,
whether they want help or not.
(Laughter)
And this is on the Fourth of July.
We decided to provide vasectomy to all men,
but in particular, American men to the front of the queue,
right up to the Ambassador's residence
during his vin d'honneur.
And the hotel gave us the ballroom for it --
very appropriate room.
(Laughter)
And since it was near lunch time,
they said, "All right, we'll give you some lunch.
Of course, it must be American cola.
You get two brands, Coke and Pepsi.
And then the food is either hamburger or hotdog."
And I thought a hotdog will be more symbolic.
(Laughter)
And here is this, then, young man called Willy Bohm
who worked for the USAID.
Obviously, he's had his vasectomy
because his hotdog is half eaten, and he was very happy.
It made a lot of news in America, and it angered some people also.
I said, "Don't worry. Come over and I'll do the whole lot of you."
In all this thing,
from seven children to 1.5 children,
population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5.
You could call it the Coca-Cola approach if you like --
it was exactly the same thing.
I'm not sure whether Coca-Cola followed us, or we followed Coca-Cola,
but we're good friends.
And so that's the case of everyone joining in.
We didn't have a strong government. We didn't have lots of doctors.
But it's everybody's job
who can change attitude and behavior.
and we had to stop doing a lot of good things
to fight AIDS.
But unfortunately, the government was in denial, denial, denial.
So our work wasn't affected.
So I thought, "Well, if you can't go to the government, go to the military."
So I went to the military
and asked to borrow 300 radio stations.
They have more than the government,
and they've got more guns than the government.
So I asked them, could they help us
in our fight against HIV.
And after I gave them statistics,
they said, "Yes. Okay. You can use all the radio stations, television stations."
And that's when we went onto the airwaves.
And then we got a new prime minister soon after that.
And he said, "Mechai, could you come and join?"
He asked me in because he liked my wife a lot.
So I said, "Okay."
He became the chairman of the National AIDS Committee
and increased the budget fifty-fold.
everyone -- and we said the public, institutions,
religious institutions, schools --
everyone was involved.
And here, every media person
had to be trained for HIV.
And we gave every station half a minute extra
for advertising to earn more money.
So they were happy with that.
And then AIDS education in all schools,
starting from university.
And these are high school kids teaching high school kids.
And the best teachers were the girls, not the boys,
and they were terrific.
And these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and HIV
were known as Mother Theresa.
And then we went down one more step.
These are primary school kids -- third, fourth grade --
going to every household in the village,
every household in the whole of Thailand,
giving AIDS information and a condom
to every household,
given by these young kids.
And no parents objected, because we were trying to save lives,
and this was a lifesaver.
And we said, "Everyone needs to be involved."
that sick staff don't work, and dead customers don't buy.
So they all trained.
And then we have this Captain Condom,
with his Harvard MBA,
going to schools and night spots.
And they loved him. You need a symbol of something.
In every country, every program, you need a symbol,
and this is probably the best thing he's ever done with his MBA.
(Laughter)
And then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets --
everywhere, everywhere.
In taxis, you get condoms.
And also, in traffic,
the policemen give you condoms -- our "cops and rubbers" programs.
(Laughter)
So, can you imagine New York policemen giving out condoms?
Of course I can. And they'd enjoy it immensely;
I see them standing around right now, everywhere.
Imagine if they had condoms,
giving out to all sorts of people.
And then, new change,
we had hair bands, clothing
and the condom for your mobile phone
during the rainy season.
One says, "Weapon of mass protection."
We found --
you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction,
but we have found the weapon of mass protection: the condom.
And then it says here, with the American flag,
"Don't leave home without it."
But I have some to give out afterward.
But let me warn you, these are Thai-sized,
so be very careful.
(Laughter)
And so you can see
that condoms can do so many things.
Look at this --
I gave this to Al Gore and to Bill Senior also.
Stop global warming; use condoms.
And then this is the picture I mentioned to you --
the weapon of mass protection.
And let the next Olympics save some lives.
Why just run around?
(Laughter)
And then finally,
in Thailand we're Buddhist, we don't have a God,
so instead, we say, "In rubber we trust."
(Laughter)
So you can see that we added everything to our endeavor
to make life better for the people.
We had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools,
because alcohol impairs judgment.
After all this time, everybody joined in.
According to the U.N.,
new cases of HIV
declined by 90 percent,
and according to the World Bank,
7.7 million lives were saved.
Otherwise there wouldn't be many Thais walking around today.
So it just showed you, you could do something about it.
90 percent of the funding came from Thailand.
There was political commitment, some financial commitment,
and everybody joined in the fight.
So just don't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses.
We all need to help.
now that we got AIDS somewhat out of the way --
this time, not with government alone,
but in cooperation with the business community.
Because poor people are business people
who lack business skills and access to credit.
Those are the things to be provided by the business community.
We're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs,
little business people.
The only way out of poverty is through business enterprise.
So, that was done.
The money goes from the company into the village
via tree-planting.
It's not a free gift.
They plant the trees, and the money goes into their microcredit fund,
which we call the Village Development Bank.
Everybody joins in,
and they feel they own the bank,
because they have brought the money in.
And we believe if you want to help the poor,
those who are living in poverty,
access to credit must be a human right.
Access to credit must be a human right.
Otherwise they'll never get out of poverty.
And then before getting a loan, you must be trained.
Here's what we call a "barefoot MBA,"
teaching people how to do business
so that, when they borrow money, they'll succeed with the business.
These are some of the businesses:
mushrooms, crabs, vegetables,
trees, fruits,
and this is very interesting -- Nike ice cream and Nike biscuits;
this is a village sponsored by Nike.
They said, "They should stop making shoes and clothes.
Make these better, because we can afford them."
And then we have silk, Thai silk.
Now we're making Scottish tartans, as you can see on the left,
to sell to all people of Scottish ancestors.
So anyone sitting in and watching TV,
get in touch with me.
And then this is our answer to Starbucks in Thailand --
"Coffee and Condoms."
See, Starbucks you awake, we keep you awake and alive.
That's the difference.
Can you imagine, at every Starbucks
that you can also get condoms?
You can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino.
we want to change the school as being underutilized
into a place where it's a lifelong learning center for everyone.
We call this our School-Based Integrated Rural Development.
And it's a center, a focal point
for economic and social development.
Re-do the school,
make it serve the community needs.
And here is a bamboo building --
all of them are bamboo.
This is a geodesic dome made of bamboo.
And I'm sure Buckminster Fuller would be very, very proud
to see a bamboo geodesic dome.
And we use vegetables around the school ground,
so they raise their own vegetables.
if we want the MDGs to work --
the Millennium Development Goals --
we need to add family planning to it.
Of course, child mortality first and then family planning --
everyone needs family planning service --
it's underutilized.
So we have now found the weapon of mass protection.
And we also ask the next Olympics
to be involved in saving lives.
And then, finally, that is our network.
And these are our Thai tulips.
Imagine, if you will -- a gift.
I'd like for you to picture it in your mind.
It's not too big --
about the size of a golf ball.
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up.
But before I show you what's inside,
I will tell you, it's going to do incredible things for you.
It will bring all of your family together.
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before
and reconnect with friends and acquaintances
you haven't heard from in years.
Adoration and admiration
will overwhelm you.
It will recalibrate what's most important in your life.
of spirituality and faith.
You'll have a new understanding
and trust in your body.
You'll have unsurpassed vitality and energy.
You'll expand your vocabulary,
meet new people,
and you'll have a healthier lifestyle.
And get this --
you'll have an eight-week vacation
of doing absolutely nothing.
You'll eat countless gourmet meals.
Flowers will arrive by the truckload.
People will say to you,
"You look great. Have you had any work done?"
And you'll have a lifetime supply
of good drugs.
motivated and humbled.
Your life will have new meaning.
Peace, health,
serenity, happiness,
nirvana.
The price?
$55,000,
and that's an incredible deal.
what it is and where you can get one.
Does Amazon carry it?
Does it have the Apple logo on it?
Is there a waiting list?
Not likely.
This gift came to me about five months ago.
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up --
not quite so pretty.
And this,
and then this.
It was a rare gem --
a brain tumor,
hemangioblastoma --
the gift that keeps on giving.
I wouldn't wish this gift for you.
I'm not sure you'd want it.
But I wouldn't change my experience.
It profoundly altered my life
in ways I didn't expect
in all the ways I just shared with you.
with something that's unexpected,
unwanted and uncertain,
consider
that it just may be a gift.
So, I'd like to spend a few minutes with you folks today
imagining what our planet might look like in a thousand years.
But before I do that,
I need to talk to you about synthetic materials like plastics,
which require huge amounts of energy to create
and, because of their disposal issues,
are slowly poisoning our planet.
I also want to tell you and share with you
how my team and I
have been using mushrooms over the last three years.
Not like that. (Laughter)
We're using mushrooms to create an entirely new class of materials,
which perform a lot like plastics during their use,
but are made from crop waste
and are totally compostable at the end of their lives.
I need to talk to you about what I consider one of the most egregious offenders
in the disposable plastics category.
This is a material you all know is Styrofoam,
but I like to think of it as toxic white stuff.
In a single cubic foot of this material --
about what would come around your computer or large television --
you have the same energy content
of about a liter and a half of petrol.
Yet, after just a few weeks of use,
you'll throw this material in the trash.
And this isn't just found in packaging.
20 billion dollars of this material is produced every year,
in everything from building materials to surfboards
to coffee cups to table tops.
And that's not the only place it's found.
The EPA estimates, in the United States,
by volume, this material occupies 25 percent of our landfills.
Even worse is when it finds its way into our natural environment --
on the side of the road or next to a river.
If it's not picked up by a human, like me and you,
it'll stay there for thousands and thousands of years.
Perhaps even worse
is when it finds its way into our oceans, like in the great plastic gyre,
where these materials are being mechanically broken
into smaller and smaller bits,
but they're not really going away.
They're not biologically compatible.
They're basically fouling up
Earth's respiratory and circulatory systems.
And because these materials are so prolific,
because they're found in so many places,
there's one other place you'll find this material, styrene,
which is made from benzene, a known carcinogen.
You'll find it inside of you.
I think we need better materials,
and there are three key principles we can use to guide these materials.
The first is feedstocks.
Today, we use a single feedstock, petroleum,
to heat our homes, power our cars
and make most of the materials you see around you.
We recognize this is a finite resource,
and it's simply crazy to do this, to put a liter and a half of petrol in the trash
every time you get a package.
Second of all, we should really strive to use far less energy
in creating these materials.
I say far less, because 10 percent isn't going to cut it.
We should be talking about half, a quarter,
one-tenth the energy content.
And lastly, and I think perhaps most importantly,
we should be creating materials
that fit into what I call nature's recycling system.
This recycling system has been in place for the last billion years.
I fit into it, you fit into it,
and a hundred years tops, my body can return to the Earth with no preprocessing.
Yet that packaging I got in the mail yesterday
is going to last for thousands of years.
This is crazy.
When a tree's done using its leaves --
its solar collectors, these amazing molecular photon capturing devices --
at the end of a season,
it doesn't pack them up, take them to the leaf reprocessing center
and have them melted down to form new leaves.
It just drops them, the shortest distance possible,
to the forest floor,
where they're actually upcycled into next year's topsoil.
And this gets us back to the mushrooms.
Because in nature,
mushrooms are the recycling system.
And what we've discovered
is, by using a part of the mushroom you've probably never seen --
analogous to its root structure; it's called mycelium --
we can actually grow materials
with many of the same properties of conventional synthetics.
because it's a self-assembling material.
It actually takes things we would consider waste --
things like seed husks or woody biomass --
and can transform them into a chitinous polymer,
which you can form into almost any shape.
In our process,
we basically use it as a glue.
And by using mycelium as a glue,
you can mold things just like you do in the plastic industry,
and you can create materials with many different properties,
materials that are insulating, fire-resistant,
moisture-resistant, vapor-resistant --
materials that can absorb impacts, that can absorb acoustical impacts.
But these materials are grown from agricultural byproducts,
not petroleum.
And because they're made of natural materials,
they are 100 percent compostable
in you own backyard.
required to make these materials.
The first is selecting a feedstock,
preferably something that's regional, that's in your area, right --
local manufacturing.
The next is actually taking this feedstock and putting in a tool,
physically filling an enclosure, a mold,
in whatever shape you want to get.
Then you actually grow the mycelium through these particles,
and that's where the magic happens,
because the organism is doing the work in this process,
not the equipment.
The final step is, of course, the product,
whether it's a packaging material, a table top, or building block.
Our vision is local manufacturing,
like the local food movement, for production.
So we've created formulations for all around the world
using regional byproducts.
If you're in China, you might use a rice husk
or a cottonseed hull.
If you're in Northern Europe or North America,
you can use things like buckwheat husks or oat hulls.
We then process these husks with some basic equipment.
that gives you a sense of how this looks at scale.
So what you're seeing here is actually cotton hulls from Texas, in this case.
It's a waste product.
And what they're doing in our equipment
is going through a continuous system,
which cleans, cooks, cools
and pasteurizes these materials,
while also continuously inoculating them with our mycelium.
This gives us a continuous stream of material
that we can put into almost any shape,
though today we're making corner blocks.
And it's when this lid goes on the part,
that the magic really starts.
Because the manufacturing process is our organism.
It'll actually begin to digest these wastes
and, over the next five days,
assemble them into biocomposites.
Our entire facility
is comprised of thousands and thousands and thousands of these tools
sitting indoors in the dark, quietly self-assembling materials --
and everything from building materials
to, in this case,
a packaging corner block.
And it's kind of hard to picture how that happens.
So my team has taken five days-worth of growth,
a typical growth cycle for us,
and condensed it into a 15-second time lapse.
And I want you to really watch closely
these little white dots on the screen,
because, over the five-day period,
what they do is extend out and through this material,
using the energy that's contained in these seed husks
to build this chitinous polymer matrix.
This matrix self-assembles,
growing through and around the particles,
making millions and millions of tiny fibers.
And what parts of the seed husk we don't digest,
actually become part of the final, physical composite.
So in front of your eyes, this part just self-assembled.
It actually takes a little longer. It takes five days.
But it's much faster than conventional farming.
In this case, we've grown a corner block.
A major Fortune 500 furniture maker
uses these corner blocks to protect their tables in shipment.
They used to use a plastic packaging buffer,
but we were able to give them the exact same physical performance
with our grown material.
Best of all, when it gets to the customer,
it's not trash.
They can actually put this in their natural ecosystem without any processing,
and it's going to improve the local soil.
The first reason is local open feedstocks.
You want to be able to do this anywhere in the world
and not worry about peak rice hull or peak cottonseed hulls,
because you have multiple choices.
The next is self-assembly,
because the organism is actually doing most of the work in this process.
You don't need a lot of equipment to set up a production facility.
So you can have lots of small facilities
spread all across the world.
Biological yield is really important.
And because 100 percent of what we put in the tool become the final product,
even the parts that aren't digested
become part of the structure,
we're getting incredible yield rates.
because these polymers have been tried and tested
in our ecosystem for the last billion years,
in everything from mushrooms to crustaceans.
They're not going to clog up Earth's ecosystems. They work great.
And while, today,
we can practically guarantee that yesterday's packaging
is going to be here in 10,000 years,
what I want to guarantee
is that in 10,000 years,
our descendants, our children's children,
will be living happily and in harmony
with a healthy Earth.
And I think that can be some really good news.
So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --
about addressing
desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,
and what we have learned from it,
and how to help people
to overcome traumatic experiences
and how to help them to regain some confidence
in the time ahead -- in the future --
and how to participate again in everyday life.
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,
and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,
on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.
Jung in Afghanistan --
you get the picture.
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,
and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.
War and malnutrition kills people
together with hope.
You may know this from the media,
but what you may not know
is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,
which means they grow up in such an environment
and -- I repeat myself --
in 30 years of war.
into ongoing violence,
foreign interests, bribery,
drugs, ethnic conflicts,
bad health, shame, fear
and cumulative traumatic experiences.
Local and foreign military
are supposed to build peace together with the donors
and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.
And people had hope, yes,
but until they realized
their situation worsens every day --
either because they are being killed
or because, somehow,
they are poorer than eight years ago.
One figure for that:
54 percent of the children under the age of five years
suffer from malnutrition.
One day a man told me,
"My future does not look brilliant,
but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."
This is a picture I took in 2005,
walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,
and for me it's a symbolic picture
of an open future for a young generation.
And donors
are supposed to bring peace
by building schools and roads.
Military collect weapons,
and depression stays intact.
Why?
Because people don't have tools
to cope with it, to get over it.
So, soon after my arrival,
I had confirmed something which I had already known;
that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.
However, what can wound us
and our reaction to those wounds --
they are universal.
And the big challenge
was how to understand the meaning of the symptom
in this specific cultural context.
After a counseling session, a woman said to me,
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,
and I want to participate again
in my family life."
This was very important,
because the family is central
in Afghans' social system.
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,
because something horrible has happened to them,
then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,
and they do not dare to tell this evil
to other people or to their loved ones,
because they do not want to burden them.
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.
Traumatized people also easily lose control --
symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks --
so people are in a constant fear
that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event
might come back unexpectedly,
suddenly,
and they cannot control it.
To compensate this loss of inner control,
they try to control the outside,
very understandably -- mostly the family --
and unfortunately,
this fits very well
into the traditional side,
regressive side, repressive side,
restrictive side of the cultural context.
So, husbands start beating wives,
mothers and fathers beat their children,
and afterward, they feel awful.
They did not want to do this, it just happened --
they lost control.
The desperate try
to restore order and normality,
and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,
it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.
And partly this is already happening.
and the Afghan sense of the future
is shattered.
But let me repeat the words of the woman.
"Because you have felt me,
I can feel myself again."
So the key here is empathy.
Somebody has to be a witness
to what has happened to you.
Somebody has to feel how you felt.
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.
Everybody must be able
to know what he or she has experienced is true,
and this only goes with another person.
So everybody must be able to say,
"This happened to me, and it did this with me,
but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,
and to learn from it.
And I want to engage myself
in the bright future for my children
and the children of my children,
and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," --
what happens too often in Afghanistan.
even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.
And I started thinking about a counseling program.
But, of course, I needed help and funds.
And one evening,
I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,
and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.
And I explained to him quickly,
I would train psycho-social counselors,
I would open centers, and I explained to him why.
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening
and said, "If you want to do this, call me."
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.
and we trained 30 Afghan women and men,
and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted,
and we had 45 all over Kabul.
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.
And 70 percent regained their lives.
This was a very exciting time,
developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.
And they are working with me up to today.
We developed a culturally-sensitive
psycho-social counseling approach.
So, from 2008 up until today,
a substantial change and step forward
has been taking place.
came into this and hired me to work
inside the Ministry of Public Health,
to lobby this approach --
we succeeded.
We revised the mental health component
of the primary health care services
by adding psycho-social care
and psycho-social counselors to the system.
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.
But for that, we already have the training manuals,
which are approved by the Ministry
and moreover, this approach is now part
of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.
in some selected clinics in three provinces,
and you are the first to see the results.
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.
And here you can see
the patients all had symptoms of depression,
moderate and severe.
And the red line is the treatment as usual --
medication with a medical doctor.
And all the symptoms
stayed the same or even got worse.
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,
without medication.
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,
and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,
which is explicable,
because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,
but you can learn how to cope with them.
So this makes us very happy,
because now we also have some evidence
that this is working.
this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,
and every morning it looks like this all over.
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,
but now this will change.
They go to the clinics,
because they want to cure their immediate symptoms,
and they will find somebody to talk to
and discuss these issues
and talk about what is burdening them
and find solutions, develop their resources,
learn tools to solve their family conflicts
and gain some confidence in the future.
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,
"If we were to have met some years ago,
then we would have killed each other.
And now you are helping me
to regain some confidence in the future."
And another counselor said to me after the training,
"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,
but now I know,
because I am part of a nucleus
of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."
So I believe this kept me running.
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution
to peace and reconciliation.
And also -- I think --
without psycho-social therapy,
and without considering this
in all humanitarian projects,
we cannot build-up civil societies.
and I think it must be,
can be, could be replicated elsewhere.
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night.
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --
my blood pressure, 127 over 74.
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,
so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,
zero of alcohol.
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,
or the NPI-16,
is a reassuring 0.31.
when we advertise, manage, govern, search.
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,
learn, remember
and want to improve.
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I
noticed that people were subjecting themselves
to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking
that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits
such as stepping on a scale every day.
People were tracking their food via Twitter,
their kids' diapers on their iPhone.
They were making detailed journals
of their spending, their mood,
their symptoms, their treatments.
that are driving this change in our lifestyle --
the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,
the exponential improvement in data storage
and data processing,
and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.
This little black dot there
is a 3D accelerometer.
It tracks your movement through space.
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece,
and they're going into all kinds of devices.
But what's interesting
is the incredible detailed information that you can get
from just one sensor like this.
This kind of sensor
is in the hit biometric device --
among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.
It has just that sensor in it.
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.
It's really just a pressure sensor
like the kind that's in a doorbell.
And Nike knows how to get
your pace and distance from just that sensor.
This is the strap
that people use to transmit heart-rate data
to their Nike+ system.
that gives you detailed sleep tracking data,
not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep --
deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.
The rest of it is the bedside console;
just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago --
I mean, really until now.
And this is the sleep tracking system of today.
at a health care conference in D.C.
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,
but the top is a very small GPS transceiver,
which gives you the date and location
of an asthma incident,
giving you a new awareness
of your vulnerability
in relation to time and environmental factors.
are changing our sense of self in the world --
these tiny sensors that gather data in nature,
the ubiquitous computing
that allows that data to be understood and used,
and of course the social networks
that allow people to collaborate and contribute.
But we think of these tools as pointing outward,
as windows
and I'd just like to invite you to think of them
as also turning inward
and becoming mirrors.
So that when we think about using them
to get some systematic improvement,
we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,
for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.
a pair of Apple Earbuds.
Last year, Apple filed some patents
to get blood oxygenation,
heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.
What is this for?
What should it be for?
Some people will say it's for biometric security.
Some people will say it's for public health research.
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.
I'd like to tell you
that it's also for self-knowledge.
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.
The self is just our operation center,
our consciousness,
our moral compass.
So, if we want to act
more effectively in the world,
we have to get to know ourselves better.
We live in in a remarkable time,
the age of genomics.
Your genome is the entire sequence of your DNA.
Your sequence and mine are slightly different.
That's why we look different.
I've got brown eyes;
you might have blue or gray.
But it's not just skin-deep.
The headlines tell us
that genes can give us scary diseases,
maybe even shape our personality,
or give us mental disorders.
Our genes seem to have
awesome power over our destinies.
And yet, I would like to think
that I am more than my genes.
What do you guys think?
Are you more than your genes?
(Audience: Yes.) Yes?
I think we should make a statement.
I think we should say it all together.
All right: "I'm more than my genes" -- all together.
Everybody: I am more than my genes.
(Cheering)
Sebastian Seung: What am I?
(Laughter)
I am my connectome.
Now, since you guys are really great,
Right. All together now.
Everybody: I am my connectome.
SS: That sounded great.
You know, you guys are so great, you don't even know what a connectome is,
that of this tiny worm.
Its modest nervous system
consists of just 300 neurons.
And in the 1970s and '80s,
a team of scientists
mapped all 7,000 connections
between the neurons.
In this diagram, every node is a neuron,
and every line is a connection.
This is the connectome
of the worm C. elegans.
Your connectome is far more complex than this
because your brain
contains 100 billion neurons
and 10,000 times as many connections.
There's a diagram like this for your brain,
but there's no way it would fit on this slide.
Your connectome contains one million times more connections
than your genome has letters.
That's a lot of information.
We don't know for sure, but there are theories.
Since the 19th century, neuroscientists have speculated
that maybe your memories --
the information that makes you, you --
maybe your memories are stored
maybe your personality and your intellect --
maybe they're also encoded
in the connections between your neurons.
And so now you can see why I proposed this hypothesis:
I am my connectome.
I didn't ask you to chant it because it's true;
because we have never had technologies
powerful enough to test it.
Finding that worm connectome
took over a dozen years of tedious labor.
And to find the connectomes of brains more like our own,
we need more sophisticated technologies, that are automated,
that will speed up the process of finding connectomes.
And in the next few minutes, I'll tell you about some of these technologies,
which are currently under development
in my lab and the labs of my collaborators.
You can recognize them instantly
by their fantastic shapes.
They extend long and delicate branches,
and in short, they look like trees.
But this is just a single neuron.
In order to find connectomes,
we have to see all the neurons at the same time.
So let's meet Bobby Kasthuri,
Bobby is holding fantastically thin slices
of a mouse brain.
And we're zooming in by a factor of 100,000 times
to obtain the resolution,
so that we can see the branches of neurons all at the same time.
Except, you still may not really recognize them,
and that's because we have to work in three dimensions.
and stack them up,
we get a three-dimensional image.
And still, you may not see the branches.
So we start at the top,
and we color in the cross-section of one branch in red,
And we keep on doing that,
slice after slice.
If we continue through the entire stack,
we can reconstruct the three-dimensional shape
of a small fragment of a branch of a neuron.
And we can do that for another neuron in green.
And you can see that the green neuron touches the red neuron
at two locations,
and these are what are called synapses.
and keep your eyes on the interior of the green neuron.
You should see small circles --
these are called vesicles.
They contain a molecule know as a neurotransmitter.
And so when the green neuron wants to communicate,
it wants to send a message to the red neuron,
it spits out neurotransmitter.
At the synapse, the two neurons
are said to be connected
like two friends talking on the telephone.
How can we find an entire connectome?
Well, we take this three-dimensional stack of images
and treat it as a gigantic three-dimensional coloring book.
We color every neuron in, in a different color,
and then we look through all of the images,
find the synapses
and note the colors of the two neurons involved in each synapse.
If we can do that throughout all the images,
we could find a connectome.
you've learned the basics of neurons and synapses.
how are the brains of men and women different?
(Laughter)
According to this self-help book,
guys brains are like waffles;
they keep their lives compartmentalized in boxes.
Girls' brains are like spaghetti;
everything in their life is connected to everything else.
(Laughter)
You guys are laughing,
but you know, this book changed my life.
(Laughter)
But seriously, what's wrong with this?
everyone's brains are like spaghetti.
Or maybe really, really fine capellini with branches.
Just as one strand of spaghetti
contacts many other strands on your plate,
one neuron touches many other neurons
through their entangled branches.
One neuron can be connected to so many other neurons,
because there can be synapses
at these points of contact.
By now, you might have sort of lost perspective
on how large this cube of brain tissue actually is.
I assure you, this is very tiny. It's just six microns on a side.
So, here's how it stacks up against an entire neuron.
And you can tell that, really, only the smallest fragments of branches
are contained inside this cube.
And a neuron, well, that's smaller than brain.
And that's just a mouse brain --
it's a lot smaller than a human brain.
So when show my friends this,
sometimes they've told me,
"You know, Sebastian, you should just give up.
Neuroscience is hopeless."
Because if you look at a brain with your naked eye,
you don't really see how complex it is,
but when you use a microscope,
finally the hidden complexity is revealed.
the mathematician and philosopher, Blaise Pascal,
wrote of his dread of the infinite,
his feeling of insignificance
at contemplating the vast reaches of outer space.
And, as a scientist,
I'm not supposed to talk about my feelings --
too much information, professor.
(Laughter)
But may I?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I feel curiosity,
and I feel wonder,
but at times I have also felt despair.
Why did I choose to study
this organ that is so awesome in its complexity
that it might well be infinite?
It's absurd.
How could we even dare to think
that we might ever understand this?
And indeed, these days I harbor new hopes.
Someday,
a fleet of microscopes will capture
every neuron and every synapse
in a vast database of images.
And some day, artificially intelligent supercomputers
will analyze the images without human assistance
to summarize them in a connectome.
I do not know, but I hope that I will live to see that day,
because finding an entire human connectome
just to find partial connectomes
of tiny chunks of mouse and human brain.
For now, let me try to convince you of the plausibility of this hypothesis,
that it's actually worth taking seriously.
and age during adulthood,
your personal identity changes slowly.
Likewise, every connectome
changes over time.
What kinds of changes happen?
Well, neurons, like trees,
can grow new branches,
and they can lose old ones.
Synapses can be created,
and they can be eliminated.
Second question:
what causes these changes?
Well, it's true.
To some extent, they are programmed by your genes.
But that's not the whole story,
because there are signals, electrical signals,
that travel along the branches of neurons
and chemical signals
that jump across from branch to branch.
These signals are called neural activity.
And there's a lot of evidence
that neural activity
is encoding our thoughts, feelings and perceptions,
our mental experiences.
And there's a lot of evidence that neural activity
can cause your connections to change.
And if you put those two facts together,
it means that your experiences
The connectome is where nature meets nurture.
And it might true
that just the mere act of thinking
can change your connectome --
an idea that you may find empowering.
A cool and refreshing stream of water, you say.
What else is in this picture?
Do not forget that groove in the Earth
called the stream bed.
Without it, the water would not know in which direction to flow.
And with the stream,
I would like to propose a metaphor
for the relationship between neural activity
and connectivity.
Neural activity is constantly changing.
It's like the water of the stream; it never sits still.
The connections
of the brain's neural network
determines the pathways
along which neural activity flows.
And so the connectome is like bed of the stream;
but the metaphor is richer than that,
because it's true that the stream bed
guides the flow of the water,
but over long timescales,
the water also reshapes the bed of the stream.
And as I told you just now,
neural activity can change the connectome.
And if you'll allow me to ascend
of thoughts, feelings and perceptions.
And so we might even speak of
the stream of consciousness.
Neural activity is its water,
and the connectome is its bed.
and return to science.
Suppose our technologies for finding connectomes
actually work.
Well, I propose a direct test.
Let us attempt
to read out memories from connectomes.
Consider the memory
of long temporal sequences of movements,
like a pianist playing a Beethoven sonata.
According to a theory that dates back to the 19th century,
such memories are stored
as chains of synaptic connections inside your brain.
and so on down the line,
like a chain of falling dominoes.
And this sequence of neural activation
is hypothesized to be the neural basis
of those sequence of movements.
is to look for such chains
inside connectomes.
But it won't be easy, because they're not going to look like this.
They're going to be scrambled up.
So we'll have to use our computers
to try to unscramble the chain.
And if we can do that,
the sequence of the neurons we recover from that unscrambling
will be a prediction of the pattern of neural activity
that is replayed in the brain during memory recall.
And if that were successful,
that would be the first example of reading a memory from a connectome.
have you ever tried to wire up a system
as complex as this?
I hope not.
But if you have, you know it's very easy to make a mistake.
Can anyone guess: what's the total length of wires in your brain?
I estimate, millions of miles,
all packed in your skull.
And if you appreciate that number,
you can easily see
there is huge potential for mis-wiring of the brain.
And indeed, the popular press loves headlines like,
"Anorexic brains are wired differently,"
but in truth,
we can't see the brain's wiring clearly enough
to tell if these are really true.
to see mental disorders in connectomes.
is to consider its most extreme implication.
Philosophers know this game very well.
If you believe that I am my connectome,
I think you must also accept the idea
that death is the destruction
of your connectome.
I mention this because there are prophets today
who claim that technology
will fundamentally alter the human condition
and perhaps even transform the human species.
One of their most cherished dreams
If you pay 100,000 dollars,
you can arrange to have your body frozen after death
and stored in liquid nitrogen
of a frozen brain.
We know that damage to the brain
occurs after death and during freezing.
The question is: has that damage erased the connectome?
If it has, there is no way that any future civilization
will be able to recover the memories of these frozen brains.
Resurrection might succeed for the body,
but not for the mind.
On the other hand, if the connectome is still intact,
that begins in the world of the very small,
and propels us to the world of the far future.
As we evolved from our ape-like ancestors
on the African savanna,
what distinguished us was our larger brains.
We have used our brains to fashion
ever more amazing technologies.
Eventually, these technologies will become so powerful
that we will use them to know ourselves
by deconstructing and reconstructing
our own brains.
I believe that this voyage of self-discovery
is not just for scientists,
but for all of us.
The Hindus say, "Nada brahma,"
one translation of which is, "The world is sound."
And in a way, that's true, because everything is vibrating.
In fact, all of you as you sit here right now are vibrating.
Every part of your body is vibrating at different frequencies.
So you are, in fact, a chord --
each of you an individual chord.
One definition of health may be
that that chord is in complete harmony.
Your ears can't hear that chord;
they can actually hear amazing things. Your ears can hear 10 octaves.
Incidentally, we see just one octave.
Your ears are always on -- you have no ear lids.
They work even when you sleep.
The smallest sound you can perceive
moves your eardrum just four atomic diameters.
The loudest sound you can hear
is a trillion times more powerful than that.
but for listening.
Listening is an active skill,
whereas hearing is passive, listening is something that we have to work at --
it's a relationship with sound.
And yet it's a skill that none of us are taught.
For example, have you ever considered that there are listening positions,
places you can listen from?
Here are two of them.
Reductive listening is listening "for."
It reduces everything down to what's relevant
and it discards everything that's not relevant.
Men typically listen reductively.
So he's saying, "I've got this problem."
He's saying, "Here's your solution. Thanks very much. Next."
That's the way we talk, right guys?
is listening "with," not listening "for."
It's got no destination in mind --
it's just enjoying the journey.
Women typically listen expansively.
If you look at these two, eye contact, facing each other,
possibly both talking at the same time.
(Laughter)
Men, if you get nothing else out of this talk,
practice expansive listening,
and you can transform your relationships.
is noise, surrounding us all the time.
Noise like this, according to the European Union,
is reducing the health and the quality of life
of 25 percent
of the population of Europe.
Two percent of the population of Europe --
that's 16 million people --
are having their sleep devastated
by noise like that.
Noise kills
200,000 people a year in Europe.
It's a really big problem.
you'd stick your fingers in your ears and hum.
These days, you can do a similar thing, it just looks a bit cooler.
It looks a bit like this.
The trouble with widespread headphone use
is it brings three really big health issues.
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined:
"schizophonia."
It's a dislocation
between what you see and what you hear.
So, we're inviting into our lives
the voices of people who are not present with us.
I think there's something deeply unhealthy
about living all the time in schizophonia.
is compression.
We squash music to fit it into our pocket
and there is a cost attached to this.
Listen to this -- this is an uncompressed piece of music.
(Music)
And now the same piece of music with 98 percent of the data removed.
(Music)
I do hope that some of you at least
can hear the difference between those two.
There is a cost of compression.
It makes you tired and irritable to have to make up all of that data.
You're having to imagine it.
It's not good for you in the long run.
noise-induced hearing disorder.
Ten million Americans already have this for one reason or another,
but really worryingly,
16 percent --
roughly one in six -- of American teenagers
suffer from noise-induced hearing disorder
as a result of headphone abuse.
One study at an American university
found that 61 percent of college freshmen
had damaged hearing
as a result of headphone abuse.
We may be raising an entire generation of deaf people.
Now that's a really serious problem.
and pass these on to your children, please.
Professional hearing protectors are great;
I use some all the time.
If you're going to use headphones, buy the best ones you can afford
because quality means you don't have to have it so loud.
If you can't hear somebody talking to you in a loud voice,
it's too loud.
And thirdly, if you're in bad sound,
it's fine to put your fingers in your ears or just move away from it.
Protect your ears in that way.
WWB:
Wind, water, birds --
stochastic natural sounds
composed of lots of individual random events,
all of it very healthy,
all of it sound that we evolved to over the years.
Seek those sounds out; they're good for you and so it this.
Silence is beautiful.
The Elizabethans described language
as decorated silence.
I urge you to move away from silence with intention
and to design soundscapes just like works of art.
Have a foreground, a background, all in beautiful proportion.
It's fun to get into designing with sound.
If you can't do it yourself, get a professional to do it for you.
Sound design is the future,
and I think it's the way we're going to change the way the world sounds.
eight ways sound can improve health.
First, ultrasound: we're very familiar with it from physical therapy;
it's also now being used to treat cancer.
Lithotripsy -- saving thousands of people a year from the scalpel
by pulverizing stones with high-intensity sound.
Sound healing is a wonderful modality.
It's been around for thousands of years.
I do urge you to explore this.
There are great things being done there, treating now autism,
dementia and other conditions.
And music, of course. Just listening to music is good for you,
if it's music that's made with good intention,
made with love, generally.
Devotional music, good -- Mozart, good.
There are all sorts of types of music
that are very healthy.
and get involved.
First of all, listen consciously.
I hope that that after this talk you'll be doing that.
It's a whole new dimension to your life and it's wonderful to have that dimension.
Secondly, get in touch with making some sound --
create sound.
The voice is the instrument we all play,
and yet how many of us are trained in using our voice? Get trained;
learn to sing, learn to play an instrument.
Musicians have bigger brains -- it's true.
You can do this in groups as well.
It's a fantastic antidote to schizophonia;
to make music and sound in a group of people,
whichever style you enjoy particularly.
And let's take a stewarding role for the sound around us.
Protect your ears? Yes, absolutely.
Design soundscapes to be beautiful around you
at home and at work.
And let's start to speak up
when people are assailing us
with the noise that I played you early on.
to improve your health with sound.
My vision is of a world that sounds beautiful
and if we all start doing these things,
we will take a very big step in that direction.
So I urge you to take that path.
I wish you sound health.
And that means I have a question:
and no question, many things are happening there right now.
we're humans, we live in a physical world.
It's rich, it tastes good, it feels good, it smells good.
So the question is:
and the Wii with its bodily activity,
you can see the tendency; it's getting physical.
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile.
that has an iron weight inside, which we can move around,
and you can feel where it's heavy.
We shift the gravitational center of it.
So you move around the content on the display,
but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device.
"OK, move right. Walk ahead. Make a left here."
the second thing, that's shape.
well, they could be thin, right?
But if it has 500 pages, I want to feel that "Harry Potter" --
Again, it's a mobile phone-shaped box,
and this one can change its shape.
For example, it can be thin in your pocket,
which we of course want it to be.
It's also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand
sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone
that are bigger than the phone itself.
The third thing operates on a different level.
As humans, we are social, we are empathic,
and that's great.
Wouldn't that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive?
Think of a hamster in the pocket.
Well, I can feel it, it's doing all right. I don't have to check it.
I want you to take a trip with me.
Picture yourself driving
down a small road in Africa,
and as you drive along, you look off to the side,
and this is what you see:
you see a field of graves.
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.
And you go into the town,
and you inquire, "What's going on here?"
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.
And then someone says,
"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."
HIV isn't like other medical conditions;
it's stigmatizing.
People are reluctant to talk about it --
there's a fear associated with it.
And I'm going to talk about HIV today,
about the deaths,
about the stigma.
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.
And as you can see,
Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.
There are 33 million people
living with HIV in the world today.
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million
are living in sub-Saharan Africa.
There are 1.4 million pregnant women
in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV
and of these, 90 percent
are in sub-Saharan Africa.
We talk about things in relative terms.
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies
and HIV-positive mothers.
The United States -- a large country --
each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV
who give birth to a child.
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country --
8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,
outside of Johannesburg in South Africa,
and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women
giving birth --
a hospital the same as a country.
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg
that when you compare
everything here to South Africa, it just pales,
because in South Africa,
each year 300,000 mothers with HIV
give birth to children.
and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public
that if a mother is HIV-positive,
she's going to infect her child.
The reality is really, very different.
In resource-rich countries,
with all the tests and treatment we currently have,
less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive --
98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,
in the absence of tests and treatment,
40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected --
40 percent versus two percent --
an enormous difference.
So these programs --
and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk --
these prevention programs,
simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers
to prevent them from infecting their babies,
and also the medicines we give to mothers
to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.
It's the drugs she receives
to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding
and safer sex.
It's an entire package of services,
and it works.
since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,
there's been an 80-percent decline
in the number of HIV-infected children.
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV
each year in the United States
and yet, still,
over 400,000 children
are born every year in the world today with HIV.
What does that mean?
It means 1,100 children infected each day --
1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.
And where do they come from?
Well, less than one comes from the United States.
One, on average, comes from Europe.
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.
And each day,
a thousand babies -- a thousand babies
are born each day with HIV in Africa.
and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.
And let's look at another map.
And here, again, we see
Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.
And it's the same with nurses.
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa
has 24 percent
of the global disease burden
and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.
That means doctors and nurses
simply don't have the time to take care of patients.
A nurse in a busy clinic
will see 50 to 100 patients in a day,
which leaves her just minutes per patient --
minutes per patient.
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?
when there was just a simple test
and a single dose of a drug,
a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,
would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,
explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,
explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,
and test the baby -- in minutes.
Well, fortunately since 2001,
we've got new treatments, new tests,
and we're far more successful,
but we don't have any more nurses.
And so these are the tests
a nurse now has to do
in those same few minutes.
It's not possible --
it doesn't work.
And so we need to find
better ways of providing care.
mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.
These women are here for care,
but we know that just doing a test,
just giving someone a drug,
it's not enough.
Meds don't equal medical care.
Doctors and nurses, frankly,
don't have the time or skills
to tell people what to do in ways they understand.
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do,
and I expect them to follow my guidance --
because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard --
but the reality is,
if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.
You should always use a condom,"
and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered --
what's going to happen?
If I tell her to take her medicines every day
and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so
it's just not going to work.
And so we need to do more,
we need to do it differently,
we need to do it in ways that are affordable
and accessible and can be taken to scale,
which means it can be done everywhere.
I want to take you on a little trip.
Imagine yourself, if you can,
you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.
You go in for a test
and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.
And then they give you another test
and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.
And the nurse takes you into a room,
and she tells you about the tests
and HIV and the medicines you can take
and how to take care of yourself and your baby,
and you hear none of it.
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,
and my baby is going to die."
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.
And you don't know who you can talk to,
because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing
that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,
you're likely to be thrown out
without any means of support.
And this -- this is the face and story
of HIV in Africa today.
and some good news.
And I want to change the story a little bit.
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,
takes her to a room.
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,
and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,
"Welcome to mothers2mothers.
Have a seat. You're safe here.
We're all HIV-positive.
You're going to be okay. You're going to live.
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative."
as a community's single greatest resource.
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.
So often the men are gone.
They're working, or they're not part of the household.
Our organization, mothers2mothers,
enlists women with HIV
as care providers.
We bring mothers who have HIV,
who've been through these PMTCT programs
in the very facilities,
to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses
as part of the health care team.
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers,
are able to engage women
who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,
have found out about being HIV-positive,
who need support and education.
And they support them around the diagnosis
and educate them about how to take their medicines,
how to take care of themselves,
how to take care of their babies.
Consider: if you needed surgery,
you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?
But if you wanted to understand
what that surgery would do to your life,
you'd like to engage someone,
someone who's had the procedure.
Patients are experts on their own experience,
and they can share that experience with others.
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.
they come from the communities in which they work.
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,
just like doctors and nurses.
And we open bank accounts for them
and they're paid directly into the accounts,
because their money's protected;
the men can't take it away from them.
They go through two to three weeks
of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.
But so often, they only get trained once,
so they're not aware of new medicines,
new guidelines as they come out.
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year
and retrained.
And so doctors and nurses --
they look up to them as experts.
Imagine that: a woman, a former patient,
being able to educate her doctor for the first time
and educate the other patients
that she's taking care of.
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,
keep the children alive --
no more orphans.
And the third, and maybe the most grand,
is to find ways to empower women,
enable them to fight the stigma
and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.
So how do we do it?
Well, maybe the most important engagement
is the one-to-one,
seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,
explaining how they can take care of themselves.
We go beyond that;
we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.
But in Rwanda, in one country,
they've got a policy
that a woman can't come for care
unless she brings the father of the baby with her --
that's the rule.
And so the father and the mother, together,
go through the counseling and the testing.
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly
if there hasn't been disclosure?
Disclosure is so important to treatment,
because again, people need the support of family members and friends
to take their medicines regularly.
We also work in groups.
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing,
but what happens is women, they come together --
under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers --
they come together, and they share their personal experiences.
And it's through the sharing
that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,
how to disclose how to take medicines.
And then there's the community outreach,
engaging women in their communities.
If we can change the way
households believe and think,
we can change the way communities believe and think.
And if we can change enough communities,
we can change national attitudes.
We can change national attitudes to women
and national attitudes to HIV.
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.
We have the medicines, we have the tests,
but how do you reduce the stigma?
And it's important about disclosure.
and she told me a story.
She had been asked by one of the clients
to go to the home of the client,
because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters
about her HIV status,
and she was afraid to go by herself.
And so the mentor mother went along with.
And the patient walked into the house
and said to her mother and siblings,
"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."
And everybody was quiet.
And then her oldest brother stood up and said,
"I too have something to tell you.
I'm HIV-positive.
I've been afraid to tell everybody."
And then this older sister stood up and said,
"I too am living with the virus,
and I've been ashamed."
And then her younger brother stood up and said,
"I'm also positive.
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."
And you see where this is going.
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.
I thought you were going to hate me."
And there they were, all of them together for the first time
being able to share this experience for the first time
and to support each other for the first time.
and they are crying and scared.
I tell them my story,
that I am HIV-positive,
but my child is HIV-negative.
I tell them, "You are going to make it,
and you will raise a healthy baby."
I am proof that there is hope.
of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.
And it is a crisis in health care systems.
Even as we have more tests and more drugs,
we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.
Task-shifting is traditionally
when you take health care services from one provider
and have another provider do it.
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.
And the issue in Africa
is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,
and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.
How do you build a better health care system?
We've chosen to redefine the health care system
as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.
And so what nurses do
is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain
how to take the drugs, the side effects.
They delegate education about infant feeding,
family planning, safer sex,
actions that nurses simple just don't have time for.
The world is increasingly seeing these programs
as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.
And our organization
helps women across that bridge.
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born --
we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,
ensuring that they live healthy,
successful lives.
The first, at the patient level --
mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,
keeping mothers healthy to raise them.
The second, communities --
empowering women.
They become leaders within their communities.
They change the way communities think --
we need to change attitudes to HIV.
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.
We have to do that.
And then rework the level of the health care systems,
building stronger health care systems.
Our health care systems are broken.
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.
And so doctors and nurses
who need to try to change people's behaviors
don't have the skills, don't have the time --
our mentor mothers do.
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,
we can do that.
back in 2001.
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday
on where ideas come from,
I was in the shower at the time --
I was alone.
(Laughter)
The program is now working in nine countries,
we have 670 program sites,
we're seeing about 230,000
women every month,
we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,
and last year, they enrolled
300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.
That is 20 percent
of the global HIV-positive pregnant women --
20 percent of the world.
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.
Past patients taking care of present patients.
And empowerment through employment --
reducing stigma.
hope that one day
we shall win this fight
against HIV and AIDS.
Each person must know
their HIV status.
Those who are HIV-negative
must know how to stay negative.
Those who are HIV-infected
must know how
to take care of themselves.
HIV-positive pregnant women
must get PMTCT services
in order to have
HIV-negative babies.
All of this is possible,
if we each contribute to this fight.
Mothers caring for mothers.
It's transformational.
I'm going to share with you the story
as to how I have become
an HIV/AIDS campaigner.
And this is the name of my campaign: SING Campaign.
In November of 2003,
I was invited to take part
in the launch of Nelson Mandela's
46664 Foundation --
that is his HIV/AIDS foundation.
And 46664 is the number
that Mandela had when he was imprisoned in Robben Island.
And that's me with Youssou N'Dour,
onstage, having the time of my life.
The next day, all the artists were invited
to join Mandela in Robben Island,
where he was going to give a conference
to the world's press,
standing in front of his former prison cell.
You can see the bars of the window there.
It was quite a momentous occasion for all of us.
In that moment in time,
Mandela told the world's press
that there was a virtual genocide
taking place in his country;
that post-apartheid
Rainbow Nation,
a thousand people were dying on a daily basis
and that the front line victims,
the most vulnerable of all,
were women and children.
because I am a woman and I am a mother,
and I hadn't realized
that the HIV/AIDS pandemic
was directly affecting women in such a way.
And so I committed -- when I left South Africa,
when I left Capetown,
I told myself, "This is going to be something
that I have to talk about.
I have to serve."
And so, subsequently
I participated in every single
46664 event
that I could take part in
and gave news conferences,
interviews,
talking and using my platform as a musician,
with my commitment to Mandela --
out of respect for the tremendous,
unbelievable work that he had done.
Everyone in the world respects Nelson Mandela,
everyone reveres Nelson Mandela.
But do they all know
about what has been taking place in South Africa,
his country,
the country that had one of the highest incidents
of transmission of the virus?
I think that if I went out into the street now
and I told people what was happening there,
they would be shocked.
to have met Zackie Achmat,
the founder of Treatment Action Campaign,
an incredible campaigner and activist.
I met him at a 46664 event.
He was wearing a t-shirt like the one I wear now.
This is a tool --
this tells you I am in solidarity
with people who have HIV,
people who are living with HIV.
And in a way because of the stigma, by wearing this t-shirt
I say, "Yes, we can talk about this issue.
It doesn't have to be in the closet."
I became a member of Treatment Action Campaign
and I'm very proud to be a member
of that incredible organization.
It's a grassroots campaign
with 80 percent membership being women,
most of whom are HIV-positive.
They work in the field.
They have tremendous outreach
to the people who are living directly
with the effects of the virus.
They have education programs.
They bring out the issues of stigma.
It's quite extraordinary what they do.
And yes, my SING Campaign
has supported Treatment Action Campaign
in the way that I have tried to raise awareness
and to try to also raise funds.
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise
has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign
and the incredible work that they do,
and are still continuing to do in South Africa.
SING Campaign is basically just me
and about three or four wonderful people
who help to support me.
I've traveled all over the world
in the last two and a half years --
I went to about 12 different countries.
Here I am in Oslo in Norway,
getting a nice, fat check;
singing in Hong Kong, trying to get people to raise money.
In Johannesburg, I had the opportunity to play
to a mainly white, middle-class South African audience
who ended up in tears
because I use film clips
that really touch the heart, the whole nature,
of this terrible tragedy that is taking place,
that people are tending to avoid,
because they are fatigued,
and they really don't quite know what the solutions are.
Aaron Motsoaledi, the current health minister,
attended that concert
and I had an opportunity to meet with him,
and he gave his absolute commitment
to try to making a change,
which is absolutely necessary.
This is in the Scottish Parliament.
I've subsequently become an envoy
for Scotland and HIV.
And I was showing them my experiences
and trying to, again, raise awareness.
And once again, in Edinburgh
with the wonderful African Children's Choir who I simply adore.
And it's children like this, many of whom have been orphaned
because of their family being affected
by the AIDS virus.
he's the director of UNAIDS.
And I'm very honored
by the fact that Michel invited me,
only a few months ago,
to become a UNAIDS ambassador.
And in this way, I've been strengthening my platform
and broadening my outreach.
The message that UNAIDS
are currently sending out to the world
is that we would like to see the virtual elimination
of the transmission of the virus
from mother to child by 2015.
It's a very ambitious goal
but we believe it can be achieved with political will.
This can happen.
who is HIV positive
and we're smiling, both of us are smiling, because we're very confident,
because we know that that young woman
is receiving treatment
so her life can be extended
to take care of the baby she's about to give birth to.
And her baby will receive PMTCT,
which will mean that that baby
can be born free of the virus.
Now that is prevention
at the very beginning of life.
It's one way to start looking at intervention
with the AIDS pandemic.
to tell you the little story
about Avelile.
This is Avelile --
she goes with me wherever I go.
I tell her story to everyone
because she represents
one of millions
of HIV/AIDS orphans.
Avelile's mother
had HIV virus --
she died
from AIDS-related illness.
Avelile had the virus,
she was born with the virus.
And here she is at seven years old,
weighing no more than a one year-old baby.
At this point in her life,
she's suffering with full-blown AIDS
and had pneumonia.
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape
and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child.
The doctors and nurses were phenomenal.
They put her on very special nutritious diet
and took great care of her.
And we didn't know when we left the hospital --
because we filmed her story -- we didn't know if she was going to survive.
So, it was obviously -- it was a very emotional encounter
and left us feeling very resonant
with this direct experience, this one child,
you know, that story.
Five months later,
we went back to South Africa
to meet Avelile again.
And I'm getting --
the hairs on my -- I don't know if you can see the hairs on my arms.
They're standing up because I know what I'm going to show you.
This is the transformation that took place.
Isn't it extraordinary?
for the doctors and nurses of the hospital who took care of Avelile.
And I take it that you appreciate that kind of transformation.
So, I would like to say to you,
each one in the audience,
if you feel that every mother
and every child in the world
has the right to have access
to good nutrition and good medical care,
and you believe that the Millennium Development Goals,
specifically five and six,
should be absolutely committed to
by all governments around the world --
especially in sub-Saharan Africa --
could you please stand up.
I think that's fair to say,
it's almost everyone in the hall.
This is the Grand Café here in Oxford.
That's its great claim to fame.
And I wanted to show it to you,
not because I want to give you the Starbucks tour
of historic England --
what people drank -- both elite and mass folks drank --
Alcohol was the daytime beverage of choice.
You would be sharper and more alert.
is the architecture of the space.
It was a space where people would get together,
And an astonishing number of innovations from this period
have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story.
And what I've been looking for is shared patterns,
Are there recurring patterns that we can learn from,
that we can take and apply to our own lives
and to really understand these principles is,
the "stroke" of insight,
we have the "light bulb" moments, right?
share this basic assumption,
firing in sync with each other inside your brain.
It's a new configuration that has never formed before.
And the question is: How do you get your brain into environments
where these new networks are going to be more likely to form?
a lot more recent than the 1650s.
A wonderful guy named Timothy Prestero
has an organization called Design That Matters.
One of the things that's very frustrating about this
So the technology is there.
These are standard in all the industrialized worlds.
The problem is, if you buy a $40,000 incubator,
it will work great for a year or two years,
and then something will go wrong and it will break,
and it will remain broken forever,
because you don't have a whole system of spare parts,
and you don't have the on-the-ground expertise
to fix this $40,000 piece of equipment.
They seem to have the expertise to keep cars working.
So they started to think,
It's called the NeoNurture device.
it runs off a car battery.
And that means we have to change some of our models
I mean, this is one vision of it.
people are notoriously unreliable
or their history of their best ideas.
when they were sitting in front of the microscope,
And when we think about the classic image of the scientist in the lab,
we have this image -- you know, they're poring over the microscope,
is that, in fact, almost all of the important breakthrough ideas
did not happen alone in the lab, in front of the microscope.
when everybody got together and shared their latest data and findings,
and I've started calling it the "liquid network,"
where you have lots of different ideas that are together,
different backgrounds, different interests,
So they want to tell the story of the eureka moment.
They want to say, "There I was, I was standing there,
I call this the "slow hunch."
Darwin himself, in his autobiography,
as a classic eureka moment.
the basic algorithm of natural selection kind of pops into his head,
and he says, "Ah, at last, I had a theory with which to work."
That's in his autobiography.
Darwin kept these copious notebooks,
where he wrote down every little idea he had, every little hunch.
for months and months and months
There are passages where you can read it,
and you think you're reading from a Darwin textbook,
from the period before he has his epiphany.
And so what you realize is that Darwin, in a sense,
had the idea, he had the concept,
but was unable to fully think it yet.
And that is, actually, how great ideas often happen --
How do you create environments
And the other thing is to allow those hunches
you know, building barricades,
But I think there's a case to be made
that we should spend at least as much time, if not more,
valuing the premise of connecting ideas
and not just protecting them.
which I think captures a lot of these values.
It's October of 1957,
and Sputnik has just launched.
And, of course, this is nerd heaven, right?
are there at the cafeteria table,
having an informal conversation with a bunch of their colleagues.
And these two guys are named Guier and Weiffenbach.
They start talking, and one of them says,
it was right at 20 MHz, so you could pick it up really easily,
And before long, they think, "Jeez, this is kind of historic.
And they start writing down the date stamp, time stamps
And then they start thinking,
"Well, gosh, we're noticing small little frequency variations here.
and the points at which it's furthest away.
That's pretty cool."
that takes up an entire room that they'd just gotten at the APL.
of this satellite around the Earth,
just from listening to this one little signal,
pulls them into the room and says,
"Hey, you guys, I have to ask you something
about that project you were working on.
because, see, I have these new nuclear submarines"
And it's really hard to figure out how to get your missile
so that it will land right on top of Moscow
and anybody could come along and build new technology
is a great case study, a great lesson
of open innovative systems.
Hello. I would like to start my talk
with actually two questions, and the first one is:
How many people here actually eat pig meat?
Please raise your hand --
oh, that's a lot.
And how many people have actually seen
a live pig producing this meat?
In the last year?
you actually never see a pig, which is really strange,
because, on a population of 16 million people,
we have 12 million pigs.
And well, of course, the Dutch can't eat all these pigs.
They eat about one-third, and the rest is exported
to all kinds of countries in Europe and the rest of the world.
A lot goes to the U.K., Germany.
because historically, the whole pig would be used up until the last bit
so nothing would be wasted --
and I was curious to find out
if this was actually still the case.
And I spent about three years researching.
And I followed this one pig
with number "05049,"
all the way up until the end
and to what products it's made of.
And in these years, I met all kinds people
like, for instance, farmers and butchers, which seems logical.
But I also met aluminum mold makers,
ammunition producers
and all kinds of people.
And what was striking to me
is that the farmers actually had no clue
what was made of their pigs,
but the consumers -- as in us --
had also no idea
of the pigs being in all these products.
I took all this research
and I made it into a -- well, basically it's a product catalog of this one pig,
and it carries a duplicate of his ear tag
on the back.
And it consists of seven chapters --
the chapters are skin, bones, meat, internal organs,
blood, fat and miscellaneous.
(Laughter)
In total,
they weigh 103.7 kilograms.
And to show you how often you actually
meet part of this pig in a regular day,
I want to show you some images of the book.
So, in soap, fatty acids
made from boiling pork bone fat
are used as a hardening agent,
but also for giving it a pearl-like effect.
Then if you look around you in the bathroom,
you see lots more products
like shampoo, conditioner,
anti-wrinkle cream, body lotion,
but also toothpaste.
Then, so, before breakfast,
you've already met the pig so many times.
Then, at breakfast, the pig that I followed,
the hairs off the pig or proteins from the hairs off the pig
were used as an improver of dough.
(Laughter)
Well, that's what the producer says: it's "improving the dough,
of course."
In low-fat butter, or actually in many low-fat products,
when you take the fat out, you actually take the taste and the texture out.
So what they do is they put gelatin back in,
in order to retain the texture.
there might very well be cellular concrete,
which is a very light kind of concrete
that's actually got proteins from bones inside
and it's also fully reusable.
In the train brakes -- at least in the German train brakes --
there's this part of the brake
that's made of bone ash.
And in cheesecake and all kinds of desserts,
like chocolate mousse, tiramisu, vanilla pudding,
everything that's cooled in the supermarket,
there's gelatin to make it look good.
Fine bone china -- this is a real classic.
Of course, the bone in fine-bone china
gives it its translucency
and also its strength,
in order to make these really fine shapes,
like this deer.
It's used in paint for the texture,
but also for the glossiness.
In sandpaper, bone glue
is actually the glue between the sand and the paper.
And then in paintbrushes,
hairs are used because, apparently, they're very suitable for making paintbrushes
because of their hard-wearing nature.
because, of course, half the book's meat
and you probably all know what meats they are.
But I didn't want you to miss out on this one,
because this, well, it's called "portion-controlled meat cuts."
And this is actually sold
in the frozen area of the supermarket.
And what it is -- it's actually steak.
So, this is sold as cow,
but what happens when you slaughter a cow --
at least in industrial factory farming --
they have all these little bits of steak left
that they can't actually sell as steak,
so what they do is they glue them all together
with fibrin from pig blood
into this really large sausage,
then freeze the sausage, cut it in little slices
and sell those as steak again.
And this also actually happens with tuna and scallops.
So, with the steak, you might drink a beer.
In the brewing process, there's lots of cloudy elements in the beer,
so to get rid of these cloudy elements,
what some companies do
is they pour the beer through a sort of gelatin sieve
in order to get rid of that cloudiness.
This actually also goes for wine as well as fruit juice.
that produces these cigarettes
that actually contain hemoglobin from pigs in the filter.
And according to them,
this creates an artificial lung in the filter.
(Laughter)
So, this is actually a healthier cigarette.
(Laughter)
Injectable collagen -- or, since the '70s, collagen from pigs --
has been used for injecting into wrinkles.
And the reason for this is that pigs are actually quite close to human beings,
so the collagen is as well.
Well, this must be the strangest thing I found.
This is a bullet coming from
a very large ammunition company in the United States.
I contacted all the producers of products
because I wanted them to send me the real samples
and the real specimens.
So I sent this company an email
saying, "Hello. I'm Christien. I'm doing this research.
And can you send me a bullet?"
(Laughter)
And well, I didn't expect them to even answer my email.
But they answered
and they said, "Why, thank you for your email. What an interesting story.
Are you in anyway related to the Dutch government?"
I thought that was really weird,
as if the Dutch government sends emails to anyone.
at least what I think is the most beautiful -- in the book, is this heart valve.
It's actually a very low-tech
and very high-tech product at the same time.
The low-tech bit is that it's literally a pig's heart valve
mounted in the high-tech bit,
which is a memory metal casing.
And what happens is this can be implanted into a human heart
without open heart surgery.
And once it's in the right spot,
they remove the outer shell,
and the heart valve, well, it gets this shape
and at that moment it starts beating, instantly.
It's really a sort of magical moment.
So this is actually a Dutch company,
so I called them up, and I asked,
"Can I borrow a heart valve from you?"
And the makers of this thing were really enthusiastic.
So they were like, "Okay, we'll put it in a jar for you with formalin,
and you can borrow it."
Great -- and then I didn't hear from them for weeks,
so I called,
and I asked, "What's going on with the heart valve?"
And they said, "Well the director of the company
decided not to let you borrow this heart valve,
because want his product
to be associated with pigs."
actually, to show that my first question,
if pigs are still used up until the last bit, was still true.
Well it is, because everything that can't be used for anything else
is made into a fuel
that can be used as renewable energy source.
And what they showed me
is that, well, firstly,
it's at least to say odd
that we don't treat these pigs
as absolute kings and queens.
And the second, is that we actually don't have a clue
of what all these products that surround us are made of.
but actually -- well, I am a little bit --
but I'm more fond
of raw materials in general.
And I think that, in order to take better care
of what's behind our products --
so, the livestock, the crops, the plants,
the non-renewable materials,
but also the people that produce these products --
the first step would actually be to know that they are there.
Now, since this is TEDGlobal,
who can tell me what this is called in French?
I see you're all up on the history of hurdy-gurdy --
"vielle à roue."
And in Spanish, "zanfona."
And in Italian, "ghironda," okay?
Hurdy-gurdy, or wheel fiddle.
The hurdy-gurdy is the only musical instrument
that uses a crank to turn a wheel
to rub strings, like the bow of a violin,
to produce music.
It has three different kinds of strings.
The first string is the drone string,
which plays a continuous sound like the bagpipe.
The second string is a melody string,
which is played with a wooden keyboard tuned like a piano.
And the third string is pretty innovative.
It's also the only instrument
that uses this kind of technique.
It activates what's called the buzzing bridge, or the dog.
When I turn the crank and I apply pressure,
it makes a sound like a barking dog.
So all of this is pretty innovative,
if you consider
that the hurdy-gurdy appeared about a thousand years ago
and it took two people to play it;
one to turn the crank,
and another person -- yes -- to play the melody
by physically pulling up large wooden pegs.
Luckily, all of this changed a couple of centuries later.
So, one person could actually play
and almost -- this is pretty heavy --
carry the hurdy-gurdy.
in mostly dance music
because of the uniqueness of the melody
combined with the acoustic boombox here.
And today, the hurdy-gurdy is used in all sorts of music --
traditional folk music,
dance, contemporary
and world music --
in the U.K., in France, in Spain
and in Italy.
And this kind of hurdy-gurdy takes anywhere from three to five years [to order and receive it].
It's made by specialized luthiers,
also in Europe.
And it's very difficult to tune.
There I go.
I'd like to sing in Basque,
which is the language spoken in the Basque Country where I live,
in the region in France and Spain.
based on traditional Basque rhythms.
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel.
For the last 10 years, I've been spending my time trying to figure out
how and why human beings
assemble themselves into social networks.
And the kind of social network I'm talking about
is not the recent online variety,
but rather, the kind of social networks
that human beings have been assembling for hundreds of thousands of years,
ever since we emerged from the African savannah.
So, I form friendships and co-worker
and sibling and relative relationships with other people
who in turn have similar relationships with other people.
And this spreads on out endlessly into a distance.
And you get a network that looks like this.
Every dot is a person.
Every line between them is a relationship between two people --
different kinds of relationships.
And you can get this kind of vast fabric of humanity,
in which we're all embedded.
what are the mathematical, social,
biological and psychological rules
that govern how these networks are assembled
and what are the similar rules
that govern how they operate, how they affect our lives.
But recently, we've been wondering
whether it might be possible to take advantage of this insight,
to actually find ways to improve the world,
to do something better,
to actually fix things, not just understand things.
So one of the first things we thought we would tackle
would be how we go about predicting epidemics.
if you're the CDC or some other national body --
is to sit in the middle where you are
and collect data
from physicians and laboratories in the field
that report the prevalence or the incidence of certain conditions.
So, so and so patients have been diagnosed with something,
or other patients have been diagnosed,
and all these data are fed into a central repository, with some delay.
And if everything goes smoothly,
one to two weeks from now
you'll know where the epidemic was today.
And actually, about a year or so ago,
there was this promulgation
of the idea of Google Flu Trends, with respect to the flu,
where by looking at people's searching behavior today,
we could know where the flu --
what the status of the epidemic was today,
what's the prevalence of the epidemic today.
is a means by which we might get
not just rapid warning about an epidemic,
but also actually
early detection of an epidemic.
And, in fact, this idea can be used
not just to predict epidemics of germs,
but also to predict epidemics of all sorts of kinds.
For example, anything that spreads by a form of social contagion
could be understood in this way,
from abstract ideas on the left
like patriotism, or altruism, or religion
to practices
like dieting behavior, or book purchasing,
or drinking, or bicycle-helmet [and] other safety practices,
or products that people might buy,
purchases of electronic goods,
anything in which there's kind of an interpersonal spread.
A kind of a diffusion of innovation
could be understood and predicted
by the mechanism I'm going to show you now.
the classic way of thinking about this
is the diffusion-of-innovation,
or the adoption curve.
So here on the Y-axis, we have the percent of the people affected,
and on the X-axis, we have time.
And at the very beginning, not too many people are affected,
and you get this classic sigmoidal,
or S-shaped, curve.
And the reason for this shape is that at the very beginning,
let's say one or two people
are infected, or affected by the thing
and then they affect, or infect, two people,
who in turn affect four, eight, 16 and so forth,
and you get the epidemic growth phase of the curve.
And eventually, you saturate the population.
There are fewer and fewer people
who are still available that you might infect,
and then you get the plateau of the curve,
and you get this classic sigmoidal curve.
And this holds for germs, ideas,
product adoption, behaviors,
and the like.
But things don't just diffuse in human populations at random.
They actually diffuse through networks.
Because, as I said, we live our lives in networks,
and these networks have a particular kind of a structure.
this is 105 people.
And the lines represent -- the dots are the people,
and the lines represent friendship relationships.
You might see that people occupy
different locations within the network.
And there are different kinds of relationships between the people.
You could have friendship relationships, sibling relationships,
spousal relationships, co-worker relationships,
neighbor relationships and the like.
And different sorts of things
spread across different sorts of ties.
For instance, sexually transmitted diseases
will spread across sexual ties.
Or, for instance, people's smoking behavior
might be influenced by their friends.
Or their altruistic or their charitable giving behavior
might be influenced by their coworkers,
or by their neighbors.
But not all positions in the network are the same.
that different people have different numbers of connections.
Some people have one connection, some have two,
some have six, some have 10 connections.
And this is called the "degree" of a node,
or the number of connections that a node has.
But in addition, there's something else.
So, if you look at nodes A and B,
they both have six connections.
But if you can see this image [of the network] from a bird's eye view,
you can appreciate that there's something very different
about nodes A and B.
So, let me ask you this -- I can cultivate this intuition by asking a question --
who would you rather be
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network, A or B?
(Audience: B.) Nicholas Christakis: B, it's obvious.
B is located on the edge of the network.
Now, who would you rather be
if a juicy piece of gossip were spreading through the network?
A. And you have an immediate appreciation
that A is going to be more likely
to get the thing that's spreading and to get it sooner
by virtue of their structural location within the network.
A, in fact, is more central,
and this can be formalized mathematically.
So, if we want to track something
that was spreading through a network,
what we ideally would like to do is to set up sensors
on the central individuals within the network,
including node A,
monitor those people that are right there in the middle of the network,
and somehow get an early detection
of whatever it is that is spreading through the network.
you would know that, soon enough,
everybody was about to contract this germ
or this piece of information.
And this would be much better
than monitoring six randomly chosen people,
without reference to the structure of the population.
And in fact, if you could do that,
what you would see is something like this.
On the left-hand panel, again, we have the S-shaped curve of adoption.
In the dotted red line, we show
what the adoption would be in the random people,
and in the left-hand line, shifted to the left,
we show what the adoption would be
in the central individuals within the network.
On the Y-axis is the cumulative instances of contagion,
and on the X-axis is the time.
And on the right-hand side, we show the same data,
but here with daily incidence.
And what we show here is -- like, here --
very few people are affected, more and more and more and up to here,
and here's the peak of the epidemic.
But shifted to the left is what's occurring in the central individuals.
And this difference in time between the two
is the early detection, the early warning we can get,
about an impending epidemic
in the human population.
is that mapping human social networks
is not always possible.
It can be expensive, not feasible,
unethical,
or, frankly, just not possible to do such a thing.
So, how can we figure out
who the central people are in a network
without actually mapping the network?
What we came up with
was an idea to exploit an old fact,
or a known fact, about social networks,
which goes like this:
Do you know that your friends
have more friends than you do?
Your friends have more friends than you do,
and this is known as the friendship paradox.
Imagine a very popular person in the social network --
like a party host who has hundreds of friends --
and a misanthrope who has just one friend,
and you pick someone at random from the population;
they were much more likely to know the party host.
And if they nominate the party host as their friend,
that party host has a hundred friends,
therefore, has more friends than they do.
And this, in essence, is what's known as the friendship paradox.
The friends of randomly chosen people
have higher degree, and are more central
than the random people themselves.
if you imagine just the people at the perimeter of the network.
If you pick this person,
the only friend they have to nominate is this person,
who, by construction, must have at least two
and typically more friends.
And that happens at every peripheral node.
And in fact, it happens throughout the network as you move in,
everyone you pick, when they nominate a random --
when a random person nominates a friend of theirs,
you move closer to the center of the network.
So, we thought we would exploit this idea
in order to study whether we could predict phenomena within networks.
Because now, with this idea
we can take a random sample of people,
have them nominate their friends,
those friends would be more central,
and we could do this without having to map the network.
at Harvard College
in the fall and winter of 2009, just a few months ago.
We took 1,300 randomly selected undergraduates,
we had them nominate their friends,
and we followed both the random students and their friends
daily in time
to see whether or not they had the flu epidemic.
And we did this passively by looking at whether or not they'd gone to university health services.
And also, we had them [actively] email us a couple of times a week.
Exactly what we predicted happened.
So the random group is in the red line.
The epidemic in the friends group has shifted to the left, over here.
And the difference in the two is 16 days.
By monitoring the friends group,
we could get 16 days advance warning
of an impending epidemic in this human population.
if you were an analyst who was trying to study an epidemic
or to predict the adoption of a product, for example,
what you could do is you could pick a random sample of the population,
also have them nominate their friends and follow the friends
and follow both the randoms and the friends.
Among the friends, the first evidence you saw of a blip above zero
in adoption of the innovation, for example,
would be evidence of an impending epidemic.
Or you could see the first time the two curves diverged,
as shown on the left.
When did the randoms -- when did the friends take off
and leave the randoms,
and [when did] their curve start shifting?
And that, as indicated by the white line,
occurred 46 days
before the peak of the epidemic.
So this would be a technique
whereby we could get more than a month-and-a-half warning
about a flu epidemic in a particular population.
how far advanced a notice one might get about something
depends on a host of factors.
It could depend on the nature of the pathogen --
different pathogens,
using this technique, you'd get different warning --
or other phenomena that are spreading,
or frankly, on the structure of the human network.
Now in our case, although it wasn't necessary,
we could also actually map the network of the students.
and their friendship ties.
And in a minute now, I'm going to put this map into motion.
We're going to take daily cuts through the network
for 120 days.
The red dots are going to be cases of the flu,
and the yellow dots are going to be friends of the people with the flu.
And the size of the dots is going to be proportional
to how many of their friends have the flu.
So bigger dots mean more of your friends have the flu.
And if you look at this image -- here we are now in September the 13th --
you're going to see a few cases light up.
You're going to see kind of blooming of the flu in the middle.
Here we are on October the 19th.
The slope of the epidemic curve is approaching now, in November.
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang -- you're going to see lots of blooming in the middle,
and then you're going to see a sort of leveling off,
fewer and fewer cases towards the end of December.
And this type of a visualization
can show that epidemics like this take root
and affect central individuals first,
before they affect others.
this method is not restricted to germs,
but actually to anything that spreads in populations.
Information spreads in populations,
norms can spread in populations,
behaviors can spread in populations.
And by behaviors, I can mean things like criminal behavior,
or voting behavior, or health care behavior,
like smoking, or vaccination,
or product adoption, or other kinds of behaviors
that relate to interpersonal influence.
If I'm likely to do something that affects others around me,
this technique can get early warning or early detection
about the adoption within the population.
The key thing is that for it to work,
there has to be interpersonal influence.
It cannot be because of some broadcast mechanism
affecting everyone uniformly.
can also be exploited -- with respect to networks --
can also be exploited in other ways,
for example, in the use of targeting
specific people for interventions.
So, for example, most of you are probably familiar
with the notion of herd immunity.
So, if we have a population of a thousand people,
and we want to make the population immune to a pathogen,
we don't have to immunize every single person.
If we immunize 960 of them,
it's as if we had immunized a hundred [percent] of them.
Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected,
there's no one for them to infect.
They are surrounded by immunized people.
So 96 percent is as good as 100 percent.
Well, some other scientists have estimated
what would happen if you took a 30 percent random sample
of these 1000 people, 300 people and immunized them.
Would you get any population-level immunity?
And the answer is no.
But if you took this 30 percent, these 300 people
and had them nominate their friends
and took the same number of vaccine doses
and vaccinated the friends of the 300 --
the 300 friends --
you can get the same level of herd immunity
as if you had vaccinated 96 percent of the population
at a much greater efficiency, with a strict budget constraint.
to target distribution of things like bed nets
in the developing world.
If we could understand the structure of networks in villages,
we could target to whom to give the interventions
to foster these kinds of spreads.
Or, frankly, for advertising with all kinds of products.
If we could understand how to target,
it could affect the efficiency
of what we're trying to achieve.
And in fact, we can use data
from all kinds of sources nowadays [to do this].
in a European country.
Every dot is a person, and every line represents
a volume of calls between the people.
And we can use such data, that's being passively obtained,
to map these whole countries
and understand who is located where within the network.
Without actually having to query them at all,
we can get this kind of a structural insight.
And other sources of information, as you're no doubt aware
are available about such features, from email interactions,
online interactions,
online social networks and so forth.
And in fact, we are in the era of what I would call
"massive-passive" data collection efforts.
They're all kinds of ways we can use massively collected data
to create sensor networks
to follow the population,
understand what's happening in the population,
and intervene in the population for the better.
Because these new technologies tell us
not just who is talking to whom,
but where everyone is,
and what they're thinking based on what they're uploading on the Internet,
and what they're buying based on their purchases.
And all this administrative data can be pulled together
and processed to understand human behavior
in a way we never could before.
So the truckers are just going about their business,
and they're buying fuel.
And we see a blip up in the truckers' purchases of fuel,
and we know that a recession is about to end.
Or we can monitor the velocity
with which people are moving with their phones on a highway,
and the phone company can see,
as the velocity is slowing down,
that there's a traffic jam.
And they can feed that information back to their subscribers,
but only to their subscribers on the same highway
located behind the traffic jam!
Or we can monitor doctors prescribing behaviors, passively,
and see how the diffusion of innovation with pharmaceuticals
occurs within [networks of] doctors.
Or again, we can monitor purchasing behavior in people
and watch how these types of phenomena
can diffuse within human populations.
that these massive-passive data can be used.
One is fully passive,
like I just described --
as in, for instance, the trucker example,
where we don't actually intervene in the population in any way.
One is quasi-active,
like the flu example I gave,
where we get some people to nominate their friends
and then passively monitor their friends --
do they have the flu, or not? -- and then get warning.
Or another example would be,
if you're a phone company, you figure out who's central in the network
and you ask those people, "Look, will you just text us your fever every day?
Just text us your temperature."
And collect vast amounts of information about people's temperature,
but from centrally located individuals.
And be able, on a large scale,
to monitor an impending epidemic
with very minimal input from people.
Or, finally, it can be more fully active --
as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today --
where people might globally participate in wikis,
or photographing, or monitoring elections,
and upload information in a way that allows us to pool
information in order to understand social processes
and social phenomena.
heralds a kind of new era
of what I and others would like to call
"computational social science."
It's sort of like when Galileo invented -- or, didn't invent --
came to use a telescope
and could see the heavens in a new way,
or Leeuwenhoek became aware of the microscope --
or actually invented --
and could see biology in a new way.
But now we have access to these kinds of data
that allow us to understand social processes
and social phenomena
in an entirely new way that was never before possible.
And with this science, we can
understand how exactly
the whole comes to be greater
than the sum of its parts.
And actually, we can use these insights
to improve society and improve human well-being.
Let's start with day and night.
Life evolved under conditions
of light and darkness,
light and then darkness.
And so plants and animals
developed their own internal clocks
so that they would be ready for these changes in light.
These are chemical clocks,
and they're found in every known being that has two or more cells
and in some that only have one cell.
if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach,
and you fly it all the way across the continent,
and you drop it into a sloped cage,
it will scramble up the floor of the cage
as the tide is rising
on its home shores,
and it'll skitter down again right as the water is receding
thousands of miles away.
It'll do this for weeks,
until it kind of gradually loses the plot.
And it's incredible to watch,
but there's nothing psychic or paranormal going on;
it's simply that these crabs have internal cycles
that correspond, usually, with what's going on around it.
And in humans, we call it the "body clock."
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone's watch
and you shut them into a bunker, deep underground,
for a couple of months. (Laughter)
People actually volunteer for this,
and they usually come out
kind of raving about their productive time in the hole.
So, no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be,
they all show the same thing.
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so --
and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this
over the course of the weeks.
And so, in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks,
rather than somehow sensing the day outside.
and it turns out that it's incredibly important in our lives.
It's a huge driver for culture
and I think that it's the most underrated force on our behavior.
We evolved as a species near the equator,
and so we're very well-equipped
to deal with 12 hours of daylight
and 12 hours of darkness.
But of course, we've spread to every corner of the globe
and in Arctic Canada, where I live,
we have perpetual daylight in summer
and 24 hours of darkness in winter.
So the culture, the northern aboriginal culture,
traditionally has been highly seasonal.
In winter, there's a lot of sleeping going on;
you enjoy your family life inside.
And in summer, it's almost manic hunting
and working activity very long hours,
very active.
What would our sleeping patterns be
in the sort of ideal sense?
Well, it turns out
that when people are living
without any sort of artificial light at all,
they sleep twice every night.
They go to bed around 8:00 p.m.
until midnight
and then again, they sleep
from about 2:00 a.m. until sunrise.
And in-between, they have a couple of hours
of sort of meditative quiet in bed.
And during this time,
there's a surge of prolactin,
the likes of which a modern day never sees.
The people in these studies
report feeling so awake during the daytime,
that they realize
they're experiencing true wakefulness
for the first time in their lives.
We're living in a culture of jet lag,
global travel,
24-hour business,
shift work.
And you know, our modern ways
of doing things
have their advantages,
but I believe we should understand the costs.
If nothing else, at least I've discovered
what it is we put our speakers through:
sweaty palms, sleepless nights,
a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.
I mean, it's quite brutal.
There are nine billion humans coming our way.
Now, the most optimistic dreams
can get dented by the prospect
of people plundering the planet.
But recently, I've become intrigued
by a different way of thinking of large human crowds,
because there are circumstances
where they can do something really cool.
It's a phenomenon that I think
any organization or individual can tap into.
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,
and perhaps the world's future overall.
The story starts with just a single person,
a child, behaving a little strangely.
This kid is known online as Lil Demon.
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,
that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.
How did he learn them?
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice
this must have taken?
Here's a clue.
♫ Step your game up. Oh. Oh. ♫
a filmmaker, Jonathan Chu,
who told me that was the moment he realized
the Internet was causing dance to evolve.
This is what he said at TED in February.
In essence,
dancers were challenging each other online to get better;
incredible new dance skills were being invented;
even the six-year-olds were joining in.
It felt like a revolution.
And so Jon had a brilliant idea:
He went out to recruit the best of the best dancers
off of YouTube
to create this dance troupe --
The League of Extraordinary Dancers, the LXD.
I mean, these kids were web-taught,
but they were so good that they got to play at the Oscars this year.
And at TED here in February,
their passion and brilliance just took our breath away.
of the evolution of dance
seems strangely familiar.
You know, a while after TEDTalks started taking off,
we noticed that speakers
were starting to spend a lot more time in preparation.
It was resulting in incredible new talks like these two.
... Months of preparation
crammed into 18 minutes,
raising the bar cruelly for the next generation of speakers,
with the effects that we've seen this week.
It's not as if J.J. and Jill
actually ended their talks saying, "Step your game up,"
but they might as well have.
So, in both of these cases,
you've got these cycles of improvement,
apparently driven
by people watching web video.
Well, I think it's the latest iteration of a phenomenon we can call
"crowd-accelerated innovation."
And there are just three things you need for this thing to kick into gear.
You can think of them
as three dials on a giant wheel.
You turn up the dials, the wheel starts to turn.
And the first thing you need is ... a crowd,
a group of people who share a common interest.
The bigger the crowd,
the more potential innovators there are.
That's important, but actually most people in the crowd
occupy these other roles.
They're creating the ecosystem
from which innovation emerges.
The second thing you need is light.
You need clear, open visibility
of what the best people in that crowd are capable of,
because that is how you will learn
how you will be empowered to participate.
And third, you need desire.
You know, innovation's hard work.
It's based on hundreds of hours of research, of practice.
Absent desire, not going to happen.
of this machine in action.
Dancers at a street corner --
it's a crowd, a small one,
but they can all obviously see what each other can do.
And the desire part comes, I guess,
from social status, right?
Best dancer walks tall, gets the best date.
There's probably going to be some innovation happening here.
But on the web,
all three dials are ratcheted right up.
The dance community is now global.
There's millions connected.
And amazingly,
you can still see what the best can do,
because the crowd itself shines a light on them,
either directly, through comments, ratings,
email, Facebook, Twitter,
or indirectly,
through numbers of views,
through links that point Google there.
So, it's easy to find the good stuff,
and when you've found it, you can watch it in close-up repeatedly
and read what hundreds of people have written about it.
That's a lot of light.
is really dialed way up.
I mean, you might just be a kid with a webcam,
but if you can do something that goes viral,
you get to be seen by the equivalent
of sports stadiums crammed with people.
You get hundreds of strangers writing excitedly about you.
And even if it's not that eloquent -- and it's not --
it can still really make your day.
So, this possibility
of a new type of global recognition,
I think, is driving huge amounts of effort.
And it's important to note that it's not just the stars who are benefiting:
because you can see the best, everyone can learn.
It's the crowd that shines the light and fuels the desire,
but the light and desire are a lethal one-two combination
that attract new people to the crowd.
So, this is a model
that pretty much any organization could use
to try and nurture its own cycle
of crowd-accelerated innovation.
Invite the crowd, let in the light,
dial up the desire.
And the hardest part about that is probably the light,
because it means you have to open up,
you have to show your stuff to the world.
It's by giving away what you think is your deepest secret
that maybe millions of people
are empowered to help improve it.
who really can't make use of this tool.
The dark side of the web
is allergic to the light.
I don't think we're going to see terrorists, for example,
publishing their plans online and saying to the world,
"Please, could you help us to actually
make them work this time?"
And if you can get that wheel to turn,
look out.
we've become a little obsessed with this idea of openness.
In fact, my colleague, June Cohen, has taken to calling it "radical openness,"
because it works for us each time.
We opened up our talks to the world,
and suddenly there are millions of people out there
helping spread our speakers' ideas,
and thereby making it easier for us
to recruit and motivate the next generation of speakers.
By opening up our translation program,
thousands of heroic volunteers --
some of them watching online right now, and thank you! --
have translated our talks
into more than 70 languages,
thereby tripling our viewership in non-English-speaking countries.
By giving away our TEDx brand,
we suddenly have a thousand-plus
live experiments in the art of spreading ideas.
And these organizers,
they're seeing each other, they're learning from each other.
We are learning from them.
We're getting great talks back from them.
The wheel is turning.
I mean, it's really not news for me to tell you
that innovation emerges out of groups.
You know, we've heard that this week --
this romantic notion of the lone genius
with the "eureka!" moment that changes the world
is misleading.
Even he said that, and he would know.
We're a social species.
We spark off each other.
It's also not news
to say that the Internet has accelerated innovation.
For the past 15 years,
powerful communities have been connecting online,
sparking off each other.
If you take programmers,
you know, the whole open-source movement
is a fantastic instance of crowd-accelerated innovation.
But what's key here is,
the reason these groups have been able to connect
is because their work output is of the type
that can be easily shared digitally --
a picture, a music file,
software.
And that's why what I'm excited about,
and what I think is under-reported,
is the significance of the rise
of online video.
that's going to allow the rest of the world's talents to be shared digitally,
thereby launching a whole new cycle
of crowd-accelerated innovation.
The first few years of the web
were pretty much video-free,
for this reason: video files are huge; the web couldn't handle them.
But in the last 10 years,
bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold.
Suddenly, here we are.
Humanity watches 80 million hours of YouTube every day.
Cisco actually estimates that, within four years,
more than 90 percent of the web's data will be video.
If it's all puppies, porn and piracy,
we're doomed.
I don't think it will be.
Video is high-bandwidth for a reason.
It packs a huge amount of data,
and our brains are uniquely wired to decode it.
He's a unicyclist.
Before YouTube,
there was no way for him to discover
his sport's true potential,
because you can't communicate this stuff in words, right?
But looking at video clips posted by strangers,
a world of possibility opens up for him.
Suddenly, he starts to emulate and then to innovate.
And a global community of unicyclists discover each other online,
inspire each other to greatness.
And there are thousands of other examples of this happening --
of video-driven evolution of skills,
ranging from the physical to the artful.
And I have to tell you,
as a former publisher of hobbyist magazines,
I find this strangely beautiful.
I mean, there's a lot of passion right here on this screen.
and video poetry aren't quite your cup of tea,
how about this.
Jove is a website
that was founded to encourage scientists
to publish their peer-reviewed research
on video.
There's a problem with a traditional scientific paper.
It can take months for a scientist in another lab
to figure out how to replicate the experiments
that are described in print.
Here's one such frustrated scientist,
Moshe Pritsker, the founder of Jove.
He told me that the world is wasting
billions of dollars on this.
But look at this video.
I mean, look: if you can show
instead of just describing,
that problem goes away.
So it's not far-fetched to say
that, at some point,
online video is going to dramatically accelerate scientific advance.
that's close to our hearts at TED,
where video is sometimes more powerful than print --
the sharing of an idea.
Why do people like watching TEDTalks?
All those ideas are already out there in print.
It's actually faster to read than to view.
Why would someone bother?
Well, so, there's some showing as well as telling.
But even leaving the screen out of it,
there's still a lot more being transferred than just words.
And in that non-verbal portion, there's some serious magic.
Somewhere hidden in the physical gestures,
the vocal cadence, the facial expressions,
the eye contact,
the passion,
the kind of awkward, British body language,
the sense of how the audience are reacting,
there are hundreds of subconscious clues
that go to how well you will understand,
and whether you're inspired --
light, if you like,
and desire.
Incredibly, all of this can be communicated
on just a few square inches of a screen.
relatively recent inventions.
Face-to-face communication has been fine-tuned
by millions of years of evolution.
That's what's made it into this mysterious, powerful thing it is.
Someone speaks,
there's resonance in all these receiving brains,
the whole group acts together.
I mean, this is the connective tissue
of the human superorganism in action.
It's probably driven our culture for millennia.
500 years ago, it ran into
a competitor with a lethal advantage.
It's right here.
Print scaled.
The world's ambitious innovators and influencers
now could get their ideas to spread far and wide,
and so the art of the spoken word
pretty much withered on the vine.
But now, in the blink of an eye,
the game has changed again.
It's not too much to say
that what Gutenberg did for writing,
online video can now do for face-to-face communication.
So, that primal medium,
which your brain is exquisitely wired for ...
that just went global.
We may have to reinvent an ancient art form.
I mean, today, one person speaking
can be seen by millions,
shedding bright light on potent ideas,
creating intense desire
for learning and to respond --
and in his case, intense desire to laugh.
For the first time in human history,
talented students
don't have to have their potential and their dreams
written out of history by lousy teachers.
They can sit two feet in front of the world's finest.
I mean, the world's universities are opening up their curricula.
Thousands of individuals and organizations
are sharing their knowledge and data online.
Thousands of people are figuring out new ways
to learn and, crucially,
to respond, completing the cycle.
And so, as we've thought about this,
you know, it's become clear to us
what the next stage of TED's evolution has to be.
TEDTalks can't be a one-way process, one-to-many.
Our future is many-to-many.
So, we're dreaming of ways
to make it easier for you, the global TED community,
to respond to speakers,
to contribute your own ideas,
maybe even your own TEDTalks,
and to help shine a light on the very best of what's out there.
Because, if we can bubble up the very best
from a vastly larger pool,
this wheel turns.
a similar process to this,
happening to global education overall?
I mean, does it have to be this painful,
top-down process?
Why not a self-fueling cycle
in which we all can participate?
It's the participation age, right?
Schools can't be silos.
We can't stop learning at age 21.
What if, in the coming crowd of nine billion ...
what if that crowd could learn enough
to be net contributors,
instead of net plunderers?
That changes everything, right?
I mean, that would take more teachers than we've ever had.
But the good news is they are out there.
They're in the crowd,
and the crowd is switching on lights,
and we can see them for the first time,
not as an undifferentiated mass of strangers,
but as individuals we can learn from.
Who's the teacher?
You're the teacher.
You're part of the crowd
that may be about to launch
the biggest learning cycle in human history,
a cycle capable of carrying all of us
to a smarter, wiser, more beautiful place.
near where I grew up.
Within five years, each of these kids is going to have access
to a cellphone capable of full-on web video
and capable of uploading video to the web.
I mean, is it crazy to think that this girl,
in the back, at the right, in 15 years,
might be sharing the idea that keeps the world beautiful
for your grandchildren?
It's not crazy; it's actually happening right now.
who just happens to live in Africa's biggest shantytown.
I'm one of the organizers of TEDxKibera.
There are so many good things which are happening right here in Kibera.
There's a self-help group.
They turned a trash place into a garden.
The same spot, it was a crime spot
where people were being robbed.
They used the same trash
to form green manure.
The same trash site
is feeding more than 30 families.
We have our own film school.
They are using Flip cameras
to record, edit,
and reporting to their own channel,
Kibera TV.
Because of a scarcity of land,
we are using the sacks to grow vegetables,
and also [we're] able to save on the cost of living.
Change happens when we see things in a different way.
Today, I see Kibera in a different way.
My message to TEDGlobal
and the entire world is:
Kibera is a hotbed
of innovation and ideas.
I bet Chris has always been an inspiring guy.
What's new -- and it's huge --
is that, for the first time, we get to see him,
and he can see us.
Right now, Chris and Kevin
and Dennis and Dickson and their friends
are watching us, in Nairobi, right now.
Guys,
we've learned from you today.
Thank you.
If you really want to understand
the problem that we're facing with the oceans,
you have to think about the biology
at the same time you think about the physics.
We can't solve the problems
unless we start studying the ocean
in a very much more interdisciplinary way.
So I'm going to demonstrate that through
discussion of some of the climate change things that are going on in the ocean.
We'll look at sea level rise.
We'll look at ocean warming.
And then the last thing on the list there, ocean acidification --
if you were to ask me, you know, "What do you worry about the most?
What frightens you?"
for me, it's ocean acidification.
And this has come onto the stage pretty recently.
So I will spend a little time at the end.
like a number of you in this room.
And I think we all found it, simultaneously,
an eye-opening
and a very frustrating experience.
I sat in this large negotiation hall,
at one point, for three or four hours,
without hearing the word "oceans" one time.
It really wasn't on the radar screen.
The nations that brought it up
when we had the speeches of the national leaders --
it tended to be the leaders of the small island states,
the low-lying island states.
And by this weird quirk
of alphabetical order of the nations,
a lot of the low-lying states,
like Kiribati and Nauru,
they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows.
You know, they were marginalized
in the negotiation room.
is coming up with the right target.
It's not clear what the target should be.
And how can you figure out how to fix something
if you don't have a clear target?
Now, you've heard about "two degrees":
that we should limit temperature rise to no more than two degrees.
But there's not a lot of science behind that number.
We've also talked about
concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
Should it be 450? Should it be 400?
There's not a lot of science behind that one either.
Most of the science that is behind these numbers,
these potential targets,
is based on studies on land.
And I would say, for the people that work in the ocean
and think about what the targets should be,
we would argue that they must be much lower.
You know, from an oceanic perspective,
450 is way too high.
Now there's compelling evidence
that it really needs to be 350.
We are, right now, at 390 parts per million
of CO2 in the atmosphere.
We're not going to put the brakes on in time to stop at 450,
so we've got to accept we're going to do an overshoot,
and the discussion as we go forward
has to focus on how far the overshoot goes
and what's the pathway back to 350.
Why don't we know some of these things a little bit better?
Well, the problem is that
we've got very complicated forces in the climate system.
There's all kinds of natural causes of climate change.
There's air-sea interactions.
Here in Galapagos,
we're affected by El Ninos and La Nina.
But the entire planet warms up when there's a big El Nino.
Volcanoes eject aerosols into the atmosphere.
That changes our climate.
The ocean contains most of the exchangeable heat on the planet.
So anything that influences
how ocean surface waters mix with the deep water
changes the ocean of the planet.
And we know the solar output's not constant through time.
So those are all natural causes of climate change.
And then we have the human-induced causes
of climate change as well.
We're changing the characteristics of the surface of the land,
the reflectivity.
We inject our own aerosols into the atmosphere,
and we have trace gases, and not just carbon dioxide --
it's methane, ozone,
oxides of sulfur and nitrogen.
Is CO2 produced by man's activities
causing the planet to warm up?
But to answer that question,
to make a clear attribution to carbon dioxide,
you have to know something about
all of these other agents of change.
But the fact is we do know a lot about all of those things.
You know, thousands of scientists
have been working on understanding
all of these man-made causes
and the natural causes.
And we've got it worked out, and we can say,
"Yes, CO2 is causing the planet to warm up now."
Now, we have many ways to study natural variability.
I'll show you a few examples of this now.
It's a scientific drilling vessel.
We go out for months at a time and drill into the sea bed
to recover sediments
that tell us stories of climate change, right.
Like one of the ways to understand our greenhouse future
is to drill down in time
to the last period
where we had CO2 double what it is today.
And so that's what we've done with this ship.
This was -- this is south of the Antarctic Circle.
It looks downright tropical there.
One day where we had calm seas and sun,
which was the reason I could get off the ship.
Most of the time it looked like this.
We had a waves up to 50 ft.
and winds averaging
about 40 knots for most of the voyage
and up to 70 or 80 knots.
and I can't show you too many results from that right now,
but we'll go back one more year,
to another drilling expedition I've been involved in.
This was led by Ross Powell and Tim Naish.
It's the ANDRILL project.
And we made the very first bore hole
through the largest floating ice shelf on the planet.
This is a crazy thing, this big drill rig wrapped in a blanket
to keep everybody warm,
drilling at temperatures of minus 40.
And we drilled in the Ross Sea.
That's the Ross Sea Ice Shelf on the right there.
So, this huge floating ice shelf
the size of Alaska
comes from West Antarctica.
Now, West Antarctica is the part of the continent
where the ice is grounded on sea floor
as much as 2,000 meters deep.
So that ice sheet is partly floating,
and it's exposed to the ocean, to the ocean heat.
Because it's partly floating, you can imagine,
is sea level rises a little bit,
the ice lifts off the bed, and then it can break off and float north.
When that ice melts, sea level rises by six meters.
So we drill back in time to see how often that's happened,
and exactly how fast that ice can melt.
Here's the cartoon on the left there.
We drilled through a hundred meters of floating ice shelf
then through 900 meters of water
and then 1,300 meters into the sea floor.
So it's the deepest geological bore hole ever drilled.
And here's what we found.
Now, there's 40 scientists working on this project,
and people are doing all kinds of really complicated
and expensive analyses.
But it turns out, you know, the thing that told the best story
was this simple visual description.
You know, we saw this in the core samples as they came up.
We saw these alternations
between sediments that look like this --
there's gravel and cobbles in there
and a bunch of sand.
That's the kind of material in the deep sea.
It can only get there if it's carried out by ice.
So we know there's an ice shelf overhead.
And that alternates with a sediment that looks like this.
This is absolutely beautiful stuff.
This sediment is 100 percent made up
of the shells of microscopic plants.
And these plants need sunlight,
so we know when we find that sediment
there's no ice overhead.
And we saw about 35 alternations
between open water and ice-covered water,
between gravels and these plant sediments.
is that the Ross Sea region, this ice shelf,
melted back and formed anew
about 35 times.
And this is in the past four million years.
This was completely unexpected.
Nobody imagined that the West Antarctic Ice Sheet
was this dynamic.
In fact, the lore for many years has been,
"The ice formed many tens of millions of years ago,
and it's been there ever since."
And now we know that in our recent past
it melted back and formed again,
and sea level went up and down, six meters at a time.
Well, we're pretty sure that it's very small changes
in the amount of sunlight reaching Antarctica,
just caused by natural changes in the orbit of the Earth.
But here's the key thing:
you know, the other thing we found out
is that the ice sheet passed a threshold,
that the planet warmed up enough --
and the number's about one degree to one and a half degrees Centigrade --
the planet warmed up enough that it became ...
that ice sheet became very dynamic
and was very easily melted.
And you know what?
We've actually changed the temperature in the last century
just the right amount.
So many of us are convinced now
that West Antarctica, the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, is starting to melt.
We do expect to see a sea-level rise
on the order of one to two meters by the end of this century.
And it could be larger than that.
This is a serious consequence
for nations like Kiribati,
you know, where the average elevation
is about a little over a meter above sea level.
This is a bleached coral,
coral that died during the 1982-'83 El Nino.
This is from Champion Island.
It's about a meter tall Pavona clavus colony.
And it's covered with algae. That's what happens.
When these things die,
immediately, organisms come in
and encrust and live on that dead surface.
And so, when a coral colony is killed
by an El Nino event,
it leaves this indelible record.
You can go then and study corals
and figure out how often do you see this.
So one of the things thought of in the '80s
was to go back and take cores
of coral heads throughout the Galapagos
and find out how often was there a devastating event.
And just so you know, 1982-'83,
that El Nino killed 95 percent
of all the corals here in Galapagos.
Then there was similar mortality in '97-'98.
And what we found
after drilling back in time two to 400 years
was that these were unique events.
We saw no other mass mortality events.
So these events in our recent past really are unique.
So they're either just truly monster El Ninos,
or they're just very strong El Ninos
that occurred against a backdrop of global warming.
Either case, it's bad news
for the corals of the Galapagos Islands.
This is actually Easter Island. Look at this monster.
This coral is eight meters tall, right.
And it been growing for about 600 years.
Now, Sylvia Earle turned me on to this exact same coral.
And she was diving here with John Lauret -- I think it was 1994 --
and collected a little nugget and sent it to me.
And we started working on it,
and we figured out we could tell the temperature of the ancient ocean
from analyzing a coral like this.
So we have a diamond drill.
We're not killing the colony; we're taking a small core sample out of the top.
The core comes up as these cylindrical tubes of limestone.
And that material then we take back to the lab and analyze it.
You can see some of the coral cores there on the right.
We're starting to do it in the Western Pacific as well.
I'll take you back here to the Galapagos Islands.
And we've been working at this fascinating uplift here in Urbina Bay.
That the place where,
during an earthquake in 1954,
this marine terrace was lifted up
out of the ocean very quickly,
and it was lifted up about six to seven meters.
And so now you can walk through a coral reef without getting wet.
If you go on the ground there, it looks like this,
and this is the grandaddy coral.
It's 11 meters in diameter,
and we know that it started growing
in the year 1584.
Imagine that.
And that coral was growing happily in those shallow waters,
until 1954, when the earthquake happened.
is that these corals have growth bands.
When you cut them, slice those cores in half and x-ray them,
you see these light and dark bands.
Each one of those is a year.
We know these corals grow about a centimeter and a half a year.
And we just count on down to the bottom.
Then their other attribute is
that they have this great chemistry.
We can analyze the carbonate
that makes up the coral,
and there's a whole bunch of things we can do.
But in this case, we measured the different isotopes of oxygen.
Their ratio tells us the water temperature.
In this example here,
we had monitored this reef in Galapagos
with temperature recorders,
so we know the temperature of the water the coral's growing in.
Then after we harvest a coral, we measure this ratio,
and now you can see, those curves match perfectly.
you know, corals
are instrumental-quality recorders of change in the water.
And of course, our thermometers
only take us back 50 years or so here.
The coral can take us back
hundreds and thousands of years.
So, what we do:
we've merged a lot of different data sets.
It's not just my group; there's maybe 30 groups worldwide doing this.
But we get these instrumental- and near-instrumental-quality records
of temperature change that go back hundreds of years,
and we put them together.
Here's a synthetic diagram.
There's a whole family of curves here.
of temperature on the planet.
And there's five or six different compilations there,
But each one of those compilations reflects input
from hundreds of these kinds of records from corals.
We do similar things with ice cores.
We work with tree rings.
And that's how we discover
what is truly natural
and how different is the last century, right?
And I chose this one
because it's complicated and messy looking, right.
This is as messy as it gets.
You can see there's some signals there.
Some of the records
show lower temperatures than others.
Some of them show greater variability.
But they all tell us
what the natural variability is.
Some of them are from the northern hemisphere;
some are from the entire globe.
what's natural in the last thousand years is that the planet was cooling down.
It was cooling down
until about 1900 or so.
And there is natural variability
caused by the Sun, caused by El Ninos.
A century-scale, decadal-scale variability,
and we know the magnitude;
it's about two-tenths to four-tenths of a degree Centigrade.
But then at the very end is where
we have the instrumental record in black.
And there's the temperature up there in 2009.
You know, we've warmed the globe
about a degree Centigrade in the last century,
and there's nothing
in the natural part of that record
that resembles what we've seen in the last century.
You know, that's the strength of our argument,
that we are doing something that's truly different.
of ocean acidification.
I like it as a component of global change to talk about,
because, even if you are a hard-bitten global warming skeptic,
and I talk to that community fairly often,
you cannot deny
the simple physics
of CO2 dissolving in the ocean.
You know, we're pumping out lots of CO2 into the atmosphere,
from fossil fuels, from cement production.
Right now, about a third of that carbon dioxide
is dissolving straight into the sea, right?
And as it does so,
it makes the ocean more acidic.
So, you cannot argue with that.
That is what's happening right now,
and it's a very different issue
than the global warming issue.
It has many consequences.
There are many organisms
that build their shells out of calcium carbonate --
plants and animals both.
The main framework material of coral reefs
is calcium carbonate.
That material is more soluble
in acidic fluid.
So one of the things we're seeing
is organisms are having
to spend more metabolic energy
to build and maintain their shells.
At some point, as this transience,
as this CO2 uptake in the ocean continues,
that material's actually going to start to dissolve.
And on coral reefs,
where some of the main framework organisms disappear,
we will see a major loss
of marine biodiversity.
But it's not just the carbonate producers that are affected.
There's many physiological processes
that are influenced by the acidity of the ocean.
So many reactions involving enzymes and proteins
are sensitive to the acid content of the ocean.
So, all of these things --
greater metabolic demands,
reduced reproductive success,
changes in respiration and metabolism.
You know, these are things that we have good physiological reasons
to expect to see stressed
caused by this transience.
to track CO2 levels in the atmosphere,
going back millions of years.
We used to do it just with ice cores,
but in this case, we're going back 20 million years.
And we take samples of the sediment,
and it tells us the CO2 level of the ocean,
and therefore the CO2 level of the atmosphere.
And here's the thing:
you have to go back about 15 million years
to find a time when CO2 levels
were about what they are today.
You have to go back about 30 million years
to find a time when CO2 levels
were double what they are today.
Now, what that means is
that all of the organisms that live in the sea
have evolved in this chemostatted ocean,
with CO2 levels lower than they are today.
That's the reason that they're not able to respond or adapt
to this rapid acidification
that's going on right now.
came up with this statement last year:
"The prospect of ocean acidification
may well be the most serious
of all of the predicted outcomes
of anthropogenic CO2 release."
And I think that may very well be true,
so I'll close with this.
You know, we do need the protected areas, absolutely,
but for the sake of the oceans,
we have to cap or limit CO2 emissions
as soon as possible.

to the authorities nearest to you,"
when all of these ways we are encouraged
You know, we're bound together,
not, I think by technology, entertainment and design,
but by common cause.
I promise you the hand of the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation
is stretched out in friendship for now and years to come.
And I thank you for your kindness and your patience
My story is a little bit about war.
It's about disillusionment.
It's about death.
And it's about rediscovering
idealism
in all of that wreckage.
And perhaps also, there's a lesson
about how to deal with
our screwed-up, fragmenting
and dangerous world of the 21st century.
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.
I don't believe in a life or history
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"
led to consequence "C" --
these neat narratives that we're presented with,
and that perhaps we encourage in each other.
I believe in randomness,
and one of the reasons I believe that
is because me becoming a diplomat was random.
I'm colorblind.
I was born unable to see most colors.
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,
and I have to take my wife with me
to chose clothes.
I loved watching planes barrel over
our holiday home in the countryside.
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights,
and I can't distinguish color.
So I had to choose another career,
and this was in fact relatively easy for me,
because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,
which was international relations.
As a child,
I read the newspaper thoroughly.
I was fascinated by the Cold War,
by the INF negotiations
over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.
in Angola or Afghanistan.
These things really interested me.
And so I decided quite at an early age
I wanted to be a diplomat.
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --
and my father denies this story to this day --
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."
And he turned to me, and he said,
"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."
(Laughter)
And my ambition was sealed.
I entered the British Foreign Service.
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,
and 20 of us succeeded.
And as those numbers suggest,
I was inducted into an elite
and fascinating and exhilarating world.
Being a diplomat, then and now,
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --
I enjoyed the status of it.
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes
and reveled in
this amazing access I had to world events.
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section
in the British Foreign Ministry.
I became a speechwriter
for the British Foreign Secretary.
I met Yasser Arafat.
I negotiated
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.
Later, I traveled to Kabul
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.
And I would travel
in a C-130 transport
and go and visit warlords
in mountain hideaways
and negotiate with them
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,
surrounded by my Special Forces escort,
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,
because it was so dangerous.
And that was exciting -- that was fun.
It was really interesting.
And it's a great cadre of people,
incredibly close-knit community of people.
was when I was posted to New York.
I'd already served in Germany, Norway,
various other places,
but I was posted to New York
to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.
And my responsibility was the Middle East,
which was my specialty.
And there, I dealt with things
like the Middle East peace process,
the Lockerbie issue --
we can talk about that later, if you wish --
but above all, my responsibility was Iraq
and its weapons of mass destruction
and the sanctions we placed on Iraq
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.
I was the chief British negotiator
on the subject,
and I was steeped in the issue.
And anyway,
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.
We went through several wars
during my time in New York.
I negotiated for my country
the resolution in the Security Council
of the 12th of September 2001
condemning the attacks of the day before,
which were, of course, deeply present to us
actually living in New York at the time.
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times
kind of experience.
I lived the high-life.
Although I worked very long hours,
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;
you can imagine what that might have meant.
(Laughter)
I had a good time.
when my tour came to an end,
I decided I wasn't going to go back
to the job that was waiting for me in London.
I decided to take a sabbatical,
in fact, at the New School, Bruce.
In some inchoate, inarticulate way
I realized that there was something wrong
with my work, with me.
I was exhausted,
and I was also disillusioned
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.
And I decided to take some time out from work.
The Foreign Office was very generous.
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.
It was nice.
And eventually, I decided
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,
which was then under U.N. administration.
which kind of, again,
shows the randomness of life,
because these things turned out to be
two of the pivots of my life
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.
But they were random things.
One was that, in the summer of 2004,
the British government, somewhat reluctantly,
decided to have an official inquiry
into the use of intelligence on WMD
in the run up to the Iraq War,
a very limited subject.
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq
and its WMD,
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:
that the government exaggerated the intelligence,
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear
that Iraq's WMD
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,
which in some ways
was a more discreditable thing still.
The third reason, I won't go into.
But anyway, I gave that testimony,
and that presented me with a crisis.
What was I going to do?
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,
of my ministers, who had, in my view
had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.
And this wasn't a pretty thing.
I moaned about it, I hesitated,
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,
where he goes back to CBS
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.
I felt just something's broken.
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face
and do what I used to do gladly for them.
So took a running leap
and jumped over the edge of a cliff.
And I started to fall.
And today, that fall hasn't stopped;
I'm still falling.
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.
And in a way, I kind of like
the sensation of it a lot better
than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,
wondering what to do.
A second thing happened in Kosovo,
which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.
A second thing happened in Kosovo,
which kind of delivered the answer,
which I couldn't really answer,
which is, "What do I do with my life?"
I love diplomacy --
I have no career --
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.
I wanted to be an ambassador,
and my mentors, my heroes,
people who got to the top of my profession,
and here I was throwing it all away.
A lot of my friends were still in it.
My pension was in it.
And I gave it up.
And what was I going to do?
this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.
In March 2004, there were terrible riots
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.
18 people were killed.
It was anarchy.
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,
to know that the police and the military --
there were lots of military troops there --
actually can't stop that rampaging mob
who's coming down the street.
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop
is when they decide to stop
and when they've had enough burning and killing.
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.
And that riot taught me something,
which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.
those riots, which went on for several days, took place --
was because the Kosovo people
were disenfranchised from their own future.
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo
going on then,
and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,
were not actually
participating in those talks.
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system,
this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,
and the Kosovars weren't part of it.
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.
It wasn't the only reason,
and life is not simple, one reason narratives.
It was a complicated thing,
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.
But that was one of the reasons.
or rather to be precise,
it gave my wife the inspiration.
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.
They were not allowed diplomats.
They were not allowed a foreign office
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.
And so that was the idea.
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,
the world's first diplomatic advisory group
and a non-profit to boot.
And it began when I flew back from London
after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,
"Yes, Carne. Come."
and advised the Kosovo government.
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers
and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.
And Kosovo became independent.
Independent Diplomat is now established
in five diplomatic centers around the world,
and we're advising seven or eight
different countries, or political groups,
depending on how you wish to define them --
and I'm not big on definitions.
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.
We're advising the Burmese opposition,
the government of Southern Sudan,
which -- you heard it here first --
is going to be a new country within the next few years.
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,
who are fighting to get their country back
from Moroccan occupation
after 34 years of dispossession.
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,
which is suppose to culminate
in Copenhagen.
because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,
I went to a party in the House of Lords,
which is a ridiculous place,
but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into
this guy who was standing behind me.
And we started talking, and he said --
I told him what I was doing,
and I told him rather grandly
I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.
At that time there was just me --
and me and my wife were moving back to New York.
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"
And it turned out
he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,
which some of you have probably heard of.
And one thing led to another,
and I ended up having a desk
in ?What If! in New York,
when I started Independent Diplomat.
And watching ?What If!
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley
or new flavors for Coke
actually helped me innovate
new strategies for the Kosovars
and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --
that diplomacy, like business,
is a business of solving problems,
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;
it's all zero sum games and realpolitik
and ancient institutions that have been there for generations
and do things the same way they've always done things.
tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.
And we use naive experts
who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,
but may know something about something else
to try to inject new thinking
into the problems
that we try to address for our clients.
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition,
are having a difficult time, diplomatically.
some lessons from all of this,
personal and political --
and in a way, they're the same thing.
The personal one
is falling off a cliff
is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life
just to tear everything up and jump.
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend
which is emerging and evident across the world,
which is that the world is fragmenting.
States mean less than they used to,
and the power of the state is declining.
That means the power of others things is rising.
Those other things are called non-state actors.
They may be corporations,
they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,
they may anything,
any number of things.
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.
If governments are less able
to affect the problems
that affect us in the world,
then that means, who is left to deal with them,
who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?
Us.
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.
it's no longer good enough
to say that international relations, or global affairs,
or chaos in Somalia,
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.
I can connect any one of you
by six degrees of separation
to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,
but that connection is there.
We are all intimately connected.
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,
it's actually provable in case after case after case.
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,
you have to look to yourself to do things.
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this
in a sort of loose way.
the way the world is changing
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --
the U.N. Security Council.
The U.N. was established in 1945.
Its charter is basically designed
to stop conflicts between states --
interstate conflict.
Today, 80 percent of the agenda
of the U.N. Security Council
is about conflicts within states,
involving non-state parties --
guerillas, separatists,
terrorists, if you want to call them that,
people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.
That is the state of the world today.
When I realized this,
and when I look back on my time at the Security Council
and what happened with the Kosovars,
and I realize that often
the people who were most directly affected
by what we were doing in the Security Council
weren't actually there, weren't actually invited
to give their views to the Security Council,
I thought, this is wrong.
Something's got to be done about this.
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat
went around the U.N. Security Council.
We went around 70 U.N. member states --
the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis --
you name them, we went to see them --
the secretary general, all of them,
and said, "This is all wrong.
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.
You've got to institutionalize a system
where you actually invite the Kosovars
to come and tell you what they think.
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,
which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."
Super-logical, you would think.
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.
Come back to us
in maybe six months."
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.
The Security Council does its business
in exactly the same way today
that it did X number of years ago,
when I was there 10 years ago.
of basically failure
and thought, what can we do about it.
And I thought, I'm buggered
if I'm going to spend the rest of my life
lobbying for these crummy governments
to do what needs to be done.
So what we're going to do
is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.
So now, Independent Diplomat
is in the process of setting up meetings
between the U.N. Security Council
and the parties to the disputes
that are on the agenda of the Security Council.
So we will be bringing
Darfuri rebel groups,
the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,
rebels from Aceh,
and awful long laundry list
of chaotic conflicts around the world.
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York
to sit down in a quiet room
in a private setting with no press
and actually explain what they want
to the members of the U. N. Security Council,
and for the members of the U.N. Security Council
to explain to them what they want.
So there's actually a conversation,
which has never before happened.
And of course, describing all this,
any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,
and I entirely agree with you.
The chances of failure are very high,
but it certainly won't happen
if we don't try to make it happen.
from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,
and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,
not technology, frankly, so much either.
Preach technology
to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations
who are now in political prison in Tehran,
where Ahmadinejad remains in power.
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,
"What can I do to produce that particular output?"
That is the politics of the 21st century,
and in a way, Independent Diplomat
embodies that fragmentation, that change,
that is happening to all of us.
The moment I say "school,"
so many memories come back to me.
It's like after every exam, when I walk out,
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.
How did you do?"
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."
And I didn't understand why,
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"
and I didn't know where else to find myself.
So I remember those nights
I used to go to sleep
with asking help from [the] Unknown
because, for some reason,
I couldn't believe what my father and mother
hanged in the Puja room as a god,
because my friend's family
had something else as a god.
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown
and ask help,"
and started getting help from everywhere,
each and every corner of my life at that time.
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.
around 13 years old,
I started working in a part-time job
in one of the signboard artists called Putu.
And then school also started supporting me.
"Oh, he's bad at studies,
but let him send to the drawing competitions."
So it was good to survive with that little tool
that I found to find my own place in school.
And one of those competitions,
I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.
And I didn't have the patience to wait
until I reached home.
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.
If you travel in Indian trains,
you can see people listening to radio
and, you know, even from their mobiles.
and I was listening to just radio,
and someone happened to sit next to me,
like these three people are sitting here.
You know, like just adjacent to me.
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.
I think
you should study in a school of art.
You just quit school and come there."
So, why I'm telling you this,
you know, maybe, you know,
So that's what made me enter
[the] college of arts after three attempts
and just continue to inquire
what I really want to do with art work, or art
and finally I'm here in front of you.
on what happened between that time
and now here --
the last 10/15 years --
I can see that most of the works
revolve around three subjects,
but it was not intentional.
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,
"What really makes us?" -- you know,
it's actually [the] past, what makes a person.
So I was thinking,
but when you look at the past,
the way to understand the past
is only by the traces available,
because we cannot go back [to] the past.
It can be ruins, or it can be music,
or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.
And that fascinated me,
to explore that territory.
So I was working on the line,
but instead of working about traces,
I started capturing traces.
So this is called "Self In Progress."
It's just a trace of being in this body.
So here, what happened then,
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most
is that this sculpture
is nothing but a trace of myself.
It's almost like a 3D photograph.
So there is an element of performance,
and there is an element of sculpture,
and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.
So it's almost like fossils for the future.
And then moved slowly
to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.
So this is what I was talking about, while molding,
it's such a great experience,
because we have freedom of like walking,
or moving my hand or, moving around in the space,
but the moment this becomes solid,
when you cannot move even an inch,
because, knowingly or unknowingly,
whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture
thumbprint, footprint,
or whatever traces we leave as humans."
This is the trace of fire,
this is the trace of sun.
Because when I was capturing traces, you know,
this thought comes to me always:
is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,
or is there other ways to capture it?"
So this work is nothing but like --
because of the focal length of the lens,
it just shows what is on the other side.
So I just put the paper on the focal length,
which was an etching print,
then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper
then put a coconut rope,
and just burnt it.
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.
So wherever the fire is eating the paper,
that's what becomes the work --
detail.
when we try to understand them,
the perception and context
play a major role to understand it.
So do we really understand what it is,
or are we trying to get
what we think it is?
Then move towards questioning the perception
because, even though there are traces,
when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.
So like let's say even a simple act.
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India
while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?
Can you just raise the hand?
of how, everyone can interpret it.
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,
she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.
He would say, "For the greater good."
Martin Luther King would say,
"I imagine a world where all cows will be free
to cross the road,
without having their motives called into question."
(Laughter)
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees
the same cow walking around the street.
He would definitely say,
"God came down from heaven,
and he said unto the cow,
'Thou shalt cross the road.'
And cow crossed the road,
and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."
(Laughter)
Freud would say,
"The fact that you're at all concerned
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."
(Laughter)
If we ask Einstein,
he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,
or the road moved underneath the cow,
depends on your frame of reference."
(Laughter)
Or Buddha --
if he saw the same cow, he would say,
"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."
is just what we think often,
and most of the time, we don't see what it is.
It just all depends on one's perception.
And context, what is really context?
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.
If you look at this piece of paper,
this is the breadth
and this is called length.
This is how we've been taught in school.
But if you tear it in the middle --
now, I didn't touch this breadth,
but still, the meaning of this changes.
So what we conceive as a meaning
is always not there;
it's on the other side,
even when we say dark, light,
good, bad, tall, short --
all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.
It's just that being a human,
the way we train to perceive the reality
creates this meaning.
is mostly like --
you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."
It's just captured through from the lamp.
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.
This is called "Limit Out."
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch --
do we really see?
This is an exact negative.
It's about six inches deep in the wall,
but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.
You know the wall is almost like --
this is the first skin, and this is the second,
Again, "Inward Out."
It's a full-figure cast from myself.
It's about eight inches deep.
and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception --
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,
it just makes me feel like:
is there anything behind, are there any traces up there,
which as a human, we don't see them?
Is there any way to capture the thought
into visual art?
I couldn't find it.
But a solution arrived
after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,
in the restroom,
when I was changing the air freshener
that goes from solid substance to vapor.
It's called Odonil.
This is the work I made out of that material.
who produces that air freshener called Odonil,
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"
They never wrote back to me.
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries
Facilitating Unit and ask help."
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."
They said, "Of course.
This is the fee for the project report,
"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.
Please come for the show."
And they did.
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.
they always talk about the appreciation of art.
You buy this for 3,000 rupees,
it'll become 30,000 in two months.
This is the craft that was going on,
but there are a few collectors
who also collect art which can depreciate.
And this was collected by Anupam --
So this is after a few weeks,
this is after a few months.
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"
it may not be the portrait after a few months.
And if they say it's solid,
it will not be solid, it will evaporate.
And if they say they don't get it,
that's also not true,
because it's in the air.
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.
So they inhaled it,
but they are not aware of it.
my mom and my dad,
they were looking at it and they said,
"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"
And I was like, "What do you mean?"
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,
"this is tucked in some small solid,
but the moment it evaporates,
it's merged with the whole."
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.
Can you make something from nothing
as a sculptor?"
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.
Because we can create
a sculpture
by gathering dust together,
or we can break the sculpture and get the dust,
but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."
It's called "Emerging Angel."
This is the first day --
it just gives the appearance
that one is becoming the other.
So, the same sculpture
after a few days.
This is after 15/20 days.
Through that small little slit
between the glass box and the wood,
the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.
This gave me a greater faith.
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith
that maybe there is many more possibilities
to capture [the] invisible.
is called "Shadow Foreshadow."
And what I'd like to tell you
is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;
we see the source of the light.
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark,
but it's filled with light all the time.
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.
The same thing in the darkroom.
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light,
and we realize the existence of light.
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,
we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.
So, I just started doing this work
to inquire further
about how to sculpt
the space between this object and there.
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that --
but how to sculpt this, you know?
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.
The skin of this is also representing this.
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.
I did this as an experiment
of casting the shadow.
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.
Then the second one --
the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world
it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.
So that produced a shadow.
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.
Then, again, that becomes an object.
Again, throwing light, then the third one.
So what you see is nothing but shadow
of a shadow of a shadow.
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."
You can see the detail.
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.
It's a false wall, which contains
like 110 cubic feet.
So that hole actually
makes the air come out and go in.
So where it's happening, we can see,
but what is happening will remain invisible only.
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.
This is called "Kaayam."
Detail.
our senses are so limited --
we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.
We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"
but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.
So all of our construction of reality
is through these limited senses.
So my request was like,
is there any way to use all this
as just a symbol or a sign?
And to really get to the point,
we should move beyond, you know,
go to the other side of the wall, like illogic,
like are invisible.
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,
you will miss the point
because the actual journey happens between those footprints,
and the footprints are nothing but passing time.
Well, that's kind of an obvious statement up there.
I started with that sentence about 12 years ago,
and I started in the context
of developing countries,
but you're sitting here from every corner of the world.
So if you think of a map of your country,
I think you'll realize
that for every country on Earth,
you could draw little circles to say,
"These are places where good teachers won't go."
On top of that,
those are the places from where trouble comes.
So we have an ironic problem --
good teachers don't want to go
to just those places where they're needed the most.
to try and address this problem with an experiment,
which was a very simple experiment in New Delhi.
I basically embedded a computer
into a wall of a slum in New Delhi.
The children barely went to school, they didn't know any English --
they'd never seen a computer before,
and they didn't know what the internet was.
I connected high speed internet to it -- it's about three feet off the ground --
turned it on and left it there.
After this,
we noticed a couple of interesting things, which you'll see.
But I repeated this all over India
and then through
a large part of the world
and noticed
that children will learn to do
what they want to learn to do.
eight year-old boy on your right
teaching his student, a six year-old girl,
and he was teaching her how to browse.
This boy here in the middle of central India --
this is in a Rajasthan village,
where the children recorded their own music
and then played it back to each other
and in the process,
they've enjoyed themselves thoroughly.
They did all of this in four hours
after seeing the computer for the first time.
In another South Indian village,
these boys here
had assembled a video camera
and were trying to take the photograph of a bumble bee.
They downloaded it from Disney.com,
or one of these websites,
14 days after putting the computer in their village.
So at the end of it,
we concluded that groups of children
can learn to use computers and the internet on their own,
irrespective of who
or where they were.
and decided to see
what else could children do with a computer.
We started off with an experiment in Hyderabad, India,
where I gave a group of children --
they spoke English with a very strong Telugu accent.
I gave them a computer
with a speech-to-text interface,
which you now get free with Windows,
and asked them to speak into it.
So when they spoke into it,
the computer typed out gibberish,
so they said, "Well, it doesn't understand anything of what we are saying."
So I said, "Yeah, I'll leave it here for two months.
Make yourself understood
to the computer."
So the children said, "How do we do that."
And I said,
"I don't know, actually."
(Laughter)
And I left.
(Laughter)
Two months later --
and this is now documented
in the Information Technology
for International Development journal --
that accents had changed
and were remarkably close to the neutral British accent
in which I had trained the speech-to-text synthesizer.
In other words, they were all speaking like James Tooley.
(Laughter)
So they could do that on their own.
After that, I started to experiment
with various other things
that they might learn to do on their own.
from the late Arthur C. Clarke,
who said, "I want to see what's going on."
And he couldn't travel, so I went over there.
He said two interesting things,
"A teacher that can be replaced by a machine should be."
(Laughter)
The second thing he said was that,
"If children have interest,
then education happens."
And I was doing that in the field,
so every time I would watch it and think of him.
help people,
because children quickly learn to navigate
the web and find things which interest them.
And when you've got interest, then you have education.
This is a 15 year-old boy.
like animals,
and I listen to music.
And he said, "Yes, and they hop across the ocean."
This is in Cambodia,
rural Cambodia --
a fairly silly arithmetic game,
which no child would play inside the classroom or at home.
They would, you know, throw it back at you.
They'd say, "This is very boring."
If you leave it on the pavement
and if all the adults go away,
then they will show off with each other
about what they can do.
This is what these children are doing.
They are trying to multiply, I think.
And all over India,
at the end of about two years,
children were beginning to Google their homework.
As a result, the teachers reported
tremendous improvements in their English --
(Laughter)
rapid improvement and all sorts of things.
They said, "They have become really deep thinkers and so on and so forth.
(Laughter)
And indeed they had.
I mean, if there's stuff on Google,
why would you need to stuff it into your head?
So at the end of the next four years,
I decided that groups of children can navigate the internet
to achieve educational objectives on their own.
had come into Newcastle University
to improve schooling in India.
So Newcastle gave me a call. I said, "I'll do it from Delhi."
They said, "There's no way you're going to handle
a million pounds-worth of University money
sitting in Delhi."
So in 2006,
I bought myself a heavy overcoat
and moved to Newcastle.
I wanted to test the limits
of the system.
The first experiment I did out of Newcastle
was actually done in India.
And I set myself and impossible target:
can Tamil speaking
12-year-old children
in a South Indian village
teach themselves biotechnology
in English on their own?
And I thought, I'll test them, they'll get a zero --
I'll give the materials, I'll come back and test them --
they get another zero,
I'll go back and say, "Yes, we need teachers for certain things."
They all came in there, and I told them
that there's some really difficult stuff on this computer.
I wouldn't be surprised if you didn't understand anything.
It's all in English, and I'm going.
(Laughter)
So I left them with it.
I came back after two months,
and the 26 children marched in looking very, very quiet.
I said, "Well, did you look at any of the stuff?"
They said, "Yes, we did."
"Did you understand anything?" "No, nothing."
So I said,
"Well, how long did you practice on it
before you decided you understood nothing?"
They said, "We look at it every day."
So I said, "For two months, you were looking at stuff you didn't understand?"
So a 12 year-old girl raises her hand and says,
literally,
"Apart from the fact that improper replication of the DNA molecule
causes genetic disease,
we've understood nothing else."
It's just been published in the British Journal of Educational Technology.
One of the referees who refereed the paper said,
"It's too good to be true,"
which was not very nice.
Well, one of the girls had taught herself
to become the teacher.
And then that's her over there.
Remember, they don't study English.
I edited out the last bit when I asked, "Where is the neuron?"
and she says, "The neuron? The neuron,"
and then she looked and did this.
Whatever the expression, it was not very nice.
which is an educational impossibility under the circumstances.
But 30 percent is not a pass.
So I found that they had a friend,
a local accountant, a young girl,
and they played football with her.
I asked that girl, "Would you teach them
enough biotechnology to pass?"
And she said, "How would I do that? I don't know the subject."
I said, "No, use the method of the grandmother."
She said, "What's that?"
I said, "Well, what you've got to do
is stand behind them
and admire them all the time.
Just say to them, 'That's cool. That's fantastic.
What is that? Can you do that again? Can you show me some more?'"
She did that for two months.
The scores went up to 50,
which is what the posh schools of New Delhi,
with a trained biotechnology teacher were getting.
with these results
and decided
that there was something happening here
that definitely was getting very serious.
So, having experimented in all sorts of remote places,
I came to the most remote place that I could think of.
(Laughter)
Approximately 5,000 miles from Delhi
is the little town of Gateshead.
In Gateshead, I took 32 children
and I started to fine-tune the method.
I made them into groups of four.
I said, "You make your own groups of four.
Each group of four can use one computer and not four computers."
Remember, from the Hole in the Wall.
"You can exchange groups.
You can walk across to another group,
if you don't like your group, etc.
You can go to another group, peer over their shoulders, see what they're doing,
come back to you own group and claim it as your own work."
And I explained to them
that, you know, a lot of scientific research is done using that method.
"Now, what do you want us to do?"
I gave them six GCSE questions.
The first group -- the best one --
solved everything in 20 minutes.
The worst, in 45.
They used everything that they knew --
news groups, Google, Wikipedia,
Ask Jeeves, etc.
The teachers said, "Is this deep learning?"
I said, "Well, let's try it.
I'll come back after two months.
We'll give them a paper test --
no computers, no talking to each other, etc."
The average score when I'd done it with the computers and the groups
was 76 percent.
When I did the experiment, when I did the test,
after two months, the score
was 76 percent.
There was photographic recall
inside the children,
I suspect because they're discussing with each other.
A single child in front of a single computer
will not do that.
I have further results,
which are almost unbelievable,
of scores which go up with time.
Because their teachers say
that after the session is over,
the children continue to Google further.
for British grandmothers,
after my Kuppam experiment.
Well, you know,
they're very vigorous people, British grandmothers.
200 of them volunteered immediately.
(Laughter)
The deal was that they would give me
one hour of broadband time,
sitting in their homes,
one day in a week.
So they did that,
and over the last two years,
over 600 hours of instruction
has happened over Skype,
using what my students call the granny cloud.
The granny cloud sits over there.
I can beam them to whichever school I want to.
You say it.
You can't catch me.
a 10-year-old girl gets into the heart of Hinduism
in 15 minutes.
You know, stuff which I don't know anything about.
Two children watch a TEDTalk.
They wanted to be footballers before.
After watching eight TEDTalks,
he wants to become Leonardo da Vinci.
they're called SOLEs: Self Organized Learning Environments.
The furniture is designed
so that children can sit in front of big, powerful screens,
big broadband connections, but in groups.
If they want, they can call the granny cloud.
This is a SOLE in Newcastle.
The mediator is from Pune, India.
I went to Turin in May.
I sent all the teachers away from my group of 10 year-old students.
I speak only English, they speak only Italian,
so we had no way to communicate.
I started writing English questions on the blackboard.
The children looked at it and said, "What?"
I said, "Well, do it."
They typed it into Google, translated it into Italian,
went back into Italian Google.
Fifteen minutes later --
next question: where is Calcutta?
This one, they took only 10 minutes.
I tried a really hard one then.
Who was Pythagoras, and what did he do?
There was silence for a while,
then they said, "You've spelled it wrong.
It's Pitagora."
And then,
in 20 minutes,
the right-angled triangles began to appear on the screens.
This sent shivers up my spine.
These are 10 year-olds.
Text: In another 30 minutes they would reach the Theory of Relativity. And then?
I think we've just stumbled across
a self-organizing system.
A self-organizing system is one
where a structure appears
without explicit intervention from the outside.
Self-organizing systems also always show emergence,
which is that the system starts to do things,
which it was never designed for.
Which is why you react the way you do,
because it looks impossible.
I think I can make a guess now --
education is self-organizing system,
where learning is an emergent phenomenon.
It'll take a few years to prove it, experimentally,
but I'm going to try.
But in the meanwhile, there is a method available.
One billion children, we need 100 million mediators --
there are many more than that on the planet --
10 million SOLEs,
180 billion dollars and 10 years.
We could change everything.
This strange-looking plant is called the Llareta.
What looks like moss covering rocks
is actually a shrub
comprised of thousands of branches,
each containing clusters of tiny green leaves at the end
and so densely packed together
that you could actually stand on top of it.
This individual lives in the Atacama Desert in Chile,
and it happens to be 3,000 years old.
It also happens to be a relative of parsley.
working with biologists
and traveling all over the world
to find continuously living organisms
that are 2,000 years old and older.
The project is part art and part science.
There's an environmental component.
And I'm also trying to create a means
in which to step outside our quotidian experience of time
and to start to consider a deeper timescale.
I selected 2,000 years as my minimum age
because I wanted to start at what we consider to be year zero
and work backward from there.
living on the remote island of Yakushima.
The tree was in part a catalyst for the project.
I'd been traveling in Japan
without an agenda other than to photograph,
and then I heard about this tree
that is 2,180 years old
and knew that I had to go visit it.
It wasn't until later, when I was actually back home in New York
that I got the idea for the project.
So it was the slow churn, if you will.
I think it was my longstanding desire
to bring together my interest
in art, science and philosophy
that allowed me to be ready
when the proverbial light bulb went on.
So I started researching, and to my surprise,
this project had never been done before
in the arts or the sciences.
And -- perhaps naively --
I was surprised to find that there isn't even an area in the sciences
that deals with this idea
of global species longevity.
is the rhizocarpon geographicum, or map lichen,
and this is around 3,000 years old
and lives in Greenland,
which is a long way to go for some lichens.
Visiting Greenland was more like
traveling back in time
than just traveling very far north.
It was very primal and more remote
than anything I'd ever experienced before.
And this is heightened by a couple of particular experiences.
One was when I had been dropped off by boat
on a remote fjord,
only to find that the archeologists I was supposed to meet
were nowhere to be found.
And it's not like you could send them a text or shoot them an e-mail,
so I was literally left to my own devices.
But luckily, it worked out obviously,
but it was a humbling experience
to feel so disconnected.
And then a few days later,
we had the opportunity to go fishing in a glacial stream
near our campsite,
where the fish were so abundant
that you could literally reach into the stream
and grab out a foot-long trout with your bare hands.
It was like visiting
a more innocent time on the planet.
And then, of course, there's the lichens.
These lichens grow only one centimeter
every hundred years.
I think that really puts human lifespans
into a different perspective.
is an aerial photo take over eastern Oregon.
And if the title "Searching for Armillaria Death Rings,"
sounds ominous, it is.
The Armillaria is actually a predatory fungus,
killing certain species of trees in the forest.
It's also more benignly known
as the honey mushroom or the "humongous fungus"
because it happens to be
one of the world's largest organisms as well.
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus,
I got some maps and some GPS coordinates
and chartered a plane
and started looking for the death rings,
the circular patterns
in which the fungus kills the trees.
So I'm not sure if there are any in this photo,
but I do know the fungus is down there.
And then this back down on the ground
and you can see that the fungus is actually invading this tree.
So that white material that you see
in between the bark and the wood
is the mycelial felt of the fungus,
and what it's doing -- it's actually
slowly strangling the tree to death
by preventing the flow of water and nutrients.
So this strategy has served it pretty well --
it's 2,400 years old.
And then from underground to underwater.
that's around 2,000 years old.
And I had to overcome my fear of deep water to find this one.
This is at about 60 feet
or 18 meters, depth.
And you'll see, there's some damage to the surface of the coral.
That was actually caused by a school of parrot fish
that had started eating it,
though luckily, they lost interest before killing it.
Luckily still, it seems to be out of harm's way
of the recent oil spill.
But that being said, we just as easily could have lost
one of the oldest living things on the planet,
and the full impact of that disaster
is still yet to be seen.
is one of the most quietly resilient things on the planet.
This is clonal colony
of Quaking Aspen trees, living in Utah,
that is literally 80,000 years old.
What looks like a forest
is actually only one tree.
Imagine that it's one giant root system
and each tree is a stem
coming up from that system.
So what you have is one giant,
interconnected,
genetically identical individual
that's been living for 80,000 years.
It also happens to be male
and, in theory immortal.
This is the spruce Gran Picea,
which at 9,550 years
is a mere babe in the woods.
The location of this tree
is actually kept secret for its own protection.
I spoke to the biologist who discovered this tree,
and he told me that that spindly growth you see there in the center
is most likely a product of climate change.
As it's gotten warmer on the top of the mountain,
the vegetation zone is actually changing.
So we don't even necessarily have to have
direct contact with these organisms
to have a very real impact on them.
no, I'm just kidding --
this is the Fortingall Yew.
(Laughter)
But I put that slide in there
because I'm often asked if there are any animals in the project.
And aside from coral,
the answer is no.
Does anybody know how old the oldest tortoise is --
any guesses?
(Audience: 300.)
Rachel Sussman: 300? No, 175
is the oldest living tortoise,
so nowhere near 2,000.
And then, you might have heard
of this giant clam that was discovered
off the coast of northern Iceland
that reached 405 years old.
However, it died in the lab
as they were determining its age.
The most interesting discovery of late, I think
is the so-called immortal jellyfish,
which has actually been observed in the lab
to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state
after reaching full maturity.
So that being said,
it's highly unlikely that any jellyfish would survive that long in the wild.
And back to the yew here.
So as you can see, it's in a churchyard;
it's in Scotland. It's behind a protective wall.
And there are actually a number or ancient yews
in churchyards around the U.K.,
but if you do the math, you'll remember
it's actually the yew trees that were there first, then the churches.
I had the opportunity to travel around the Limpopo Province in South Africa
with an expert in Baobab trees.
And we saw a number of them,
and this is most likely the oldest.
It's around 2,000,
and it's called the Sagole Baobab.
And you know, I think of all of these organisms
as palimpsests.
They contain thousands of years
of their own histories within themselves,
and they also contain records of natural and human events.
And the Baobabs in particular
are a great example of this.
You can see that this one
has names carved into its trunk,
but it also records some natural events.
So the Baobabs, as they get older,
tend to get pulpy in their centers and hollow out.
And this can create
great natural shelters for animals,
but they've also been appropriated
for some rather dubious human uses,
including a bar, a prison
and even a toilet inside of a tree.
I think, because it is just so unusual.
This plant is called the Welwitschia,
and it lives only in parts of coastal Namibia and Angola,
where it's uniquely adapted
to collect moisture from mist coming off the sea.
And what's more, it's actually a tree.
It's a primitive conifer.
You'll notice that it's bearing cones down the center.
And what looks like two big heaps of leaves,
is actually two single leaves
that get shredded up
by the harsh desert conditions over time.
And it actually never sheds those leaves,
so it also bears the distinction
of having the longest leaves
in the plant kingdom.
I spoke to a biologist
at the Kirstenbosch Botanical Garden in Capetown
to ask him
where he thought this remarkable plant came from,
and his thought was that
if you travel around Namibia,
you see that there are a number of petrified forests,
and the logs are all --
the logs are all giant coniferous trees,
and yet there's no sign of where they might have come from.
So his thought was that
flooding in the north of Africa
actually brought those coniferous trees down
tens of thousands of years ago,
and what resulted was this remarkable adaptation
to this unique desert environment.
This is something called an underground forest.
So, I spoke to a botanist at the Pretoria Botanical Garden,
who explained that certain species of trees
have adapted to this region.
It's bushfelt region,
which is dry and prone to a lot of fires,
as so what these trees have done
is, if you can imagine that this is the crown of the tree,
and that this is ground level,
imagine that the whole thing,
that whole bulk of the tree,
migrated underground,
and you just have those leaves peeping up above the surface.
That way, when a fire roars through,
it's the equivalent of getting your eyebrows singed.
The tree can easily recover.
These also tend to grow clonally,
the oldest of which is 13,000 years old.
This is the clonal Creosote bush,
which is around 12,000 years old.
If you've been in the American West,
you know the Creosote bush is pretty ubiquitous,
but that being said, you see that this has
this unique, circular form.
And what's happening is it's expanding slowly outwards
from that original shape.
And it's one -- again, that interconnected root system,
making it one genetically identical individual.
It also has a friend nearby --
well, I think they're friends.
This is the clonal Mojave yucca, it's about a mile away,
and it's a little bit older than 12,000 years.
And you see it has that similar circular form.
And there's some younger clones
dotting the landscape behind it.
And both of these, the yucca and the Creosote bush,
live on Bureau of Land Management land,
and that's very different from being protected in a national park.
In fact, this land is designated
for recreational all-terrain vehicle use.
the oldest living thing on the planet.
This is Siberian Actinobacteria,
which is between 400,000
and 600,000 years old.
This bacteria was discovered several years ago
by a team of planetary biologists
hoping to find clues to life on other planets
by looking at one of the harshest conditions on ours.
And what they found, by doing research into the permafrost,
was this bacteria.
But what's unique about it is that
it's doing DNA repair below freezing.
And what that means is that it's not dormant --
it's actually been living and growing
for half a million years.
It's also probably one the most vulnerable
of the oldest living things,
because if the permafrost melts,
it won't survive.
so you can get a sense of where they are; you see they're all over the world.
The blue flags represent things that I've already photographed,
and the reds are places that I'm still trying to get to.
You'll see also, there's a flag on Antarctica.
I'm trying to travel there
to find 5,000 year-old moss,
which lives on the Antarctic Peninsula.
on this project --
on this phase of the project,
but after five years,
I really feel like I know what's at the heart of this work.
The oldest living things in the world
are a record and celebration of our past,
a call to action in the present
and a barometer of our future.
They've survived for millennia
in desert, in the permafrost,
at the tops of mountains and at the bottom of the ocean.
They've withstood
untold natural perils and human encroachments,
but now some of them are in jeopardy,
and they can't just get up and get out of the way.
It's my hope that, by going to find these organisms,
that I can help draw attention
to their remarkable resilience
and help play a part in insuring
their continued longevity into the foreseeable future.
For real -- you can take a second. You've got to feel this to learn it.
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you're going to do.
Imagine their congratulations,
and their high image of you.
Doesn't it feel good to say it out loud?
Don't you feel one step closer already,
because that good feeling
Ideally you would not be satisfied until you'd actually done the work.
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it,
psychologists have found that it's called a "social reality."
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it's already done.
that we should tell our friends our goals, right?
So they hold us to it.
1982, Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this,
and in 2009,
he did some new tests that were published.
163 people across four separate tests.
Everyone wrote down their personal goal.
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room,
and half didn't.
but they were told that they could stop at any time.
Now, those who kept their mouths shut
worked the entire 45 minutes on average,
and when asked afterward,
But those who had announced it
quit after only 33 minutes, on average,
and when asked afterward,
said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal.
But if you do need to talk about something,
Tyler Dewar: The way I feel right now
is that all of the other speakers
have said exactly what I wanted to say.
(Laughter)
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say
is to thank you all for your kindness.
of appreciating the kindness of you all,
I could share with you
a little story about myself.
I was given
a lot of different responsibilities,
and it always seemed to me, when I was young,
that everything was laid out before me.
All of the plans for me were already made.
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear
and told where I needed to be,
given these very precious
and holy looking robes to wear,
with the understanding
that it was something sacred or important.
I was living in eastern Tibet with my family.
And when I was seven years old,
all of a sudden,
a search party arrived at my home.
They were looking the next Karmapa,
and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad,
and the news came to me that they were telling me
that I was the Karmapa.
And these days, people ask me a lot,
how did that feel.
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away,
and your lifestyle completely changed?
And what I mostly say is that,
at that time,
it was a pretty interesting idea to me.
I thought that things would be pretty fun
and there would be more things to play with.
as I thought it would have been.
I was placed
in a pretty strictly controlled environment.
And immediately,
a lot of different responsibilities,
in terms of my education and so forth, were heaped upon me.
I was separated, largely, from my family,
including my mother and father.
I didn't have have many personal friends
to spend time with,
but I was expected to perform
these prescribed duties.
So it turned out that my fantasy
about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa
wasn't going to come true.
It more felt to be the case to me
that I was being treated like a statue,
and I was to sit in one place
like a statue would.
even though I've been separated from my loved ones --
and, of course, now I'm even further away.
When I was 14, I escaped from Tibet
and became even further removed
from my mother and father,
my relatives, my friends
and my homeland.
But nevertheless,
there's no real sense of separation from me in my heart,
in terms of the love that I feel
for these people.
I feel, still, a very strong connection of love
for all of these people
and for the land.
get to keep in touch with my mother and father,
albeit infrequently.
I talk to my mother
once in a blue moon on the telephone.
And my experience is that,
when I'm talking to her,
with every second that passes
during our conversation,
the feeling of love that binds us
is bringing us closer and closer together.
about my personal background.
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you,
in terms of ideas,
I think it's wonderful to have a situation like this,
where so many people from different backgrounds and places
can come together,
exchange their ideas
and form relationships of friendship with each other.
And I think that's symbolic
of what we're seeing in the world in general,
that the world is becoming smaller and smaller,
and that all of the peoples in the world
are enjoying more opportunities for connection.
That's wonderful,
but we should also remember
that we should have a similar process happening on the inside.
Along with outward development
and increase of opportunity,
there should be inward development
and deepening of our heart connections
as well as our outward connections.
So we spoke and we heard some
about design this week.
I think that it's important for us to remember
that we need
to keep pushing forward
on the endeavor
of the design of the heart.
We heard a lot about technology this week,
and it's important for us to remember
to invest a lot of our energy
in improving the technology of the heart.
about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world,
still, I feel a sense of impediment,
when it comes
to the ability that we have
to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart, or a mind-to-mind, level.
I feel that there are some things
that are getting in the way.
to this concept of heart-to-heart connection, or mind-to-mind connection,
is an interesting one,
because, as a spiritual leader, I'm always attempting
to open my heart to others
and offer myself up
for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections
in a genuine way with other people,
but at the same time,
I've always been advised
that I need to emphasize intelligence
over the heart-to-heart connections,
because, being someone in a position like mine,
if I don't rely primarily on intelligence,
then something dangerous may happen to me.
So it's an interesting paradox at play there.
But I had a really striking experience once,
when a group from Afghanistan
came to visit me,
and we had a really interesting conversation.
which, as you know,
were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan.
But the basis of our conversation
was the different approach to spirituality
on the part of the Muslim
and Buddhist traditions.
Of course, in Muslim,
because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry,
you don't find as many
physical representations of divinity
or of spiritual liberation
as you do in the Buddhist tradition,
where, of course, there are many statues of the Buddha
that are highly revered.
So, we were talking about the differences
between the traditions
and what many people perceived
as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas,
but I offered the suggestion
that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way.
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas
was the depletion of matter,
some solid substance
falling down and disintegrating.
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar
to the falling of the Berlin Wall,
where a divide
that had kept two types of people apart
had collapsed and opened up a door
for further communication.
So I think that, in this way,
it's always possible for us
to derive something positive
that can help us understand one another better.
that we've been talking about
here at this conference,
I really feel
that the development that we make
shouldn't create a further burden
for us as human beings,
but should be used
to improve
our fundamental lifestyle
of how we live in the world.
in the development and the growth and the rise
of the noble land of India, the great country of India,
but at the same time, I think,
as some of us have acknowledged,
we need to be aware
that some aspects of this rise
are coming at the cost
of the very ground
on which we stand.
So, as we are climbing the tree,
some of the things that we're doing
in order to climb the tree
are actually undermining
the tree's very root.
And so,
what I think it comes down to
is a question of, not only having information of what's going on,
but paying attention to that
and letting that shift our motivation
to become more sincere
and genuinely positive.
We have hear, this week,
about the horrible sufferings, for example,
that so many women of the world
are enduring day-to-day.
We have that information,
but what often happens to us
is that we don't really choose to pay attention to it.
We don't really choose to allow that
to cause there to be a shift in our hearts.
So I think the way forward for the world --
one that will bring the path of outer development
in harmony
with the real root of happiness --
is that we allow
the information that we have
to really make a change in our heart.
is very important for our future well-being,
or deep sense of well-being as humans,
and I think that means sinking in
to whatever it is you're doing now.
Whatever work you're trying to do now to benefit the world,
sink into that,
get a full taste of that.
we've taken millions of breaths, collectively,
and perhaps we haven't witnessed
any course changes
happening in our lives,
but we often miss the very subtle changes.
And I think
that sometimes we develop
grand concepts
of what happiness
might look like for us,
but that, if we pay attention,
we can see that there are little symbols of happiness
in every breath that we take.
is so talented,
and you have so much to offer to the world,
I think it would be a good note to conclude on then
to just take a moment
to appreciate how fortunate we are
to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas
and really form a strong aspiration
and energy within ourselves
that we will take the good
that has come from this conference,
the momentum, the positivity,
and we will spread that and plant it
in all of the corners of the world.
even in inviting me,
let alone everything else that she has done
to make this happen,
and I was somewhat resistant at times,
and I was also very nervous throughout this week.
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth,
and people would ask me, why.
I would tell them, "It's because I have to talk tomorrow."
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that,
but I very much appreciate
the opportunity she's given me
to be here.
And to you, everyone, thank you very much.
putting unprecedented pressure
on the systems on Earth.
We're the first generation -- thanks to science --
to be informed that we may be
to support human development as we know it.
It's also good news, because the planetary risks we're facing
In fact, we're in a phase
to have her as a witness
of a remarkable journey,
which humbly reminds us
of the period of grace we've had
over the past 10,000 years.
This is the living conditions on the planet over the last 100,000 years.
It's a very important period --
it's roughly half the period when we've been fully modern humans on the planet.
We've had the same, roughly, abilities
It was a jumpy ride. 80,000 years back in a crisis,
we leave Africa, we colonize Australia
in another crisis, 60,000 years back,
we leave Asia for Europe
in another crisis, 40,000 years back,
the only period in the whole history of the planet,
that we know of, that can support human development.
A thousand years into this period,
we abandon our hunting and gathering patterns.
We go from a couple of million people
to the seven billion people we are today.
The Mesopotamian culture: we invent agriculture,
we domesticate animals and plants.
You have the Roman, the Greek and the story as you know it.
The only phase, as we know it
that can support humanity.
a quadruple sqeeze, which, as its first squeeze,
has population growth of course.
Now, this is not only about numbers;
this is not only about the fact that we're seven billion people
committed to nine billion people, it's an equity issue as well.
The majority of the environmental impacts on the planet
have been caused by the rich minority,
The majority of the planet,
aspiring for development, having the right for development,
are in large aspiring for an unsustainable lifestyle,
the big issue -- where the policy interpretation of science
is that it would be enough
to stabilize greenhouse gases at 450 ppm
to avoid average temperatures
exceeding two degrees,
to avoid the risk that we may be destabilizing
the West Antarctic Ice Sheet,
holding another seven meters -- sea level rising.
Now, you would have wished the climate pressure
to hit a strong planet, a resilient planet,
but unfortunately, the third pressure
is the ecosystem decline.
Never have we seen, in the past 50 years,
such a sharp decline
of ecosystem functions and services on the planet,
one of them being the ability to regulate climate on the long term,
that ecosystems behave linearly, predictably,
controllably in our -- so to say -- linear systems,
and that in fact, surprise is universal,
as systems tip over very rapidly, abruptly
and often irreversibly.
We may, in fact, have entered a new geological era --
what's the evidence for this?
It's not only carbon dioxide
that has this hockey stick pattern of accelerated change.
You can take virtually any parameter
that matters for human well-being --
nitrous oxide, methane,
deforestation, overfishing
land degredation, loss of species --
they all show the same pattern
over the past 200 years.
Simultaneously, they branch off in the mid-50s,
10 years after the Second World War,
showing very clearly that the great acceleration of the human enterprise
starts in the mid-50s.
You see, for the first time, an imprint on the global level.
And I can tell you,
you enter the disciplinary research in each of these,
you find something remarkably important,
the conclusion that we may have come to the point
where we have to bend the curves,
that we may have entered the most challenging and exciting decade
in the history humanity on the planet,
the decade when we have to bend the curves.
to just bend the curves and understanding the accelerated pressure on the planet --
we also have to recognize the fact
that systems do have multiple stable states,
separated by thresholds -- illustrated here by this ball and cup diagram,
where the depth of the cup is the resilience of the system.
Now, the system may gradually --
under pressure of climate change,
erosion, biodiversity loss --
lose the depth of the cup, the resilience,
but appear to be healthy
and appear to suddenly, under a threshold,
be tipping over. Upff.
Sorry. Changing state
and literally ending up
in an undesired situation,
Biodiverse, low-nutrient, hard coral systems
loses its resilience,
soft corals take over,
and we get undesired systems
that cannot support economic and social development.
The Arctic -- a beautiful system --
a regulating biome at the planetary level,
taking the knock after knock on climate change,
suddenly, what could be crossing a threshold.
And the drama is, of course, that
when the system does this, the logic may change.
It may get locked in an undesired state,
As a sideline, you know that the only red flag that popped up here
was a submarine from an unnamed country
that wetlands, forests,
[unclear] monsoon system, the rainforests,
behave in this nonlinear way.
30 or so scientists around the world
gathered and asked a question for the first time,
are we threatening this extraordinarily stable Holocene state?
Are we in fact putting ourselves in a situation
where we're coming too close
You know, you don't want to stand there.
In fact, you're not even allowed to stand
where this gentleman is standing,
at the foaming, slippery waters at the threshold.
recognizing that our old paradigm
of just analyzing and pushing and predicting
parameters into the future,
aiming at minimalizing environmental impacts, is of the past.
which are the large environmental processes
that we have to be stewards of
to keep ourselves safe in the Holocene?
And could we even,
thanks to major advancements in Earth systems science,
the points where we may expect nonlinear change?
And could we even define
a planetary boundary, a fence,
within which we then have a safe operating space for humanity?
This work, which was published in "Nature,"
late 2009,
after a number of years of analysis,
led to the final proposition
that we can only find
nine planetary boundaries
with which, under active stewardship,
would allow ourselves to have a safe operating space.
But it shows that we are interconnected, among many systems on the planet,
with the three big systems, climate change,
stratospheric ozone depletion and ocean acidification
being the three big systems,
where the scientific evidence of large-scale thresholds
in the paleo-record of the history of the planet.
the systems that, under the hood,
regulate and buffer the capacity of the resilience of the planet --
the interference of the big nitrogen and phosphorus cycles on the planet,
biomass on the planet, carbon sequestration, diversity.
And then we have two parameters which we were not able to quantify --
Together, these form an integrated whole
In fact, most evidence indicates
that these nine may behave as three Musketeers,
"One for all. All for one."
You degrade forests, you go beyond the boundary on land,
you undermine the ability of the climate system
The drama here is, in fact, that
it may show that the climate challenge
as suggested by this analysis.
The yellow dot in the middle here is our starting point,
the pre-industrial point,
where we're very safely in the safe operating space.
In the '60s already, through the green revolution
and the Haber-Bosch process
of fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere --
you know, human's today take out more nitrogen from the atmosphere

which is the sixth extinction period in the history of humanity --
one of them being the extinctions of the dinosaurs --
nitrogen and climate change.
But we still have some degrees of freedom on the others,
but we are approaching fast
on land, water, phosphorus and oceans.
But this gives a new paradigm
to guide humanity,
which operates as if
we're only on a dark, straight highway.
how gloomy is this?
Is then sustainable development utopia?
Well, there's no science to suggest.
In fact, there is ample science
to indicate that we can do this transformative change,
that we have the ability
to now move into a new innovative,
a transformative gear,
across scales.
have to simultaneously start moving
from the current linear,
command and control thinking,
looking at efficiencies and optimization
towards a much more flexible,
a much more adaptive approach,
both in social and environmental systems,
in the ability of social systems and ecological systems
to withstand shocks and still remain in that desired cup.
and the ability to rise after a crisis,
and of course to adapt to unavoidable change.
This is a new paradigm.
We're not doing that at any scale on governance.

with lower and lower yields, degrading the organic matter
and fundamental problems at the livelihood levels

But again, a crisis, new partnerships,

But even on the hard policy area we have innovations.

You solve the climate issue with regards to the energy sector,
while at the same time, stimulating innovation --
is the shift in mindset,
moving away from a situation where we simply are pushing ourselves
into a dark future,
where we instead backcast our future,
and we say, "What is the playing field on the planet?
What are the planetary boundaries
within which we can safely operate?"
and then backtrack innovations within that.
But of course, the drama is, it clearly shows
that incremental change is not an option.
than what we did when we moved into
the situation we're in today.
Now, science indicates that,
if we move simultaneously,
collaborating on a global level, from local to global scale,
Martin Luther King
did not say,
"I have a nightmare,"
when he inspired the civil rights movements.
He said, "I have a dream."
And I have a dream.
I have a dream that we can stop thinking
that the future will be a nightmare,
and this is going to be a challenge,
because, if you think
of every major blockbusting film of recent times,
nearly all of its visions for humanity
are apocalyptic.
I think this film
is one of the hardest watches of modern times, "The Road."
It's a beautiful piece of filmmaking,
but everything is desolate,
everything is dead.
And just a father and son
trying to survive, walking along the road.
And I think the environmental movement
of which I am a part of
has been complicit
in creating this vision of the future.
we have peddled a nightmarish vision
of what's going to happen.
We have focused on the worst-case scenario.
We have focused on the problems.
And we have not thought enough
about the solutions.
We've used fear, if you like,
to grab people's attention.
And any psychologist will tell you
that fear in the organism
is linked to flight mechanism.
It's part of the fight and flight mechanism,
that when an animal is frightened --
think of a deer.
A deer freezes very, very still,
poised to run away.
And I think that's what we're doing
when we're asking people to engage with our agenda
around environmental degradation and climate change.
People are freezing and running away
because we're using fear.
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up
and start to think about
what progress is.
And one of the problems that we face, I think,
is that the only people that have cornered the market
in terms of progress
is a financial definition of what progress is,
an economic definition of what progress is --
that somehow,
if we get the right numbers to go up,
we're going to be better off,
whether that's on the stock market,
whether that's with GDP
and economic growth,
that somehow life is going to get better.
This is somehow appealing to human greed
instead of fear --
that more is better.
Come on. In the Western world, we have enough.
Maybe some parts of the world don't, but we have enough.
And we've know for a long time that this is not a good measure
of the welfare of nations.
In fact, the architect of our national accounting system,
Simon Kuznets, in the 1930s,
said that, "A nation's welfare
can scarcely be inferred from their national income."
But we've created a national accounting system
which is firmly based on production
and producing stuff.
And indeed, this is probably historical, and it had its time.
In the second World War, we needed to produce a lot of stuff.
And indeed, we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff
that we destroyed a lot of Europe, and we had to rebuild it afterwards.
And so our national accounting system
became fixated on what we can produce.
this visionary man, Robert Kennedy,
at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign,
gave the most eloquent deconstruction
of gross national product
that ever has been.
And he finished his talk with the phrase,
that, "The gross national product
measures everything except that
which makes life worthwhile."
How crazy is that? That our measure of progress,
our dominant measure of progress in society,
is measuring everything
except that which makes life worthwhile?
I believe, if Kennedy was alive today,
he would be asking statisticians such as myself
to go out and find out
what makes life worthwhile.
He'd be asking us to redesign
our national accounting system
to be based upon
such important things as social justice,
sustainability
and people's well-being.
and asked these questions around the world.
This is from a global survey.
It's asking people, what do they want.
And unsurprisingly, people all around the world
say that what they want
is happiness, for themselves,
for their families, their children,
their communities.
Okay, they think money is slightly important.
It's there, but it's not nearly as important as happiness,
and it's not nearly as important as love.
We all need to love and be loved in life.
It's not nearly as important as health.
We want to be healthy and live a full life.
These seem to be natural human aspirations.
Why are statisticians not measuring these?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms,
instead of just how much stuff we have?
And really, this is what I've done with my adult life --
is think about how do we measure happiness,
how do we measure well-being,
how can we do that within environmental limits.
the New Economics Foundation,
something we call the Happy Planet Index,
because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy.
Why don't we create a measure of progress that shows that?
And what we do,
is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation
is how successful is it
at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens.
That should be the goal
of every nation on the planet.
But we have to remember
that there's a fundamental input to that,
and that is how many of the planet's resources we use.
We all have one planet. We all have to share it.
It is the ultimate scarce resource,
the one planet that we share.
And economics is very interested in scarcity.
When it has a scarce resource
that it wants to turn into
a desirable outcome,
it thinks in terms of efficiency.
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck.
And this is a measure of how much well-being
we get for our planetary resource use.
It is an efficiency measure.
And probably the easiest way to show you that,
is to show you this graph.
is "ecological footprint,"
which is a measure of how much resources we use
and how much pressure we put on the planet.
More is bad.
Running vertically upwards,
is a measure called "happy life years."
It's about the well-being of nations.
It's like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy.
It's like quality and quantity of life in nations.
And the yellow dot there you see, is the global average.
Now, there's a huge array of nations
around that global average.
To the top right of the graph,
are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being,
but they're using a lot of planet to get there.
They are the U.S.A.,
other Western countries going across in those triangles
and a few Gulf states in there actually.
Conversely, at the bottom left of the graph,
are countries that are not producing much well-being --
typically, sub-Saharan Africa.
In Hobbesian terms,
life is short and brutish there.
The average life expectancy in many of these countries
is only 40 years.
Malaria, HIV/AIDS
are killing a lot of people
in these regions of the world.
There are some countries up there, yellow triangles,
that are doing better than global average,
that are heading up towards the top left of the graph.
This is an aspirational graph.
We want to be top left, where good lives don't cost the earth.
They're Latin American.
The country on its own up at the top
is a place I haven't been to.
Maybe some of you have.
Costa Rica.
Costa Rica --
average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years.
That is longer than in the USA.
They are, according to the latest Gallup world poll,
the happiest nation on the planet --
than anybody; more than Switzerland and Denmark.
They are the happiest place.
They are doing that
on a quarter of the resources
that are used typically in [the] Western world --
a quarter of the resources.
What's happening in Costa Rica?
We can look at some of the data.
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources.
Their government is one of the first to commit
to be carbon neutral by 2021.
They abolished the army
in 1949 --
1949.
And they invested in social programs --
health and education.
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America
and in the world.
And they have that Latin vibe, don't they.
They have the social connectedness.
(Laughter)
The challenge is, that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about --
is that the future
might not be North American,
might not be Western European.
It might be Latin American.
And the challenge, really,
is to pull the global average up here.
That's what we need to do.
And if we're going to do that,
we need to pull countries from the bottom,
and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph.
And then we're starting to create a happy planet.
That's one way of looking at it.
We don't have good data going back for every country in the world,
but for some of the richest countries, the OECD group, we do.
And this is the trend in well-being over that time,
a small increase,
but this is the trend in ecological footprint.
And so in strict happy-planet methodology,
we've become less efficient
at turning our ultimate scarce resource
into the outcome we want to.
And the point really is, is that I think,
probably everybody in this room
would like society to get to 2050
without an apocalyptic
something happening.
It's actually not very long away.
It's half a human lifetime away.
A child entering school today
will be my age in 2050.
This is not the very distant future.
This is what the U.K. government target
on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like.
And I put it to you, that is not business as usual.
That is changing our business.
That is changing the way we create our organizations,
we do our government policy and we live our lives.
And the point is,
we need to carry on increasing well-being.
No one can go to the polls
and say that quality of life is going to reduce.
None of us, I think,
want human progress to stop.
I think we want it to carry on.
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing.
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in.
I think this is what they want. They want quality of life to keep increasing.
They want to hold on to what they've got.
And if we're going to engage them,
I think that's what we've got to do.
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more.
but the point is we need to turn those curves.
And this is where I think we can take a leaf
out of systems theory, systems engineers,
where they create feedback loops,
put the right information at the right point of time.
Human beings are very motivated by the "now."
You put a smart meter in your home,
and you see how much electricity you're using right now,
how much it's costing you,
your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly.
What would that look like for society?
Why is it, on the radio news every evening,
I hear the FTSE 100, the Dow Jones, the dollar pound ratio --
I don't even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news.
And why do I hear that?
Why don't I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday,
or American used yesterday?
Did we meet our three percent annual target
on reducing carbon emissions?
That's how you create a collective goal.
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it.
And we need positive feedback loops
for increasing well-being
At a government level, they might create national accounts of well-being.
At a business level, you might look at the well-being of your employees,
which we know is really linked to creativity,
which is linked to innovation,
and we're going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues.
At a personal level, we need these nudges too.
Maybe we don't quite need the data, but we need reminders.
In the U.K., we have a strong public health message
on five fruit and vegetables a day
and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing.
What are these for happiness?
What are the five things that you should do every day
to be happier?
a big program called the Foresight program --
lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts --
everything evidence based -- a huge tome.
But a piece of work we did was on: what five positive actions can you do
to improve well-being in your life?
And the point of these is
they are, not quite, the secrets of happiness,
but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from.
is that your social relationships
are the most important cornerstones of your life.
Do you invest the time with your loved ones
that you could do, and energy?
Keep building them.
The second one is be active.
The fastest way out of a bad mood:
step outside, go for a walk, turn the radio on and dance.
Being active is great for our positive mood.
The third one is take notice.
How aware are you of things going on around the world,
the seasons changing, people around you?
Do you notice what's bubbling up for you and trying to emerge?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness,
cognitive behavioral therapy,
[very] strong for our well being.
The fourth is keep learning
and keep is important --
learning throughout the whole life course.
Older people who keep learning and are curious,
they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down.
But it doesn't have to be formal learning; it's not knowledge based.
It's more curiosity.
It can be learning to cook a new dish,
picking up an instrument you forgot as a child.
Keep learning.
And the final one
is that most anti-economic of activities,
but give.
Our generosity, our altruism,
our compassion,
are all hardwired
to the reward mechanism in our brain.
We feel good if we give.
You can do an experiment where you give
two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning.
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves
and one on other people.
You measure their happiness at the end of the day,
those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier
that those that spent it on themselves.
which we put onto these handy postcards,
I would say, don't have to cost the earth.
They don't have any carbon content.
They don't need a lot of material goods to be satisfied.
And so I think it's really quite feasible
that happiness does not cost the earth.
Now, Martin Luther King,
on the eve of his death,
gave an incredible speech.
He said, "I know there are challenges ahead,
there may be trouble ahead,
but I fear no one. I don't care.
I have been to the mountain top,
and I have seen the Promised Land."
Now, he was a preacher,
but I believe the environmental movement
and, in fact, the business community, government,
needs to go to the top of the mountain top,
and it needs to look out,
and it needs to see the Promised Land,
or the land of promise,
and it needs to have a vision
of a world that we all want.
And not only that, we need to create a Great Transition
to get there,
and we need to pave that great transition with good things.
Pave them with the five ways.
And we need to have signposts
gathering people together and pointing them --
something like the Happy Planet Index.
And then I believe
that we can all create a world we all want,
where happiness does not cost the earth.
So I work in marketing, which I love,
but my first passion was physics,
a passion brought to me by a wonderful school teacher,
when I had a little less gray hair.
So he taught me
that physics is cool
because it teaches us so much about the world around us.
And I'm going to spend the next few minutes trying to convince you
that physics can teach us something about marketing.
who studied some marketing in university?
Who studied some physics in university?
Pretty good. And at school?
Okay, lots of you.
So, hopefully this will bring back some happy,
or possibly some slightly disturbing memories.
We'll start with something very simple -- Newton's Law:
"The force equals mass times acceleration."
This is something that perhaps Turkish Airlines
should have studied a bit more carefully
before they ran this campaign.
(Laughter)
But if we rearrange this formula quickly,
we can get to acceleration equals force over mass,
which means
that for a larger particle -- a larger mass --
it requires more force to change its direction.
It's the same with brands:
the more massive a brand, the more baggage it has,
the more force is needed to change its positioning.
And that's one of the reasons why
Arthur Andersen chose to launch Accenture
rather than try to persuade the world
that Andersen's could stand for something
other than accountancy.
It explains why Hoover
found it very difficult to persuade the world
that it was more than vacuum cleaners,
and why companies like Unilever and P&G
keep brands separate,
like Ariel and Pringles and Dove
rather than having one giant parent brand.
So the physics is that the bigger the mass of an object
the more force is needed
to change its direction.
The marketing is, the bigger a brand,
the more difficult it is to reposition it.
So think about a portfolio of brands
or maybe new brands for new ventures.
Getting a little more technical now.
So this says that
it's impossible, by definition,
to measure exactly the state -- i.e., the position --
and the momentum of a particle,
because the act of measuring it, by definition, changes it.
So to explain that -- if you've got an elementary particle
and you shine a light on it,
then the photon of light has momentum,
which knocks the particle,
so you don't know where it was before you looked at it.
By measuring it,
the act of measurement changes it.
The act of observation changes it.
It's the same in marketing.
So with the act of observing consumers, changes their behavior.
Think about the group of moms
who are talking about their wonderful children in a focus group,
and almost none of them buy lots of junk food.
And yet, McDonald's sells hundreds of millions of burgers every year.
Think about the people who are on accompanied shops in supermarkets,
who stuff their trolleys
full of fresh green vegetables and fruit,
but don't shop like that any other day.
And if you think about the number of people
who claim in surveys
to regularly look for porn on the Web,
it's very few.
Yet, at Google, we know it's the number-one searched for category.
So luckily, the science --
no, sorry -- the marketing is getting easier.
Luckily, with now better point-of-sale tracking,
more digital media consumption,
you can measure more what consumers actually do,
rather than what they say they do.
So the physics is
you can never accurately and exactly
measure a particle,
because the observation changes it.
The marketing is -- the message for marketing is --
that try to measure what consumers actually do,
rather than what they say they'll do
or anticipate they'll do.
an axiom of physics, of all science --
says you cannot prove a hypothesis through observation,
you can only disprove it.
What this means is you can gather more and more data
around a hypothesis or a positioning,
and it will strengthen it, but it will not conclusively prove it.
And only one contrary data point
can blow your theory out of the water.
So if we take an example --
Ptolemy had dozens of data points to support his theory
that the planets would rotate around the Earth.
It only took one robust observation from Copernicus
to blow that idea out of the water.
And there are parallels for marketing --
you can invest for a long time in a brand,
but a single contrary observation of that positioning
will destroy consumers' belief.
Take BP --
they spent millions of pounds over many years
building up its credentials as an environmentally friendly brand,
but then one little accident.
Think about Toyota.
It was, for a long time, revered
as the most reliable of cars,
and then they had the big recall incident.
And Tiger Woods, for a long time,
the perfect brand ambassador.
Well, you know the story.
(Laughter)
So the physics is
that you cannot prove a hypothesis,
but it's easy to disprove it --
any hypothesis is shaky.
And the marketing is
that not matter how much you've invested in your brand,
one bad week can undermine decades of good work.
So be really careful to try and avoid the screw-ups
that can undermine your brand.
the second law of thermodynamics.
This says that entropy,
which is a measure of the disorder of a system,
will always increase.
The same is true of marketing.
If we go back 20 years,
the one message pretty much controlled by one marketing manager
could pretty much define a brand.
But where we are today, things have changed.
You can get a strong brand image
or a message
and put it out there like the Conservative Party did
earlier this year with their election poster.
But then you lose control of it.
With the kind of digital comment creation and distribution tools
that are available now to every consumer,
it's impossible to control where it goes.
Your brand starts being dispersed,
(Laughter)
it gets more chaotic.
(Laughter)
It's out of your control.
(Laughter)
I actually saw him speak -- he did a good job.
But while this may be unsettling for marketers,
it's actually a good thing.
This distribution of brand energy
gets your brand closer to the people,
more in with the people.
It makes this distribution of energy a democratizing force,
which is ultimately good for your brand.
So, the lesson from physics is
that entropy will always increase; it's a fundamental law.
The message for marketing is that your brand is more dispersed.
You can't fight it, so embrace it
and find a way to work with it.
my teacher, Mr. Vutter, told me
that physics is cool,
and hopefully, I've convinced you
that physics can teach all of us, even in the world of marketing, something special.
Thank you.
Come with me to the bottom of the world,
Antarctica,
the highest, driest, windiest,
and yes, coldest region on Earth --
more arid than the Sahara
and, in parts, colder than Mars.
The ice of Antarctica glows
with a light so dazzling,
it blinds the unprotected eye.
Early explorers rubbed cocaine in their eyes
to kill the pain of it.
The weight of the ice is such that the entire continent
sags below sea level, beneath its weight.
Yet, the ice of Antarctica
is a calendar of climate change.
It records the annual rise and fall
of greenhouse gases and temperatures
going back before the onset of the last ice ages.
Nowhere on Earth
offers us such a perfect record.
And here, scientists are drilling
into the past of our planet
to find clues to the future
of climate change.
I traveled to a place called WAIS Divide,
about 600 miles from the South Pole.
It is the best place on the planet, many say,
to study the history of climate change.
There, about 45 scientists from the University of Wisconsin,
the Desert Research Institute in Nevada and others
have been working to answer a central question
about global warming.
What is the exact relationship
between levels of greenhouse gases
and planetary temperatures?
It's urgent work. We know that temperatures are rising.
This past May was the warmest worldwide on record.
And we know that levels of greenhouse gases are rising too.
What we don't know
is the exact, precise, immediate
impact of these changes
on natural climate patterns --
winds, ocean currents,
precipitation rates, cloud formation,
things that bear on the health and well-being
of billions of people.
was ferried 885 miles
from McMurdo Station,
the main U.S. supply base
on the coast of Antarctica.
WAIS Divide itself though,
is a circle of tents in the snow.
In blizzard winds, the crew sling ropes between the tents
so that people can feel their way safely
to the nearest ice house
and to the nearest outhouse.
It snows so heavily there,
the installation was almost immediately buried.
Indeed, the researchers picked this site
because ice and snow accumulates here
10 times faster than anywhere else in Antarctica.
They have to dig themselves out every day.
It makes for an exotic
and chilly commute.
is a hive of industrial activity
centered around an eight-million-dollar drill assembly.
Periodically, this drill, like a biopsy needle,
plunges thousands of feet deep into the ice
to extract a marrow of gases
and isotopes for analysis.
Ten times a day, they extract
the 10-foot long cylinder of compressed ice crystals
that contain the unsullied air and trace chemicals
laid down by snow,
season after season for thousands of years.
It's really a time machine.
At the peak of activity earlier this year,
the researchers lowered the drill
an extra hundred feet deeper into the ice every day
and another 365 years
deeper into the past.
Periodically, they remove
a cylinder of ice,
like gamekeepers popping a spent shotgun shell
from the barrel of a drill.
They inspect it, they check it for cracks,
for drill damage, for spalls, for chips.
they prepare it for inspection and analysis
by 27 independent laboratories
in the United States and Europe,
who will examine it for 40 different trace chemicals
related to climate,
some in parts per quadrillion.
Yes, I said that with a Q, quadrillion.
They cut the cylinders up into three-foot sections
for easier handling and shipment
back to these labs,
some 8,000 miles from the drill site.
Each cylinder
is a parfait of time.
15,800 years ago,
when our ancestors were daubing themselves with paint
and considering the radical new technology
of the alphabet.
Bathed in polarized light
and cut in cross-section,
this ancient ice reveals itself
as a mosaic of colors,
each one showing how conditions at depth in the ice
have affected this material
at depths where pressures can reach
a ton per square inch.
Every year, it begins with a snowflake,
and by digging into fresh snow,
we can see how this process is ongoing today.
This wall of undisturbed snow,
back-lit by sunlight,
shows the striations of winter and summer snow,
layer upon layer.
Each storm scours the atmosphere,
washing out dust, soot,
trace chemicals,
and depositing them on the snow pack
year after year,
millennia after millennia,
creating a kind of periodic table of elements
that at this point
is more than 11,000 feet thick.
From this, we can detect an extraordinary number of things.
We can see the calcium
from the world's deserts,
soot from distant wildfires,
methane as an indicator of the strength of a Pacific monsoon,
all wafted on winds from warmer latitudes
to this remote and very cold place.
these cylinders and this snow
trap air.
Each cylinder is about 10 percent ancient air,
a pristine time capsule
of greenhouse gases -- carbon dioxide,
methane, nitrous oxide --
all unchanged from the day that snow formed
and first fell.
And this is the object of their scrutiny.
But don't we already know
what we need to know about greenhouse gases?
Why do we need to study this anymore?
Don't we already know how they affect temperatures?
Don't we already know the consequences
of a changing climate on our settled civilization?
The truth is, we only know the outlines,
and what we don't completely understand,
we can't properly fix.
Indeed, we run the risk of making things worse.
international environmental effort of the 20th century,
the Montreal Protocol,
in which the nations of Earth banded together to protect the planet
from the harmful effects of ozone-destroying chemicals
used at that time
in air conditioners, refrigerators and other cooling devices.
We banned those chemicals,
and we replaced them, unknowingly,
with other substances
that, molecule per molecule,
are a hundred times more potent
as heat-trapping, greenhouse gases
than carbon dioxide.
extraordinary precautions.
The scientists must insure
that the ice is not contaminated.
Moreover, in this 8,000-mile journey,
they have to insure this ice doesn't melt.
Imagine juggling a snowball across the tropics.
They have to, in fact,
make sure this ice never gets warmer
than about 20 degrees below zero,
otherwise, the key gases inside it will dissipate.
So, in the coldest place on Earth,
they work inside a refrigerator.
As they handle the ice, in fact,
they keep an extra pair of gloves warming in an oven,
so that, when their work gloves freeze
and their fingers stiffen,
they can don a fresh pair.
They work against the clock and against the thermometer.
about 4,500 feet of ice cores
for shipment back to the United States.
This past season,
they manhandled them across the ice
to waiting aircraft.
The 109th Air National Guard
flew the most recent shipment of ice
back to the coast of Antarctica,
where it was boarded onto a freighter,
shipped across the tropics to California,
unloaded, put on a truck,
driven across the desert
to the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colorado,
where, as we speak,
scientists are now slicing this material up
for samples, for analysis,
to be distributed
to the laboratories around the country
and in Europe.
last empty quarter --
the blind spot
in our expanding vision of the world.
Early explorers
sailed off the edge of the map,
and they found a place
where the normal rules of time and temperature
seem suspended.
Here, the ice seems a living presence.
The wind that rubs against it
gives it voice.
It is a voice of experience.
It is a voice we should heed.
So I'm going to talk to you about you about the political chemistry of oil spills
and why this is an incredibly important,
long, oily, hot summer,
and why we need to keep ourselves from getting distracted.
But before I talk about the political chemistry,
I actually need to talk about the chemistry of oil.
Prudhoe Bay in Alaska in 2002
to watch the Minerals Management Service
testing their ability
to burn oil spills in ice.
And what you see here is, you see a little bit of crude oil,
you see some ice cubes,
and you see two sandwich baggies of napalm.
The napalm is burning there quite nicely.
And the thing is, is that
oil is really an abstraction for us as the American consumer.
We're four percent of the world's population;
we use 25 percent of the world's oil production.
And we don't really understand what oil is,
until you check out its molecules,
And you don't really understand that until you see this stuff burn.
So this is what happens as that burn gets going.
It takes off. It's a big woosh.
I highly recommend that you get a chance to see crude oil burn someday,
because you will never need to hear another poli sci lecture
on the geopolitics of oil again.
It'll just bake your retinas.
So there it is; the retinas are baking.
Oil is a stew of hydrocarbon molecules.
It starts of with the very small ones,
which are one carbon, four hydrogen --
that's methane -- it just floats off.
Then there's all sorts of intermediate ones with middle amounts of carbon.
You've probably heard of benzene rings; they're very carcinogenic.
And it goes all the way over
to these big, thick, galumphy ones that have hundreds of carbons,
and they have thousands of hydrogens,
and they have vanadium and heavy metals and sulfur
and all kinds of craziness hanging off the sides of them.
Those are called the asphaltenes; they're an ingredient in asphalt.
They're very important in oil spills.
the chemistry of oil in water.
It is this chemistry that makes oil so disastrous.
Oil doesn't sink, it floats.
If it sank, it would be a whole different story as far as an oil spill.
And the other thing it does is it spreads out the moment it hits the water.
It spreads out to be really thin,
so you have a hard time corralling it.
The next thing that happens
is the light ends evaporate,
and some of the toxic things float into the water column
and kill fish eggs
and smaller fish and things like that, and shrimp.
And then the asphaltenes -- and this is the crucial thing --
the asphaltenes get whipped by the waves
into a frothy emulsion, something like mayonnaise.
It triples the amount
of oily, messy goo that you have in the water,
and it makes it very hard to handle.
It also makes it very viscous.
When the Prestige sank off the coast of Spain,
there were big, floating cushions the size of sofa cushions
of emulsified oil,
with the consistency, or the viscosity, of chewing gum.
It's incredibly hard to clean up.
And every single oil is different when it hits water.
also hits our politics,
it's absolutely explosive.
For the first time, American consumers
will kind of see the oil supply chain in front of themselves.
They have a "eureka!" moment,
when we suddenly understand oil in a different context.
So I'm going to talk just a little bit about the origin of these politics,
because it's really crucial to understanding
why this summer is so important, why we need to stay focused.
Nobody gets up in the morning and thinks,
"Wow! I'm going to go buy
some three-carbon-to-12-carbon molecules to put in my tank
and drive happily to work."
No, they think, "Ugh. I have to go buy gas.
I'm so angry about it. The oil companies are ripping me off.
They set the prices, and I don't even know.
I am helpless over this."
And this is what happens to us at the gas pump --
and actually, gas pumps are specifically designed
to diffuse that anger.
You might notice that many gas pumps, including this one,
are designed to look like ATMs.
I've talked to engineers. That's specifically to diffuse our anger,
because supposedly we feel good about ATMs.
(Laughter)
That shows you how bad it is.
comes in because most Americans actually feel
that oil prices are the result of a conspiracy,
not of the vicissitudes of the world oil market.
And the thing is, too,
is that we also feel very helpless about the amount that we consume,
which is somewhat reasonable,
because in fact, we have designed this system
where, if you want to get a job,
it's much more important to have a car that runs,
to have a job and keep a job, than to have a GED.
And that's actually very perverse.
which is that we'd rather be doing anything else.
This is BP's gas station
in downtown Los Angeles.
It is green. It is a shrine to greenishness.
"Now," you think, "why would something so lame
work on people so smart?"
Well, the reason is, is because, when we're buying gas,
we're very invested in this sort of cognitive dissonance.
I mean, we're angry at the one hand and we want to be somewhere else.
We don't want to be buying oil;
we want to be doing something green.
And we get kind of in on our own con.
I mean -- and this is funny,
it looks funny here.
But in fact, that's why the slogan "beyond petroleum" worked.
But it's an inherent part of our energy policy,
which is we don't talk about
reducing the amount of oil that we use.
We talk about energy independence. We talk about hydrogen cars.
We talk about biofuels that haven't been invented yet.
And so, cognitive dissonance
is part and parcel of the way that we deal with oil,
and it's really important to dealing with this oil spill.
are very moral in the United States.
The oil industry is like a huge, gigantic octopus
of engineering and finance
and everything else,
but we actually see it in very moral terms.
This is an early-on photograph -- you can see, we had these gushers.
Early journalists looked at these spills,
and they said, "This is a filthy industry."
But they also saw in it
that people were getting rich for doing nothing.
They weren't farmers, they were just getting rich for stuff coming out of the ground.
It's the "Beverly Hillbillies," basically.
But in the beginning, this was seen as a very morally problematic thing,
long before it became funny.
And the thing about John D. is that
he went into this chaotic wild-east
of oil industry,
and he rationalized it
into a vertically integrated company, a multinational.
It was terrifying; you think Walmart is a terrifying business model now,
imagine what this looked like in the 1860s or 1870s.
And it also the kind of root
of how we see oil as a conspiracy.
But what's really amazing is that
Ida Tarbell, the journalist,
went in and did a big exposé of Rockefeller
and actually got the whole antitrust laws
put in place.
But in many ways,
that image of the conspiracy still sticks with us.
And here's one of the things
that Ida Tarbell said --
she said, "He has a thin nose like a thorn.
There were no lips.
There were puffs under the little colorless eyes
with creases running from them."
(Laughter)
Okay, so that guy is actually still with us.
(Laughter)
I mean, this is a very pervasive -- this is part of our DNA.
And then there's this guy, okay.
every time we have high oil prices or an oil spill,
we call these CEOs down to Washington,
and we sort of pepper them with questions in public and we try to shame them.
And this is something that we've been doing since 1974,
when we first asked them, "Why are there these obscene profits?"
And we've sort of personalized the whole oil industry
into these CEOs.
And we take it as, you know --
we look at it on a moral level,
rather than looking at it on a legal and financial level.
And so I'm not saying these guys aren't liable to answer questions --
I'm just saying that, when you focus on
whether they are or are not a bunch of greedy bastards,
you don't actually get around to the point
of making laws that are either going to either change the way they operate,
or you're going to get around
to really reducing the amount of oil
and reducing our dependence on oil.
So I'm saying this is kind of a distraction.
But it makes for good theater,
and it's powerfully cathartic as you probably saw last week.
is that they are very politically galvanizing.
I mean, these pictures -- this is from the Santa Barbara spill.
You have these pictures of birds.
They really influence people.
When the Santa Barbara spill happened in 1969,
it formed the environmental movement in its modern form.
It started Earth Day.
It also put in place the National Environmental Policy Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act.
Everything that we are really stemmed from this period.
I think it's important to kind of look at these pictures of the birds
and understand what happens to us.
Here we are normally;
we're standing at the gas pump, and we're feeling kind of helpless.
We look at these pictures
and we understand, for the first time, our role in this supply chain.
We connect the dots in the supply chain.
And we have this kind of --
as voters, we have kind of a "eureka!" moment.
This is why these moments of these oil spills
are so important.
But it's also really important that we don't get distracted
by the theater or the morals of it.
We actually need to go in
and work on the roots of the problem.
was that we really worked on some of the symptoms.
We were very reactive, as opposed to being proactive
about what happened.
And so what we did was, actually,
we made moratoriums on the east and west coasts on drilling.
We stopped drilling in ANWR,
but we didn't actually reduce the amount of oil that we consumed.
In fact, it's continued to increase.
The only thing that really reduces the amount of oil that we consume
is much higher prices.
As you can see, our own production has fallen off
as our reservoirs have gotten old and expensive to drill out.
We only have two percent of the world's oil reserves;
65 percent of them are in the Persian Gulf.
is that, since 1969,
the country of Nigeria, or the part of Nigeria that pumps oil,
which is the delta -- which is two times the size of Maryland --
has had thousands of oil spills a year.
I mean, we've essentially been exporting oil spills
when we import oil from places
without tight environmental regulations.
That has been the equivalent of an Exxon Valdez spill
every year since 1969.
And we can wrap our heads around the spills,
because that's what we see here,
but in fact, these guys actually live in a war zone.
There's a thousand battle-related deaths a year
in this area twice the size of Maryland,
and it's all related to the oil.
And these guys, I mean, if they were in the U.S.,
they might be actually here in this room.
They have degrees in political science, degrees in business --
they're entrepreneurs. They don't actually want to be doing what they're doing.
And it's sort of one of the other groups of people
who pay a price for us.
as we've continued to increase demand,
is that we kind of play a shell game with the costs.
One of the places we put in a big oil project
in Chad, with Exxon.
So the U.S. taxpayer paid for it;
the World Bank, Exxon paid for it.
We put it in. There was a tremendous banditry problem.
I was there in 2003.
We were driving along this dark, dark road,
and the guy in the green stepped out,
and I was just like, "Ahhh! This is it."
And then the guy in the Exxon uniform stepped out,
and we realized it was okay.
They have their own private sort of army around them at the oil fields.
But at the same time,
Chad has become much more unstable,
and we are not paying for that price at the pump.
We pay for it in our taxes on April 15th.
with the price of policing the Persian Gulf
and keeping the shipping lanes open.
This is 1988 --
we actually bombed two Iranian oil platforms that year.
That was the beginning of an escalating U.S. involvement there
that we do not pay for at the pump.
We pay for it on April 15th,
and we can't even calculate the cost of this involvement.
The other place that is sort of supporting our dependence on oil
and our increased consumption
is the Gulf of Mexico,
which was not part of the moratoriums.
Now what's happened in the Gulf of Mexico -- as you can see,
this is the Minerals Management diagram
of wells for gas and oil.
It's become this intense industrialized zone.
It doesn't have the same resonance for us
that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge has,
but it should, I mean, it's a bird sanctuary.
Also, every time you buy gasoline in the United States,
half of it is actually being refined along the coast,
because the Gulf actually has
about 50 percent of our refining capacity
and a lot of our marine terminals as well.
So the people of the Gulf have essentially been subsidizing the rest of us
through a less-clean environment.
Now on the one hand, the price at the pump is not really very high
when you consider the actual cost of the oil,
but on the other hand,
the fact that people have no other transit options
means that they pay a large amount of their income
into just getting back and forth to work,
generally in a fairly crummy car.
If you look at people who make $50,000 a year, they have two kids,
they might have three jobs or more,
and then they have to really commute.
They're actually spending more on their car and fuel
than they are on taxes or on health care.
And the same thing happens
at the 50th percentile, around 80,000.
Gasoline costs are a tremendous drain
on the American economy,
but they're also a drain on individual families
and it's kind of terrifying to think about what happens when prices get higher.
what do we have to do this time?
What are the laws? What do we have to do to keep ourselves focused?
One thing is -- we need to stay away from the theater.
We need to stay away from the moratoriums.
We need to focus really back again
on the molecules.
The moratoriums are fine, but we do need to focus
on the molecules on the oil.
One of the things that we also need to do,
is we need to try to not kind of fool ourselves
into thinking that you can have a green world,
before you reduce the amount of oil that we use.
We need to focus on reducing the oil.
of how petroleum gets used in the U.S. economy.
It comes in on the side -- the useful stuff is the dark gray,
and the un-useful stuff,
which is called the rejected energy -- the waste,
goes up to the top.
Now you can see that the waste far outweighs
the actually useful amount.
And one of the things that we need to do
is, not only fix the fuel efficiency of our vehicles
and make them much more efficient,
but we also need to fix the economy in general.
For example, we have an insurance system
where the person who drives 20,000 miles a year
pays the same insurance as somebody who drives 3,000.
We actually encourage people to drive more.
We have policies that reward sprawl -- we have all kinds of policies.
We need to have more mobility choices.
We need to make the gas price
better reflect the real cost of oil.
And we need to shift subsidies from the oil industry,
which is at least 10 billion dollars a year,
into something that allows middle-class people to find better ways to commute.
Whether that's getting a much more efficient car
and also kind of building markets
for new cars and new fuels down the road,
this is where we need to be.
We need to kind of rationalize this whole thing,
and you can find more about this policy.
It's called STRONG, which is "Secure Transportation
Reducing Oil Needs Gradually,"
and the idea is instead of being helpless, we need to be more strong.
They're up at NewAmerica.net.
What's important about these
is that we try to move
from feeling helpless at the pump,
to actually being active
and to really sort of thinking about who we are,
having kind of that special moment,
where we connect the dots actually at the pump.
are the third rail of American politics -- the no-fly zone.
I actually -- I agree that a dollar a gallon on oil
is probably too much,
but I think that if we started this year
with three cents a gallon on gasoline,
and upped it to six cents next year, nine cents the following year,
all the way up to 30 cents by 2020,
that we could actually significantly reduce our gasoline consumption,
and at the same time we would give people time to prepare,
time to respond,
and we would be raising money and raising consciousness at the same time.
Let me give you a little sense of how this would work.
The first thing that you have on the tax is --
you have a tax for a stronger America -- 33 cents.
So you're not helpless at the pump.
And the second thing that you have is a kind of warning sign,
very similar to what you would find
on a cigarette pack.
And what it says is, "The National Academy of Sciences
estimates that every gallon of gas you burn in your car
creates 29 cents in health care costs."
That's a lot.
And so this -- you can see that you're paying considerably less
than the health care costs on the tax.
And also, the hope is that
you start to be connected to the whole greater system.
And at the same time, you have a number that you can call
to get more information on commuting,
or a low-interest loan on a different kind of car,
or whatever it is you're going to need
to actually reduce your gasoline dependence.
With this whole sort of suite of policies,
we could actually reduce our gasoline consumption --
or our oil consumption --
by 20 percent by 2020.
So, three million barrels a day.
one of the things we really need to do, is we need to remember
we are people of the hydrocarbon.
We need to keep or minds on the molecules
and not get distracted by the theater,
not get distracted by the cognitive dissonance
of the green possibilities that are out there.
We need to kind of get down and do the gritty work
of reducing our dependence upon this fuel and these molecules.
And the good news is there might be an easy solution to that,
and that's using our eyes more.
and then designing that information so it makes more sense,
or it tells a story,
This is the $Billion Dollar o-Gram,
and this image arose
out of frustration I had
with the reporting of billion-dollar amounts in the press.
20 billion for this war.
and then scaled the boxes according to those amounts.
And the colors here represent the motivation behind the money.
So purple is "fighting,"
This is OPEC's revenue, this green box here --
780 billion a year.
And this little pixel in the corner -- three billion --
that's their climate change fund.
Americans, incredibly generous people --
over 300 billion a year, donated to charity every year,
compared with the amount of foreign aid
Then of course,
And it mushroomed slightly. Afghanistan and Iraq mushroomed now
to 3,000 billion.
How much of this diagram do you think might be taken up
And the recent financial crisis,
how much of this diagram might that figure take up?
What has that cost the world? Let's take a look at that.
Dooosh -- Which I think is the appropriate sound effect
So, by visualizing this information,
we turned it into a landscape
that you can explore with your eyes,
Let's take a look.
This is Mountains Out of Molehills,
a timeline of global media panic.
(Laughter)
is the intensity of certain fears
Bird flu.
SARS -- brownish here. Remember that one?
The millennium bug,
terrible disaster.
These little green peaks
And in summer, here, killer wasps.
over time in our media.
Let me highlight it for you.
If we look closer, we see those peaks occur
at the same month every year.
for video games.
Why April?
all pushing that fear into the agenda.
And there's another pattern here as well. Can you spot it?
You see where it starts? September 2001,
when we had something very real
"Data is the new oil."
Data is the kind of ubiquitous resource
that we can shape to provide new innovations and new insights,
and it's all around us, and it can be mined very easily.
It's not a particularly great metaphor in these times,
especially if you live around the Gulf of Mexico,
but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly,
Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium.
But it's a really fertile medium,
and it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations,
they feel like flowers blooming from this medium.
But if you look at it directly,
it's just a lot of numbers and disconnected facts.
What rises twice a year,
once in Easter
and then two weeks before Christmas,
has a mini peak every Monday,
and then flattens out over the summer?
I'll take answers.
(Audience: Chocolate.) David McCandless: Chocolate.
You might want to get some chocolate in.
Any other guesses?
(Audience: Shopping.) DM: Shopping.
Yeah, retail therapy might help.
(Audience: Sick leave.)
DM: Sick leave. Yeah, you'll definitely want to take some time off.
Shall we see?
for the phrase "break-up" and "broken-up"
and this is the pattern we found --
and then the lowest day of the year, of course: Christmas Day.
Who would do that?
interesting things can emerge.
I wonder if I could make my life beautiful.
And here's my visual C.V.
I'm not quite sure I've succeeded.
Pretty blocky, the colors aren't that great.
But I wanted to convey something to you.
I started as a programmer,
and then I worked as a writer for many years, about 20 years,
in print, online and then in advertising,
and only recently have I started designing.
I just kind of learned through doing.
And when I started designing,
I discovered an odd thing about myself.
I already knew how to design,
but it wasn't like I was amazingly brilliant at it,
but more like I was sensitive
It's almost like being exposed
to all this media over the years
had instilled a kind of dormant design literacy in me.
And I don't feel like I'm unique.
are being blasted by information design.
There's something almost quite magical about visual information.
It's effortless, it literally pours in.
pouring into your senses every second.
Your sense of sight is the fastest.
It has the same bandwidth as a computer network.
Then you have touch, which is about the speed of a USB key.
And then you have hearing and smell,
which has the throughput of a hard disk.
And then you have poor old taste,
which is like barely the throughput of a pocket calculator.
And that little square in the corner, a naught .7 percent,
that's the amount we're actually aware of.
So a lot of your vision --
the bulk of it is visual, and it's pouring in.
It's unconscious.
The eye is exquisitely sensitive
to patterns in variations in color, shape and pattern.
you start speaking two languages simultaneously,
each enhancing the other.
So, you have the eye, and then you drop in the concepts.
And that whole thing -- it's two languages
both working at the same time.
to alter our perspective or change our views.
Let me ask you a simple question
with a really simple answer:
Who has the biggest military budget?
It's got to be America, right?
So massive, in fact, that it can contain
and the U.K. budget deficit for reference.
So that might well chime
with your view that America
is a sort of warmongering military machine,
out to overpower the world
with its huge industrial-military complex.
But is it true that America has the biggest military budget?
So its military budget is bound to be enormous.
So, to be fair and to alter our perspective,
we have to bring in another data set,
That changes the picture considerably.
Other countries pop into view that you, perhaps, weren't considering,
and American drops into eighth.
Who has the most soldiers? It's got to be China.
Of course, 2.1 million.
Again, chiming with your view
that China has a militarized regime
ready to, you know, mobilize its enormous forces.
But of course, China has an enormous population.
So if we do the same,
we see a radically different picture.
China drops to 124th.
It actually has a tiny army
when you take other data into consideration.
So, absolute figures, like the military budget,
I'm a bit of a health nut.
I love taking supplements and being fit,
This kind of diagram is called a balloon race.
So the higher up the image,
the more evidence there is for each supplement.
the relationship between efficacy and popularity,
but you can also, if you grade the evidence,
do a "worth it" line.
So supplements above this line are worth investigating,
but only for the conditions listed below,
and then the supplements below the line
are perhaps not worth investigating.
the biomedical database,
and we compiled them and graded them all.
And it was incredibly frustrating for me
because I had a book of 250 visualizations to do for my book,
and I spent a month doing this,
and I only filled two pages.
But what it points to
is that visualizing information like this
you can do cool stuff like this.
and I can say, "Yeah, brilliant."
So it spawns itself.
And then I can say, "Well, just show me the stuff
that affects heart health."
So let's filter that out.
So heart is filtered out, so I can see if I'm curious about that.
So the data is now alive; this is a living image,
and I can update it in a second.
So it's cool.
It's kind of living.
and it can go beyond numbers.
I like to apply information visualization
to ideas and concepts.
This is a visualization
of the political spectrum,
an attempt for me to try
and understand how it works
and how the ideas percolate down
from government into society and culture,
it explores our worldviews
and it helps us -- it helps me anyway --
to see what others think,
to see where they're coming from.
to be better than the right side --
being a journalist, a Left-leaning person --
but I couldn't, because I would have created
a lopsided, biased diagram.
So, in order to really create a full image,
I had to honor the perspectives on the right-hand side
and at the same time, uncomfortably recognize
how many of those qualities were actually in me,
But not too uncomfortable,
because there's something unthreatening
about seeing a political perspective,
versus being told or forced to listen to one.
You're capable of holding conflicting viewpoints
joyously when you can see them.
It's even fun to engage with them
because it's visual.
So that's what's exciting to me,
I wanted to say
that it feels to me that design is about solving problems
and providing elegant solutions,
from the overload and the saturation
to the breakdown of trust and reliability
and runaway skepticism and lack of transparency,
or even just interestingness.
I mean, I find information just too interesting.
can give us a very quick solution to those kinds of problems.
Even when the information is terrible,
the visual can be quite beautiful.
Often we can get clarity
or the answer to a simple question very quickly,
like this one,
the recent Icelandic volcano.
Which was emitting the most CO2?
We look at the data and we see:
Yep, the volcano emitted 150,000 tons;
the grounded planes would have emitted
345,000 if they were in the sky.
So essentially, we had our first carbon-neutral volcano.
I'm a proud Princeton dropout.
where I actually grew up.
I'm also fairly determined to try and build
a game layer on top of the world.
This is sort of a new concept and it's really important,
because while the last decade was the decade of social,
the decade where the framework in which we connect with other people was built,
this next decade will be the decade where the game framework is built,
where the motivations we use to actually influence behavior
and the framework in which that is constructed,
is decided upon, and that's really important.
but that's not quite true,
because it's already under construction; it's already happening.
And it looks like this right now.
It looks like the Web did back in 1997, right?
It's not very good. It's cluttered.
It's filled with lots of different things that, in short, aren't that fun.
There are credit card schemes and airline mile programs,
coupon cards and all these loyalty schemes
that actually do use game dynamics and are building the game layer --
they just suck.
They're not very well-designed.
But luckily, as my favorite action hero, Bob the Builder, says,
"We can do better. We can build this better."
And the tools, the resources that we use to build a game layer,
are game dynamics themselves.
And so the crux of this presentation is going to go through
four really important game dynamics,
really interesting things, that, if you use consciously,
you can use to influence behavior,
both for good, for bad, for in-between.
Hopefully for good.
But this is the important stage in which that framework will get built,
and so we want to all be thinking about it consciously now.
Why is this important?
I'm making this claim
that there's a game layer on top of the world,
and it's very important that we build it properly.
The reason it's so important is that, in the last decade,
what we've seen has been building the social layer,
has been this framework for connections,
and construction on that layer is over, it's finished.
There's still a lot to explore,
still a lot of people trying to figure out social
and how we leverage this and how we use this,
but the framework itself is done,
and it's called Facebook.
And that's OK, right? A lot of people are very happy with Facebook.
I like it quite a lot.
They've created this thing called the Open Graph,
and they own all of our connections.
They own half a billion people.
So when you want to build on the social layer,
the framework has been decided; it is the Open Graph API.
And if you're happy with that, fantastic.
If you're not, too bad. There's nothing you can do.
I mean, we want to build frameworks in a way that makes it acceptable
and makes it productive down the road.
So, the social layer is all about these connections.
The game layer is all about influence.
It's not about adding a social fabric to the web
and connecting you to other people
everywhere you are and everywhere you go,
it's actually about using dynamics, using forces,
to influence the behavior of where you are, what you do there,
how you do it.
That's really, really powerful.
So it's incredibly critical that at this moment,
while it's just getting constructed,
while the frameworks like Facebook or Open Graph
are being created for the game-layer equivalent,
that we think about it very consciously,
and that we do it in a way that is open, available,
and can be leveraged for good.
because construction has just begun,
and the more consciously we can think about this,
the better we'll be able to use it for anything we want.
So like I said, the way you go through and build on the game layer
is not with glass and steel and cement.
And the resources we use are not this two-dimensional swath of land
that we have.
The resources are mindshare,
and the tools, the raw materials, are these game dynamics.
With that, a couple game dynamics to talk about.
Back at SCVNGR, we like to joke
that with seven game dynamics, you can get anyone to do anything.
Today, I'm going to show you four,
because I hope to have a competitive advantage at the end of this, still.
It's called the appointment dynamic.
It's a dynamic in which to succeed,
players have to do something at a predefined time,
generally at a predefined place.
And these dynamics are a little scary sometimes,
because you think, "Other people can be using forces
that will manipulate how I interact:
what I do, where I do it, when I do it."
This sort of "loss of free will" that occurs in games
can be frightening.
So with each dynamic, I'm going to give three examples:
one that shows how it's already being used in the real world,
so you can rationalize it a bit;
one that shows it in what we consider a conventional game --
I think everything is a game,
but this is more what you'd think of as a game played on a board
or on a computer screen;
and one of how it can be used for good,
so you can see that these forces can be very powerful.
is something called, "Happy Hour."
So I had just recently dropped out of Princeton
and actually ended up for the first time in a bar,
and I saw these happy hour things all over the place.
And this is simply an appointment dynamic: come here at a certain time,
get your drinks half off.
To win, all you have to do is show up at the right place at the right time.
This game dynamic is so powerful,
it doesn't just influence our behavior; it's influenced our entire culture.
That's a really scary thought,
that one game dynamic can change things so powerfully.
I'm sure you've all heard of Farmville by now.
If you haven't, I recommend playing it.
You won't do anything else for the rest of your day.
Farmville has more active users than Twitter.
It's incredibly powerful,
and it has this dynamic where you have to return at a certain time
to water your fake crops, or they wilt.
And this is so powerful that when they tweak their stats,
when they say your crops wilt
after eight hours, or after six hours, or after 24 hours,
it changes the life cycle of some 70 million people during the day.
They will return, like clockwork, at different times.
So if they wanted the world to end, if they wanted productivity to stop,
they could make it a 30-minute cycle,
and no one could do anything else, right?
But this could also be used for good.
This local company called Vitality
has created a product to help people take their medicine on time.
That's an appointment.
It's something that people don't do very well.
They have these GlowCaps which flash and email you
and do cool things to remind you to take your medicine.
This isn't a game yet, but really should be.
You should get points for doing it on time
and lose points for not doing it on time.
They should recognize they've built an appointment dynamic,
and leverage the games.
Then you can really achieve good in some interesting ways.
Influence and status.
This is one of the most famous game dynamics, used all over the place.
It's used in your wallets, right now.
We all want that credit card on the far left, because it's black.
And you see someone at CVS or --
not CVS -- like, Christian Dior --
"I want that because it means they're cooler than I am,
and I need that."
And this is used in games as well.
"Modern Warfare," one of the most successful selling games of all time.
I'm only a level four, but I desperately want to be a level 10,
because they've got that cool red badge,
and that means that I am somehow better than everyone else.
And that's very powerful to me.
Status is really good motivator.
and can be used more consciously there.
School -- and remember, I made it through one year,
so I think I'm qualified to talk on school --
is a game; it's just not a terribly well-designed game.
There are levels. There are C. There are B. There's A.
There are statuses. I mean, what is valedictorian, but a status?
If we called valedictorian a "White Knight Paladin level 20,"
I think people would probably work a lot harder.
and there has been lots of experimentation on how we do this properly.
But let's use it consciously.
Why have games you can lose? Why go from an A to an F or a B to a C?
That sucks. Why not level-up?
At Princeton, they've actually experimented with this,
with quizzes where you gain experience points,
and you level up from B to an A.
And it's very powerful.
It can be used in interesting ways.
where you have to make progress, move through different steps
in a very granular fashion.
This is used all over the place, including LinkedIn,
where I am an unwhole individual.
I am only 85 percent complete on LinkedIn,
and that bothers me.
And this is so deep-seated in our psyche
that when we're presented with a progress bar
and presented with easy, granular steps to take
to try and complete that progress bar, we will do it.
We will find a way to move that blue line
all the way to the right edge of the screen.
I mean, this is a Paladin level 10,
and that's a Paladin level 20.
And if you were going to fight Orcs on the fields of Mordor
against the Ra's Al Ghul,
you'd probably want to be the bigger one, right?
I would.
And so people work very hard to level-up.
"World of Warcraft" is one of the most successful games of all time.
The average player spends some six, six-and-a-half hours a day on it,
their most dedicated players -- it's like a full-time job, it's insane.
And they have these systems where you can level-up.
And that's a very powerful thing. Progression is powerful.
One of the things we work on at SCVNGR is:
How do you use games to drive traffic and business to local businesses,
to something that is very key to the economy?
And here, we have a game that people play.
They go places, do challenges, earn points.
And we've introduced a progression dynamic into it,
where, by going to the same place over and over, doing challenges,
engaging with the business,
you move a green bar from the left edge of the screen to the right,
and unlock rewards.
This is powerful enough that we can see it hooks people into these dynamics,
pulls them back to the same local businesses,
creates loyalty, creates engagement,
and is able to drive meaningful revenue and fun and engagement to businesses.
These progression dynamics are powerful and can be used in the real world.
is this concept of communal discovery,
a dynamic in which everyone has to work together to achieve something.
Communal discovery is powerful
because it leverages the network that is society
to solve problems.
This is used in some famous consumer web stories like Digg,
which I'm sure you've all heard of.
Digg is a communal dynamic
to try to find and source the best news, the most interesting stories.
And they made this into a game, initially.
They had a leader board where, if you recommended the best stories,
you would get points.
And that really motivated people to find the best stories.
But it became so powerful, there was actually a cabal,
a group of people, the top seven on the leader board,
who would work together to make sure they maintained that position,
recommending people's stories.
They ended up shutting down the leader board because, while it was effective,
it was so powerful that it stopped sourcing the best stories,
and started having people work to maintain leadership.
So we have to use this one carefully.
It's also used in things like McDonald's Monopoly,
where the game is not the Monopoly you're playing,
but the cottage industries that form to try and find Boardwalk.
There, they're just looking for a sticker that says "Boardwalk,"
but it can also be used to find real things.
This is the DARPA balloon challenge,
where they hid a couple balloons all across the United States and said,
"Use networks. Try and find these balloons fastest,
and the winner will get $40,000."
The winner was a group out of MIT,
where they created sort of a pyramid scheme, a network,
where the first person to recommend the location of a balloon got $2,000,
and anyone else to push that recommendation up also got a cut.
And in 12 hours, they were able to find all these balloons,
all across the country.
Really powerful dynamic.
so if I'm going to leave you with anything,
last decade was the decade of social.
This next decade is the decade of games.
We use game dynamics to build on it. We build with mindshare.
We can influence behavior.
It's very powerful. It's very exciting.
Let's all build it together, let's do it well and have fun playing.
This talk is about righting writing wrongs.
No, the sound's not faulty -- righting writing wrongs.
The Middle East is huge,
and with all our problems, one thing's for sure: we love to laugh.
I think humor is a great way to celebrate our differences.
We need to take our responsibilities seriously,
but not ourselves.
Don't get me wrong: it's not like we don't have comedy in the Middle East.
I grew up at a time when iconic actors
from Kuwait, Syria, Egypt
used laughter to unite the region,
just as football can.
(Laughter)
Now is the time for us to laugh at ourselves,
before others can laugh with us.
This is the story of the rise and rise of stand-up comedy in the Middle East --
a stand-up uprising, if you will.
I quickly realized
that comedy connects audiences.
Now, the best breeding ground for good comic writing
is the stand-up comedy circuit,
where they just happen to say that you kill when you do well
and you bomb when you do badly.
An unfortunate connection for us maybe,
but it reminds me
that we'd like to thank one man for, over the past decade,
working tirelessly
to support comedians all around the world,
specifically comedians
with a Middle Eastern background.
(Applause)
Like my good friends, Dean and Maysoon, at the bottom of the screen,
who, two years after 9/11,
started a festival to change the way
Middle Easterners are perceived in the world.
It's still going strong, with positive press to die for.
Also, three guys working for years in Los Angeles,
an Iranian, a Palestinian and an Egyptian,
created the aptly named Axis of Evil comedy act.
And wherever they went,
they killed.
I moved to Dubai as the head of original content
for a Western TV network.
My job was to connect the brand with a Middle Eastern audience.
Now, the American head of programming
wanted new local Arabic comedy.
In a thick Arabic accent, my brain went,
"Berfect."
(Laughter)
Now, I had friends in the U.S.
who had started a successful new tribe.
And I had every intention of taking this tribe
from being outliers in the Middle East
and pushing them over the tipping point
towards success.
Now, as with any new idea, it wasn't easy.
I had four phases to this plan.
First, we'd need to buy content from the West and air it.
Then I'd bring my friends, and we'd show local amateurs how it's done.
We would film that and air it,
and then I could work with the local amateurs and write new comedy.
and his reaction was, "Um, I don't get it."
So I retreated back to my cave
and continued to support and produce comedy
and let my friends use my couch
as a regional operations hub.
Now, fast forward two years, to early 2007.
The earth rotated, as did our management,
(Laughter)
and as if by divine intervention,
things came together
to help this revolution take shape.
Here's how the dots connected.
First, the Axis guys recorded a Comedy Central special
that aired in the States,
and it was getting great hits on YouTube.
Our new French CEO
believed in the power of positive PR ...
(Laughter)
and ideas du bon marche.
Let's just say "value for money."
I produced in Dubai a show for Ahmed Ahmed
to showcase his new Axis special to a packed room.
I invited our new CEO,
and as soon as he realized we had a room packed full of laughing infidels,
his reaction was very simple:
"Let's make this happen.
And one more thing: No, don't F it up."
So I quickly went to work
with a great team around me.
I happened to find
a funny guy to present it in Arabic,
who is originally Korean,
a perfect fit for the Axis of Evil.
This is all true.
I had to remind the guys to be culturally sensitive.
I used the three Bs of stand-up don'ts
as I call them in the Middle East:
blue content, keep it clean; beliefs, not religion;
and the third B, bolitics.
Stay away from bolitics in the Middle East.
Oh course, you might think, what's left
without bolitics, sex and religion, how can you make people laugh?
I'd say, watch any successful well-written,
family-friendly sitcom in the West
for your answers.
In five countries, in just under a month,
we had thousands of fanatical fans come and see them live.
We had millions see them on TV and on TV news.
In Jordan, we had His Majesty the King come and see them.
In fact, they were so successful
that you could buy a pirated copy of their DVD,
even before it was released in the Middle East.
Anywhere you go.
So everywhere we went,
we auditioned amateurs.
We filmed that process and aired a documentary.
I called it "Three Guys and Wonho."
It really is his name.
And all this TV and Internet exposure
has led to a great many
recruits to our cause.
In Dubai this year, we've just had
the first all-women's, homegrown stand-up show.
And notice two of them are wearing headscarves,
and yes, even they can laugh.
that supports anyone who wants to make things happen.
20 years ago,
no one had heard of it.
Look at it now.
With an inspirational leader, I think this year,
the opening of the tallest tower in the world
is like adding a finger to that hand,
that points at all those
who spread fallacious stories about us.
with stand-up comedy shows happening even in Saudi Arabia.
These comics are now going to the New York festival.
And the Lebanese, brilliant Lebanese,
Nemr Abou Nassar, we featured in our first tour,
has just been performing in L.A.'s legendary comedy clubs.
So clearly, from the inside, we are doing our best to change our image,
and it's exploding.
(Laughter)
So, as for the outsiders looking in,
watch the CNN report on the second Amman Comedy Festival.
The reporter did a great job, and I thank her,
but somebody forgot to send the positive PR email
to the person operating the automatic news ticker that appears at the bottom.
For example, when Dean talks,
the ticker says, "U.S.: Suspect gave 'actionable intel."
Well, if you're used to listening to comedians,
then I'm not surprised.
that represents how the media in the West
talks about us as bombers, billionaires
and belly dancers.
Enough.
We're not all angry fanatics
who want to kill the infidel.
We have a positive story to tell
and image to sell.
In fact, one thing's for sure, in my experience,
we love to laugh like hell.
to test the truthiness of our representation
in any media story.
One: Is the Middle East
being shown in a current time
and correct context?
(Laughter)
Two: Do the Middle Eastern characters
laugh or smile
without showing the whites of their eyes?
(Laughter)
Three: Is the Middle Eastern character
being played by one?
Clearly, there are wrongs that need to be righted.
We've started in our region.
My challenge to the rest of the world
is please, start using
positive Middle Eastern images in your stories.
For inspiration, go to one of our festivals,
go online, drop us a line.
Let's change the narrative together
and let's start righting writing wrongs.
with a quote from one of the greatest Sheikhs
to put quill to parchment.
As my father likes to call him, "Asheikh Azubare;"
as my mother would say, "Shakespeare."
(Laughter)
"And now we go in content
to liberty and not to banishment."
The other founding members included Ahmed Ahmed,
He went out solo and did it first.
Then there was Aron Kader, who was the Palestinian-American.
And then there was me, the Iranian-American of the group.
These are dilemmas I have every day.
which means I have the American passport,
Because if you only have the Iranian passport,
you know -- Syria, Venezuela, North Korea.
So I remember getting my American passport.
I was like, "Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel."
I've never had trouble in any Western countries with my American passport,
He said, "What is your father's name?"
I said, "Well, he's passed away, but his name was Khosro."
I should be able to play any part, good, bad, what have you.
But a lot of times in Hollywood,
Can you say 'I will kill you in the name of Allah?'"
They go, "Great! And then you hijack the hospital."
Don't get me wrong, I don't mind playing bad guys.
I want to play a bad guy. I want to rob a bank.
"Gimme all your money, or I'll blow myself up!"
Now I'll tell you, as a Middle-Eastern male,
when you show up around a lot of these activities,
you start feeling guilty at one point.
"We just want to say:
to get a chance to perform all over the world,
And it's great, there's good people everywhere.
And you learn great things about these places.
I was walking by. The guy goes, "Psst! Habibi, my friend."
He's like, "Good stuff, man. Colombian. Top of the line."
He goes, "I thought you were my driver."
"My name is Bond.
it was called Natal -- I was inspired,
and I thought for a moment,
maybe it's possible
to address that one problem of storytelling,
to create a character
which seemed alive,
which noticed me,
that could look me in the eyes
and feel real,
and sculpt a story about our relationship.
And so a year ago,
I showed this off
at a computer show called E3.
And this was a piece of technology
with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.
And there was a huge row online
about, "Hey, this can't be real."
And so I waited till now
to have an actual demo
of the real tech.
three big elements.
The first is a Kinect camera,
which will be out in November,
some incredible AI
that was hidden in the dusty vaults,
collecting dust
in Microsoft,
plus our quite crude
attempts at AI
at a company called Lionhead,
mixing all those things together
just to get to this one simple idea:
to create a real, living
being in a computer.
Now, I'll be honest with you
and say that most of it
is just a trick,
but it's a trick that actually works.
a look at the demo now.
This is Dimitri.
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.
Now, you notice he's sitting.
There are no controllers,
no keyboards,
or mice,
or joysticks, or joypads.
He is just going to use
his hand, his body and his voice,
just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.
We had to give him a problem
because when we first created Milo,
we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,
to be honest with you.
He was quite a know-it-all,
and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.
So the problem we introduced to him was this:
he's just moved house.
He's moved from London
to New England, over in America.
His parents are too busy
to listen to his problems,
and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.
So here he is
walking through the grass.
And you're able to interact with his world.
The cool thing is, what we're doing
is we're changing the mind
of Milo constantly.
That means no two people's Milos
can be the same.
You're actually sculpting a human being here.
So, he's discovering the garden.
You're helping him discover the garden
by just pointing out these snails.
Very simple at the start.
By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;
if you're a girl, it's butterflies
because what we found was that girls hate snails.
and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.
His face, by the way,
is fully AI-driven.
We have complete control over his blush responses,
the diameter of his nostrils
to denote stress.
We actually do something called body matching.
If you're leaning forward,
he will try and slightly change
the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,
because we went out with this strong idea:
how can we make you believe that something's real?
Now we've used the hand.
The other thing to use is your body.
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right
with a mouse or with a joypad,
why not use your body just to lean on the chair --
again, relaxed?
You can lean back,
but the camera will change its perspective
depending on which way you're looking.
he's used his hand; he's used his body.
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,
and that's his voice.
Now, the thing about voice is,
our experience with voice recognition
is pretty awful, isn't it?
It never works.
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.
So we've tackled that problem,
and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.
but remember, even this choice
will affect how Milo develops.
Do you want Milo to squash it?
When you see the microphone,
say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.
Now look at his response.
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."
What we're using there is,
we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.
We've got a database of words which we recognize.
We pick those words out.
We also reference that
with the tonation database
that we build up of Dimitri's voice,
or the user's voice.
Now we need to have a bit more engagement,
and again, what we can do
is we can look at the body.
And we'll do that in a second.
Deep.
is teach Milo to skim stones.
We're actually teaching him.
It's very, very interesting
that men, more than women,
tend to be more competitive here.
They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,
but then they want to beat Milo,
where women,
they're more nurturing about this.
Okay, this is skimming stones.
How do you skim stones?
You stand up,
and you skim the stone.
It's that simple.
Just recognizing your body,
recognizing the body's motions, the tech,
understanding that you've gone
from sitting down to standing up.
Again, all of this is done
in the way us humans do things,
and that's crucially important
if we want Milo to appear real.
Try hitting the boat.
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.
giving us time to be alone
and to help him out.
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --
his parents had asked him to clean up his room.
And we're going to help him with this now.
But this is going to be an introduction,
and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.
We're trying to introduce you
to what I believe is the most wonderful part,
you being able to talk
in your natural voice to Milo.
Now, to do that, we needed a set up,
like a magician's trick.
And what we did was,
we needed to give Milo this big problem.
starts tidying up,
you can overhear a conversation
that Milo's having with his parents.
a plate of sausages on the floor,
on the brand-new carpet.
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.
Now's a chance for Dimitri
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.
It's all been too much for him.
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.
Now is the time
when we open that portal
and allow you to talk to Milo.
to cheer Milo up.
They're always getting stressed.
We don't know anyone.
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.
This looks nice.
You cleaned up my room.
Thanks.
he recognizes you.
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,
that is a truly wonderful moment.
And we're ready now
to tell a story about his childhood and his life,
and it goes on,
and he has, you know, many adventures.
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --
he's got to go to school.
that we're doing as well:
as you interact with him,
you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.
His mind is based in a cloud.
That means Milo's mind,
as millions of people use it,
will get smarter and cleverer.
He'll recognize more objects
and thus understand more words.
this is a wonderful opportunity
where technology, at last, can be connected with,
where I am no longer restrained
by the finger I hold in my hand --
as far as a computer game's concerned --
or by the blandness of not being noticed
if you're watching a film or a book.
And I love those revolutions,
and I love the future that Milo brings.
I grew up on a small farm in Missouri.
We lived on less than a dollar a day
for about 15 years.
I got a scholarship, went to university,
studied international agriculture, studied anthropology,
and decided I was going to give back.
I was going to work with small farmers.
I was going to help alleviate poverty.
I was going to work on international development,
and then I took a turn
and ended up here.
Now, if you get a Ph.D., and you decide not to teach,
you don't always end up in a place like this.
It's a choice. You might end up driving a taxicab.
You could be in New York.
What I found was,
I started working with refugees and famine victims --
small farmers, all, or nearly all --
who had been dispossessed and displaced.
Now, what I'd been trained to do
was methodological research on such people.
So I did it: I found out how many women
had been raped en route to these camps.
I found out how many people had been put in jail,
how many family members had been killed.
I assessed how long they were going to stay
and how much it would take to feed them.
And I got really good at predicting
how many body bags you would need
for the people who were going to die in these camps.
It's not the work I set out to do.
So I was at a Grateful Dead benefit concert on the rainforests
in 1988.
I met a guy -- the guy on the left.
His name was Ben.
He said, "What can I do to save the rainforests?"
I said, "Well, Ben, what do you do?"
"I make ice cream."
So I said, "Well, you've got to make
a rainforest ice cream.
And you've got to use nuts from the rainforests
to show that forests are worth more as forests
than they are as pasture."
He said, "Okay."
Within a year,
Rainforest Crunch was on the shelves.
It was a great success.
We did our first million-dollars-worth of trade
by buying on 30 days and selling on 21.
That gets your adrenaline going.
Then we had a four and a half million-dollar line of credit
because we were credit-worthy at that point.
We had 15 to 20, maybe 22 percent
of the global Brazil-nut market.
We paid two to three times more than anybody else.
Everybody else raised their prices to the gatherers of Brazil nuts
because we would buy it otherwise.
A great success.
50 companies signed up, 200 products came out,
generated 100 million in sales.
It failed.
Why did it fail?
Because the people who were gathering Brazil nuts
weren't the same people who were cutting the forests.
And the people who made money from Brazil nuts
were not the people who made money from cutting the forests.
We were attacking the wrong driver.
We needed to be working on beef.
We needed to be working on lumber.
We needed to be working on soy --
things that we were not focused on.
I often talk to refugees:
"Why was it that the West didn't realize
that famines are caused by policies and politics,
not by weather?"
And this farmer said to me, one day,
something that was very profound.
He said, "You can't wake a person who's pretending to sleep."
We live on a planet.
There's just one of them.
We've got to wake up to the fact
that we don't have any more
and that this is a finite planet.
We know the limits of the resources we have.
We may be able to use them differently.
We may have some innovative, new ideas.
But in general, this is what we've got.
There's no more of it.
There's a basic equation that we can't get away from.
Population times consumption
has got to have some kind of relationship to the planet,
and right now, it's a simple "not equal."
Our work shows that we're living
at about 1.3 planets.
Since 1990,
we crossed the line
of being in a sustainable relationship to the planet.
Now we're at 1.3.
If we were farmers, we'd be eating our seed.
For bankers, we'd be living off the principal, not the interest.
This is where we stand today.
A lot of people like to point
to some place else as the cause of the problem.
It's always population growth.
Population growth's important,
but it's also about how much each person consumes.
So when the average American
consumes 43 times as much
as the average African,
we've got to think that consumption is an issue.
It's not just about population,
and it's not just about them; it's about us.
But it's not just about people;
it's about lifestyles.
There's very good evidence --
again, we don't necessarily have
a peer-reviewed methodology
that's bulletproof yet --
but there's very good evidence
that the average cat in Europe
has a larger environmental footprint in its lifetime
than the average African.
You think that's not an issue going forward?
You think that's not a question
as to how we should be using the Earth's resources?
In 2000, we had six billion people on the planet.
They were consuming what they were consuming --
let's say one unit of consumption each.
We have six billion units of consumption.
By 2050,
we're going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree.
They're all going to consume twice as much as they currently do --
scientists, again, agree --
because income is going to grow in developing countries
five times what it is today --
on global average, about [2.9].
So we're going to have 18 billion units of consumption.
Who have you heard talking lately
that's said we have to triple production
of goods and services?
But that's what the math says.
We're not going to be able to do that.
We can get productivity up.
We can get efficiency up.
But we've also got to get consumption down.
We need to use less
to make more.
And then we need to use less again.
And then we need to consume less.
All of those things are part of that equation.
should consumers have a choice
about sustainability, about sustainable products?
Should you be able to buy a product that's sustainable
sitting next to one that isn't,
or should all the products on the shelf be sustainable?
If they should all be sustainable on a finite planet,
how do you make that happen?
The average consumer takes 1.8 seconds in the U.S.
Okay, so let's be generous.
Let's say it's 3.5 seconds in Europe.
How do you evaluate all the scientific data
around a product,
the data that's changing on a weekly, if not a daily, basis?
How do you get informed?
You don't.
Here's a little question.
From a greenhouse gas perspective,
is lamb produced in the U.K.
better than lamb produced in New Zealand,
frozen and shipped to the U.K.?
Is a bad feeder lot operation for beef
better or worse than
a bad grazing operation for beef?
Do organic potatoes
actually have fewer toxic chemicals
used to produce them
than conventional potatoes?
In every single case,
the answer is "it depends."
It depends on who produced it and how,
in every single instance.
And there are many others.
How is a consumer going to walk through this minefield?
They're not.
They may have a lot of opinions about it,
but they're not going to be terribly informed.
It's got to be something we all care about.
And we need collusion.
We need groups to work together that never have.
We need Cargill to work with Bunge.
We need Coke to work with Pepsi.
We need Oxford to work with Cambridge.
We need Greenpeace to work with WWF.
Everybody's got to work together --
China and the U.S.
We need to begin to manage this planet
as if our life depended on it,
because it does,
it fundamentally does.
But we can't do everything.
Even if we get everybody working on it,
we've got to be strategic.
We need to focus on the where,
the what and the who.
So, the where:
We've identified 35 places globally that we need to work.
These are the places that are the richest in biodiversity
and the most important from an ecosystem function point-of-view.
We have to work in these places.
We have to save these places if we want a chance in hell
of preserving biodiversity as we know it.
We looked at the threats to these places.
These are the 15 commodities
that fundamentally pose the biggest threats
to these places
because of deforestation,
soil loss, water use, pesticide use,
over-fishing, etc.
we've got 15 priority commodities,
who do we work with
to change the way those commodities are produced?
Are we going to work with 6.9 billion consumers?
Let's see, that's about 7,000 languages,
350 major languages --
a lot of work there.
I don't see anybody actually being able
to do that very effectively.
Are we going to work with 1.5 billion producers?
Again, a daunting task.
There must be a better way.
300 to 500 companies
control 70 percent or more
of the trade of each of the 15 commodities
that we've identified as the most significant.
If we work with those, if we change those companies
and the way they do business,
then the rest will happen automatically.
So, we went through our 15 commodities.
This is nine of them.
We lined them up side-by-side,
and we put the names of the companies that work
on each of those.
And if you go through the first 25 or 30 names
of each of the commodities,
what you begin to see is,
gosh, there's Cargill here, there's Cargill there,
there's Cargill everywhere.
In fact, these names start coming up over and over again.
So we did the analysis again a slightly different way.
We said: if we take the top hundred companies,
what percentage
of all 15 commodities
do they touch, buy or sell?
And what we found is it's 25 percent.
So 100 companies
control 25 percent of the trade
of all 15 of the most significant
commodities on the planet.
We can get our arms around a hundred companies.
A hundred companies, we can work with.
Because if these companies demand sustainable products,
they'll pull 40 to 50 percent of production.
Companies can push producers
faster than consumers can.
By companies asking for this,
we can leverage production so much faster
than by waiting for consumers to do it.
After 40 years, the global organic movement
has achieved 0.7 of one percent
of global food.
We can't wait that long.
We don't have that kind of time.
We need change
that's going to accelerate.
Even working with individual companies
is not probably going to get us there.
We need to begin to work with industries.
So we've started roundtables
where we bring together the entire value chain,
from producers
all the way to the retailers and brands.
We bring in civil society, we bring in NGOs,
we bring in researchers and scientists
to have an informed discussion --
sometimes a battle royale --
to figure out what are the key impacts
of these products,
what is a global benchmark,
what's an acceptable impact,
and design standards around that.
It's not all fun and games.
we kicked off a roundtable
almost six years ago.
Eight entities came to the table.
We eventually got, I think, 60 percent
of global production at the table
and 25 percent of demand at the table.
Three of the original eight entities were suing each other.
And yet, next week, we launch
globally verified, vetted and certified
standards for salmon aquaculture.
It can happen.
the different entities to the table?
It's risk and demand.
For the big companies, it's reputational risk,
but more importantly,
they don't care what the price of commodities is.
If they don't have commodities, they don't have a business.
They care about availability,
so the big risk for them is not having product at all.
For the producers,
if a buyer wants to buy something produced a certain way,
that's what brings them to the table.
So it's the demand that brings them to the table.
The good news is
we identified a hundred companies two years ago.
In the last 18 months, we've signed agreements
with 40 of those hundred companies
to begin to work with them on their supply chain.
And in the next 18 months,
we will have signed up to work with another 40,
and we think we'll get those signed as well.
Now what we're doing is bringing the CEOs
of these 80 companies together
to help twist the arms of the final 20,
to bring them to the table,
because they don't like NGOs, they've never worked with NGOs,
they're concerned about this, they're concerned about that,
but we all need to be in this together.
So we're pulling out all the stops.
We're using whatever leverage we have to bring them to the table.
in baby steps, perhaps --
but has begun this journey on sustainability is Cargill.
They've funded research that shows
that we can double global palm oil production
without cutting a single tree in the next 20 years,
and do it all in Borneo alone
by planting on land that's already degraded.
The study shows that the highest net present value
for palm oil
is on land that's been degraded.
They're also undertaking a study to look at
all of their supplies of palm oil
to see if they could be certified
and what they would need to change in order to become third-party certified
under a credible certification program.
Why is Cargill important?
Because Cargill has 20 to 25 percent
of global palm oil.
If Cargill makes a decision,
the entire palm oil industry moves,
or at least 40 or 50 percent of it.
That's not insignificant.
More importantly, Cargill and one other company
ship 50 percent of the palm oil
that goes to China.
We don't have to change the way
a single Chinese company works
if we get Cargill to only send
sustainable palm oil to China.
It's a pre-competitive issue.
All the palm oil going there is good.
Buy it.
Now most people understand that Mars is a chocolate company,
but Mars has made sustainability pledges
to buy only certified product for all of its seafood.
It turns out Mars buys more seafood than Walmart
because of pet food.
But they're doing some really interesting things around chocolate,
and it all comes from the fact
that Mars wants to be in business in the future.
And what they see is that they need to
improve chocolate production.
On any given plantation,
20 percent of the trees produce 80 percent of the crop,
so Mars is looking at the genome,
they're sequencing the genome of the cocoa plant.
They're doing it with IBM and the USDA,
and they're putting it in the public domain
because they want everybody to have access to this data,
because they want everybody to help them
make cocoa more productive and more sustainable.
What they've realized
is that if they can identify the traits
on productivity and drought tolerance,
they can produce 320 percent as much cocoa
on 40 percent of the land.
The rest of the land can be used for something else.
It's more with less and less again.
That's what the future has got to be,
and putting it in the public domain is smart.
They don't want to be an I.P. company; they want to be a chocolate company,
but they want to be a chocolate company forever.
but in fact, the price of food is going down,
and that's odd because in fact,
consumers are not paying for the true cost of food.
If you take a look just at water,
what we see is that,
with four very common products,
you look at how much a farmer produced to make those products,
and then you look at how much water input was put into them,
and then you look at what the farmer was paid.
If you divide the amount of water
into what the farmer was paid,
the farmer didn't receive enough money
to pay a decent price for water in any of those commodities.
That is an externality by definition.
This is the subsidy from nature.
Coca-Cola, they've worked a lot on water,
but right now, they're entering into 17-year contracts
with growers in Turkey
to sell juice into Europe,
and they're doing that because they want to have a product
that's closer to the European market.
But they're not just buying the juice;
they're also buying the carbon in the trees
to offset the shipment costs associated with carbon
to get the product into Europe.
There's carbon that's being bought with sugar,
with coffee, with beef.
This is called bundling. It's bringing those externalities
back into the price of the commodity.
of what the best producers in the world are doing
and use that to inform government regulation,
so we can shift the entire performance curve.
We can't just focus on identifying the best;
we've got to move the rest.
These companies have begun to think differently.
They're on a journey; there's no turning back.
We're all on that same journey with them.
We have to really begin to change
the way we think about everything.
Whatever was sustainable on a planet of six billion
is not going to be sustainable on a planet with nine.
Last year when I was here, I was speaking to you about a swim
which I did across the North Pole.
And while that swim took place three years ago,
I can remember it as if it was yesterday.
I remember standing on the edge of the ice,
about to dive into the water,
and thinking to myself, I have never ever
seen any place on this earth
which is just so frightening.
The water is completely black.
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade,
or 29 degrees Fahrenheit.
It's flipping freezing in that water.
And then a thought came across my mind:
if things go pear-shaped on this swim,
how long will it take for my frozen body
to sink the four and a half kilometers
to the bottom of the ocean?
And then I said to myself, I've just got to get this thought
out of my mind as quickly as possible.
And the only way I can dive
into that freezing cold water
and swim a kilometer
is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up,
listening to everything from beautiful opera
all the way across to Puff Daddy,
and then committing myself a hundred percent --
there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind --
and then walking up to the edge of the ice
and just diving into the water.
18 minutes and 50 seconds,
and it felt like 18 days.
And I remember getting out of the water
and my hands feeling so painful
and looking down at my fingers,
and my fingers were literally the size of sausages
because -- you know, we're made partially of water --
when water freezes it expands,
and so the cells in my fingers
had frozen and expanded
and burst.
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water
was the following:
I'm never, ever
going to do another cold water swim
in my life again.
and the melting of the -- (Laughter)
and the melting of the glaciers
because of climate change.
I heard about this lake, Lake Imja.
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years
because of the melting of the glacier.
The glacier's gone all the way up the mountain
and left in its place this big lake.
And I firmly believe
that what we're seeing in the Himalayas
is the next great, big battleground
on this earth.
Nearly two billion people --
so one in three people on this earth --
rely on the water from the Himalayas.
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is,
and with the water supply from these glaciers --
because of climate change --
decreasing so much,
I think we have a real risk of instability.
North, you've got China; south, you've India, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
all these countries.
to walk up to Mt. Everest,
the highest mountain on this earth,
and go and do a symbolic swim
underneath the summit
of Mt. Everest.
Now, I don't know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt. Everest,
but it's quite an ordeal getting up there.
28 great, big, powerful yaks
carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain --
I don't just have my Speedo,
but there's a big film crew who then
send all the images around the world.
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim
is not just the altitude.
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level.
So it's right up in the heavens.
It's very, very difficult to breath. You get altitude sickness.
I feels like you've got a man standing behind you with a hammer
just hitting your head all the time.
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided
to do a big cleanup operation on Mt. Everest.
Many, many people have died on Mt. Everest,
and this was the year they decided to go
and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers
and then bring them down the mountain.
And when you're walking up the mountain
to attempt to do something
which no human has ever done before, and, in fact, no fish --
there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters --
When you're trying to do that,
and then the bodies are coming past you,
it humbles you,
and you also realize very, very clearly
that nature is so much more powerful
than we are.
all the way up.
And to the right hand side of us
was this great Khumbu Glacier.
And all the way along the glacier we saw
these big pools of melting ice.
And then we got up to this small lake
underneath the summit of Mt. Everest,
and I prepared myself
the same way as I've always prepared myself,
for this swim which was going to be so very difficult.
I put on my iPod, I listened to some music,
I got myself as aggressive as possible --
but controlled aggression --
and then I hurled myself
into that water.
for the first hundred meters,
and then I realized very, very quickly,
I had a huge problem on my hands.
I could barely breathe.
I was gasping for air.
I then began to choke,
and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water.
And it all happened so quickly:
I then -- I don't know how it happened -- but I went underwater.
And luckily, the water was quite shallow,
and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake
and get up and then take another gasp of air.
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on.
I carried on for another five or six strokes,
and then I had nothing in my body,
and I went down to the bottom of the lake.
And I don't where I got it from,
but I was able to somehow
pull myself up and as quickly as possible
get to the side of the lake.
I've heard it said that drowning
is the most peaceful death that you can have.
I have never, ever heard
such utter bollocks.
(Laughter)
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling
that you can have.
My crew grabbed me,
and then we walked as quickly as we could
down -- over the rubble --
down to our camp.
And there, we sat down,
and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong
there on Mt. Everest.
And my team just gave it to me straight.
They said, Lewis, you need to have
a radical tactical shift
if you want to do this swim.
Every single thing which you have learned
in the past 23 years of swimming,
you must forget.
Every single thing which you learned
when you were serving in the British army,
about speed and aggression,
you put that to one side.
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days' time.
Take some time to rest and think about things.
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days' time,
and instead of swimming fast,
swim as slowly as possible.
Instead of swimming crawl, swim breaststroke.
And remember, never ever swim with aggression.
This is the time to swim
with real humility.
to the mountain two days later.
And I stood there
on the edge of the lake,
and I looked up at Mt. Everest --
and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth --
and I said to myself, just do this slowly.
And I swam across the lake.
And I can't begin to tell you
how good I felt
when I came to the other side.
important lessons there on Mt. Everest,
and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this.
The first one is
that just because something has worked in the past so well,
doesn't mean it's going to work in the future.
And similarly,
now, before I do anything,
I ask myself what type of mindset
do I require
to successfully complete a task.
And taking that into the world of climate change --
which is, frankly,
the Mt. Everest of all problems --
just because we've lived the way we have lived for so long,
just because we have consumed the way we have for so long
and populated the earth the way we have for so long,
doesn't mean that we can carry on
the way we are carrying on.
The warning signs are all there.
When I was born, the world's population
was 3.5 billion people.
We're now 6.8 billion people,
and we're expected to be 9 billion people
by 2050.
the radical, tactical shift.
And I've come here to ask you today:
what radical tactical shift
can you take in your relationship to the environment,
which will ensure
that our children and our grandchildren
live in a safe world
and a secure world,
and most importantly, in a sustainable world?
And I ask you, please, to go away from here
and think about that one
radical tactical shift
which you could make,
which will make that big difference,
and then commit a hundred percent to doing it.
Blog about it, tweet about it, talk about it,
and commit a hundred percent,
because very, very few things
are impossible to achieve
if we really put our whole minds to it.
Cartoons are basically short stories.
I tried to find one that didn't have a whole lot of words.
Not all of them have happy endings.
So how did I get started cartooning?
I doodled a lot as a kid,
and if you spend enough time doodling,
sooner or later, something happens:
all your career options run out.
So you have to make a living cartooning.
when I was about eight or nine.
And I was particularly fascinated with sharks.
This is some of my early work.
Eventually, my mom took the red crayon away,
so it was [unclear].
But I'd like to relay to you a childhood experience of mine
that really made me see the ocean differently,
and it's become the foundation of my work
because, I feel like, if in a day,
I can see the ocean differently,
then I can evoke that same kind of change in others,
especially kids.
Before that day, this is how I saw the ocean.
It's just a big blue surface.
And this is how we've seen the ocean since the beginning of time.
It's a mystery.
There's been a lot of folklore
developed around the ocean,
mostly negative.
And that prompted people to make maps like this,
with all kinds of wonderful detail on the land,
but when you get to the waters edge,
the ocean looks like one giant puddle of blue paint.
And this is the way I saw the ocean at school --
as if to say, "All geography and science lessons
stop at water's edge.
This part's not going to be on the test."
it was a family trip to the Caribbean,
and I flew in a small plane low over the islands.
This is what I saw. I saw hills and valleys.
I saw forests and meadows.
I saw grottoes and secret gardens
and places I'd love to hide as a kid,
if I could only breathe underwater.
And best of all, I saw the animals.
I saw a manta ray that looked as big as the plane I was flying in.
And I flew over a lagoon with a shark in it,
and that was the day that my comic strip about a shark was born.
walking around on dry land,
but my head was down there, underwater.
Up until that day,
these were the animals that were most common in my life.
These were the ones I'd like to draw --
all variations of four legs and fur.
But when you got to the ocean,
my imagination was no competition for nature.
Every time I'd come up with a crazy cartoon character on the drawing board,
I'd find a critter in the ocean that was even crazier.
And the differences in scale between this tiny sea dragon
and this enormous humpback whale
was like something out of a science-fiction movie.
the biggest animal that ever lived is still alive.
It's not a dinosaur; it's a whale,
animals as big as office buildings
still swimming around out there in our ocean.
Speaking of dinosaurs, sharks are basically
the same fish they were 300 million years ago.
So if you ever fantasize about going back in time
and seeing what a dinosaur looked like,
that's what a dinosaur looks like.
So you have living dinosaurs
and space aliens,
animals that evolved in zero gravity in harsh conditions.
It's just incredible; no Hollywood designer
could come up with something more interesting than that.
Or this fangtooth. The particles in the water
make it look like it's floating in outer space.
Could you image if we looked through the Hubble Telescope
and we saw that?
It would start a whole new space race.
But instead, we stick a camera in the deep ocean,
and we see a fish, and it doesn't capture our imagination
as a society.
We say to ourselves,
"Maybe we can make fish sticks with it or something."
is try a little drawing.
So, I'm going to try to draw this fangtooth here.
I love to draw the deep sea fish,
because they are so ugly,
but beautiful in their own way.
Maybe we can give him a little bioluminescence here --
give him a headlight,
maybe a brake light,
turn signals.
But it's easy to see why these animals
make such great cartoon characters,
their shapes and sizes.
So some of them actually seem to have powers
like superheroes in a comic book.
For instance,
take these sea turtles.
They kind of have a sixth sense
like Superman's x-ray vision.
They can sense the magnetic fields of the earth.
And they can use that sense
to navigate hundreds of miles of open ocean.
I kind of give my turtle hands
just to make them an easier cartoon character to work with.
Or take this sea cucumber.
It's not an animal we draw cartoons of
or draw at all.
He's like an underwater Spiderman.
He shoots out these sticky webs
to entangle his enemy.
Of course, sea cucumbers shoot them out their rears,
which, in my opinion, makes them much more interesting a superhero.
(Laughter)
He can't spin a web anytime; he's got to pull his pants down first.
The blowfish is like the Incredible Hulk.
It can change its body
into a big, intimidating fish
in a matter of seconds.
I'm going to draw this blowfish uninflated.
And then I'm going to attempt
onscreen animation here.
Let's see.
Try and inflate it.
(Laughter)
"You talkin' to me?" See, he can inflate himself
when he wants to be intimidating.
Or take this swordfish.
Could you imagine being born with a tool for a nose?
Do you think he wakes up in the morning, looks in the mirror and says,
"Somebody's getting stabbed today."
Or this lionfish for instance.
Imagine trying to make friends
covered with razor-sharp poisonous barbs.
It's not something you want to put on your Facebook page, right?
my lead character's a shark named Sherman.
He's a great white shark.
And I kind of broke the mold with Sherman.
I didn't want to go with this ruthless
predator image.
He's kind of just out there making a living.
He's sort of a Homer Simpson with fins.
And then his sidekick
is a sea turtle, as I mentioned before, named Filmore.
He uses his wonderful skills at navigation
to wander the oceans, looking for a mate.
And he does manage to find them,
but great navigation skills, lousy pick-up lines.
He never seems
to settle on
any particular girl.
I have a hermit crab named Hawthorne,
who doesn't get a lot of respect as a hermit crab,
so he kind of wishes
he were a great white shark.
And then I'll introduce you to one more character,
this guy, Ernest,
who is basically a juvenile delinquent
in a fish body.
Sometimes making a story is as easy
as putting two characters in a room
and seeing what happens.
So, imagine a great white shark and a giant squid in the same bathroom.
(Laughter)
Or, sometimes I take them to places
that people have never heard of because they're underwater.
For instance, I took them skiing in the Mid-Atlantic Range,
which is this range of mountains in the middle of the Atlantic.
I've taken them to the Sea of Japan,
where they met giant jellyfish.
I've taken them camping in the kelp forests of California.
I did a story on the census of marine life.
And that was a lot of fun because, as most of you know,
it's a real project we've heard about.
But it was a chance for me to introduce readers
to a lot of crazy undersea characters.
So we start off the story with Ernest,
who volunteers as a census taker.
He goes down and he meets this famous anglerfish.
Then he meets the yeti crab,
the famous vampire squid -- elusive, hard to find --
and the Dumbo octopus, which looks so much like a cartoon in real life
that really didn't have to change a thing when I drew it.
I was speaking to a lot of my friends
in the conservation business,
and they --
I asked them, "So what's one issue you would like everyone to know more about?"
And they said -- this one friend of mine said,
"I've got one word for you: plastic."
And I told him, "Well, I need something a little sexier than that.
Plastic just is not going to do it."
We sort of worked things out.
He wanted me to use words like polyvinyl chloride,
which doesn't really work in voice balloons very well.
I couldn't fit them in.
So what I did was I made an adventure strip.
What I'm trying to tell readers
is that plastic doesn't really go away;
it just continues to wash downstream.
And a lot of it ends up washing into the ocean,
which is a great story if you attach a couple characters to it,
especially if they can't stand each other, like these two.
So, I sent them to Boise, Idaho,
where they dropped a plastic bottle
into the Boise sewer system.
And it ended up in the Boise River
and then on to the Columbia River
and then to the mouth of the Columbia
and to the Pacific Ocean
and then on to this place called the Great Pacific Garbage Patch --
which is this giant Pacific gyre in the North Pacific,
where a lot of this plastic ends up floating around --
and then back onto the lagoon.
So that was basically a buddy story
with a plastic bottle following along.
So a lot of people remember the plastic bottle anyway,
but we really talked about marine debris and plastic
in the course of that one.
was probably my most difficult.
It was on shark finning, and I felt really strongly
about this issue.
And I felt like, since my main character was a shark,
the comic strip was a perfect vehicle for telling the public about this.
Now, finning is the act
of taking a shark, cutting the valuable fins off
and throwing the live animal back in the water.
It's cruel, it's wasteful.
There's nothing funny or entertaining about it,
but I really wanted to take this issue on.
I had to kill my main character, who is a shark.
who gets a fortune that he's about to get caught by a trawler,
which he does.
And then he dies.
He gets finned, and then he gets thrown overboard.
Ostensibly, he's dead now.
And so I killed a character that's been in the newspaper for 15 years.
So I got a lot of reader feedback on that one.
Meanwhile, the other characters are talking about shark fin soup.
I do three or four strips after that
where we explore the finning issue
and the shark fin soup issue.
Sherman's up in shark heaven.
This is what I love about comic strips, you know.
You really don't have to worry about the audience suspending its sense of disbelief
because, if you start with a talking shark,
readers pretty much check their disbelief at the door.
You can kind of do anything.
It becomes a near-death experience for Sherman.
Meanwhile, Ernest finds his fins on the internet.
There was a real website based in China
that actually sold shark fins,
so I kind of exposed that.
And he clicks the "buy now" button.
And voila, next-day air, they show up,
and they surgically reattach them.
I ended that series with a kind of a mail-in petition
that encouraged our National Marine Fishery Service,
to force other countries
to have a stronger stance with shark management.
I'd like to end with a little metaphor here.
I've been trying to think of a metaphor to represent Mission Blue,
and this is what I came up with.
Imagine you're in an enormous room,
and it's as dark as a cave.
And you can have anything in that room, anything you want,
but you can't see anything.
You've been given one tool, a hammer.
So you wander around in the darkness, and you bump into something,
and it feels like it's made of stone.
It's big, it's heavy. You can't carry it away,
so you bang it with your hammer, and you break off a piece.
And you take the piece out into the daylight.
And you see you have a beautiful piece of white alabaster.
So you say to yourself, "Well, that's worth something."
So you go back into the room,
and you break this thing to pieces, and you haul it away.
And you find other things, and you break that up, and you haul those away.
And you're getting all kinds of cool stuff.
And you hear other people doing the same thing.
So you get this sense of urgency,
like you need to find as much stuff as possible as soon as possible.
And then some yells, "Stop!"
And they turn up the lights.
And you realize where you are; you're in the Louvre.
And you've taken all this complexity and beauty,
and you've turned it into a cheap commodity.
And part of what Mission Blue is about
is yelling, "Stop!"
so that each of us --
explorer, scientist, cartoonist, singer, chef --
can turn up the lights in their own way.
And that's what I hope my comic strip does in a small way.
That's why I like what I do.
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today
rarely makes the front pages.
It, however, is enormous
in both scale and importance.
Look, you all are very well traveled;
this is TEDGlobal after all.
But I do hope to take you to some places
you've never been to before.
This photo was taken two weeks ago.
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders
has just graduated from high school.
(Laughter)
But this is Tiananmen Square.
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.
Let me take you to the real China.
This is in the Dabian Mountains
in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.
She lives with her parents,
her two brothers and her great-aunt.
They have a hut that has no electricity,
no running water,
no wristwatch, no bicycle.
And they share this great splendor
with a very large pig.
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,
"We're going to pull you out of school
because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.
Why would we waste this money on you?"
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.
the best pupil in her grade.
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse
and tried to catch every little bit of information
that seeped out of the doors.
We wrote about her in The New York Times.
We got a flood of donations --
mostly 13-dollar checks
because New York Times readers are very generous
in tiny amounts
(Laughter)
but then, we got a money transfer
for $10,000 --
really nice guy.
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.
He was delighted.
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.
I can give scholarships to all the girls,
you know, if they work hard and stay in school.
So Dai Manju basically
finished out middle school.
She went to high school.
She went to vocational school for accounting.
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.
She found a job, she scouted for jobs
for her classmates and her friends.
She sent money back to her family.
They built a new house,
this time with running water,
electricity, a bicycle,
no pig.
It is rare to get an exogenous investment
in girls' education.
And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see
that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle
and into a virtuous cycle.
She not only changed her own dynamic,
she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.
The village became a real standout.
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time,
but they were able to get a road built
to link them up to the rest of China.
of two tenets of "Half the Sky."
And that is that
the central moral challenge
of this century
is gender inequity.
In the 19th century, it was slavery.
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.
The cause of our time
is the brutality that so many people
face around the world because of their gender.
So some of you may be thinking,
"Gosh, that's hyperbole.
She's exaggerating."
Well, let me ask you this question.
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?
Hands up, please.
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?
Okay, most of you.
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.
There are, true enough,
in Europe and the West,
when women and men
have equal access to food and health care,
there are more women, we live longer.
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.
In fact, demographers have shown
that there are anywhere between 60 million
and 100 million
missing females in the current population.
For instance, in the last half-century,
more girls were discriminated to death
than all the people killed on all the battlefields
in the 20th century.
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.
Girls get aborted before they're even born
when there are scarce resources.
This girl here, for instance,
is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.
The entire center was filled with girls like her.
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,
were totally fine.
In India, in the first year of life,
from zero to one,
boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate
because they depend upon the breast,
and the breast shows no son preference.
From one to five,
girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate
than boys, in all of India.
is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,
and just on a purely practical level,
we think that
one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism
is to educate girls
and to bring women into the formal labor force.
Poverty, for instance.
There are three reasons why this is the case.
For one, overpopulation is one of
the persistent causes of poverty.
And you know, when you educate a boy,
his family tends to have fewer kids,
but only slightly.
When you educate a girl,
she tends to have significantly fewer kids.
The second reason is
it has to do with spending.
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,
which is that,
not only do poor people
take in very little income,
but also, the income that they take in,
they don't spend it very wisely,
and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.
So research has shown,
if you look at people who live under two dollars a day --
one metric of poverty --
two percent of that take-home pay
goes to this basket here, in education.
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of
alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks --
and prostitution and festivals.
If you just take four percentage points
and put it into this basket,
you would have a transformative effect.
with women being part of the solution, not the problem.
You need to use scarce resources.
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.
Bill Gates put it very well
when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.
On this side was men,
and then the barrier, and this side was women.
And someone from this side of the room got up and said,
"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia
to be one of the top 10 countries
when it comes to technology.
Do you think we'll make it?"
So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,
"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,
there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."
So here is Bill of Arabia.
look like?
I would say, on the top of the agenda
is sex trafficking.
And I'll just say two things about this.
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade
in the 1780s:
there were about 80,000 slaves
transported from Africa to the New World.
Now, modern slavery:
according to State Department rough statistics,
there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number --
that are trafficked across international borders.
And that does not even include those
that are trafficked within country borders,
which is a substantial portion.
And if you look at
another factor, another contrast,
a slave back then is worth
about $40,000
in today's money.
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked
for a few hundred dollars,
which means she's actually more disposable.
But you know, there is progress being made
in places like Cambodia and Thailand.
We don't have to expect a world
where girls are bought and sold or killed.
is maternal mortality.
You know, childbirth in this part of the world
is a wonderful event.
In Niger, one in seven women
can expect to die during childbirth.
Around the world,
one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.
You know, it's not as though
we don't have the technological solution,
but these women have three strikes against them:
they are poor, they are rural
and they are female.
You know, for every woman who does die,
there are 20 who survive
but end up with an injury.
And the most devastating injury
is obstetric fistula.
It's a tearing during obstructed labor
that leaves a woman incontinent.
She lives in Ethiopia.
She was married against her will at age 13.
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,
but you know, her body was very immature,
and she ended up having obstructed labor.
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.
So that meant she was incontinent;
she couldn't control her wastes.
In a word, she stank.
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.
They ripped off the door
so that the hyenas would get her at night.
That night, there was a stick in the hut.
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.
And the next morning,
she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,
she would be saved.
Because she had some damage to her nerves,
she crawled all the way -- 30 miles --
to that doorstep, half dead.
The foreign missionary opened the door,
knew exactly what had happened,
took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,
and she was repaired
with a 350-dollar operation.
The doctors and nurses there noticed
that she was not only a survivor,
she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.
So now, Mahabuba,
she is saving the lives
of hundreds, thousands, of women.
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.
She's moved out of a vicious cycle
and into a virtuous cycle.
let me talk about some of the solutions,
and there are predictable solutions.
I've hinted at them: education
and also economic opportunity.
So of course, when you educate a girl,
she tends to get married later on in life,
she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,
and those kids that she does have,
she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.
With economic opportunity,
it can be transformative.
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.
And at the time, she was miserable.
She was beaten every single day
by her husband, who was unemployed.
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore --
and took his frustrations out on her.
Well, when she had her second daughter,
her mother in-law told her son,
"I think you'd better get a second wife.
Saima's not going to produce you a son."
This is when she had her second daughter.
At the time, there was
a microlending group in the village
that gave her a 65-dollar loan.
Saima took that money,
and she started an embroidery business.
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,
and they kept asking for more.
And when she couldn't produce enough,
she hired other women in the village.
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village
working for her embroidery business.
And then,
when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods
from the village to the marketplace,
she needed someone to help her do the transport,
so she hired her husband.
So now they're in it together.
He does the transportation and distribution,
and she does the production and sourcing.
And now they have a third daughter,
and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education
because Saima knows what's really important.
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,
once said that, "It may well be
that the highest return on investment
in the developing world
is in girls' education."
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.
Beatrice was living in Uganda
near the Congo border,
and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.
Actually, she had never been to school,
not to a lick, one day.
Her parents, again, said,
"Why should we spend the money on her?
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."
Well, it just so happens, at that time,
there was a group in Connecticut
called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.
They made a donation to an organization
based in Arkansas
called Heifer International.
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,
and that goat had twins.
The twins started producing milk.
They sold the milk for cash.
The cash started accumulating,
and pretty soon the parents said,
"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."
So at nine years of age,
Beatrice started in first grade --
after all, she'd never been to a lick of school --
with a six year-old.
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.
She rocketed to the top of her class.
She stayed at the top of her class
through elementary school, middle school,
and then in high school,
she scored brilliantly on the national examinations
so that she became the first person in her village,
ever, to come to the United States
on scholarship.
Two years ago,
she graduated from Connecticut College.
On the day of her graduation,
she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive
because of a goat."
(Laughter)
And that goat was $120.
little bits of help can be.
But I want to give you a reality check.
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,
and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.
There's Bill Easterly's book.
There's a book called "Dead Aid."
You know, the criticism is fair;
it isn't easy.
You know, people say how
half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.
When I was in Zimbabwe,
we were touring a place with the village chief --
he wanted to raise money for a secondary school --
and there was some construction a few yards away,
and I said, "What's that?"
He sort of mumbled.
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;
you actually improve.
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.
can make a difference, and they should,
because individuals, together,
we can all help create a movement.
And a movement of men and women
is what's needed to bring about social change,
change that will address
this great moral challenge.
So then, I ask,
what's in it for you?
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?
I will just leave you with two things.
One is that research shows
that once you have
all of your material needs taken care of --
which most of us, all of us, here in this room do --
research shows that
there are very few things in life
that can actually elevate your level of happiness.
One of those things
is contributing to a cause larger than yourself.
it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.
And that is the story
of an aid worker in Darfur.
Here was a woman
who had worked in Darfur,
seeing things that no human being should see.
Throughout her time there,
she was strong, she was steadfast.
She never broke down.
And then she came back to the United States
and was on break, Christmas break.
She was in her grandmother's backyard,
and she saw something that made her break down in tears.
What that was
was a bird feeder.
And she realized that she had the great fortune
to be born in a country
where we take security for granted,
where we not only can feed, clothe
and house ourselves,
but also provide for wild birds
so they don't go hungry in the winter.
And she realized that with that great fortune
comes great responsibility.
And so, like her,
you, me,
we have all won the lottery of life.
And so the question becomes:
how do we discharge that responsibility?
Join the movement.
Feel happier and help save the world.
I want to start my talk today with two observations
about the human species.
The first observation is something that you might think is quite obvious,
and that's that our species, Homo sapiens,
is actually really, really smart --
like, ridiculously smart --
like you're all doing things
that no other species on the planet does right now.
And this is, of course,
not the first time you've probably recognized this.
Of course, in addition to being smart, we're also an extremely vain species.
So we like pointing out the fact that we're smart.
You know, so I could turn to pretty much any sage
from Shakespeare to Stephen Colbert
to point out things like the fact that
we're noble in reason and infinite in faculties
and just kind of awesome-er than anything else on the planet
when it comes to all things cerebral.
that I want to focus on a little bit more,
and that's the fact that
even though we're actually really smart, sometimes uniquely smart,
we can also be incredibly, incredibly dumb
when it comes to some aspects of our decision making.
Now I'm seeing lots of smirks out there.
Don't worry, I'm not going to call anyone in particular out
on any aspects of your own mistakes.
But of course, just in the last two years
we see these unprecedented examples of human ineptitude.
And we've watched as the tools we uniquely make
to pull the resources out of our environment
kind of just blow up in our face.
We've watched the financial markets that we uniquely create --
these markets that were supposed to be foolproof --
we've watched them kind of collapse before our eyes.
don't highlight what I think is most embarrassing
about the mistakes that humans make,
which is that we'd like to think that the mistakes we make
are really just the result of a couple bad apples
or a couple really sort of FAIL Blog-worthy decisions.
But it turns out, what social scientists are actually learning
is that most of us, when put in certain contexts,
will actually make very specific mistakes.
The errors we make are actually predictable.
We make them again and again.
And they're actually immune to lots of evidence.
When we get negative feedback,
we still, the next time we're face with a certain context,
tend to make the same errors.
And so this has been a real puzzle to me
as a sort of scholar of human nature.
What I'm most curious about is,
how is a species that's as smart as we are
capable of such bad
and such consistent errors all the time?
In some sense, where do our mistakes really come from?
And having thought about this a little bit, I see a couple different possibilities.
One possibility is, in some sense, it's not really our fault.
Because we're a smart species,
we can actually create all kinds of environments
that are super, super complicated,
sometimes too complicated for us to even actually understand,
even though we've actually created them.
We create financial markets that are super complex.
We create mortgage terms that we can't actually deal with.
And of course, if we are put in environments where we can't deal with it,
in some sense makes sense that we actually
might mess certain things up.
If this was the case, we'd have a really easy solution
to the problem of human error.
We'd actually just say, okay, let's figure out
the kinds of technologies we can't deal with,
the kinds of environments that are bad --
get rid of those, design things better,
and we should be the noble species
that we expect ourselves to be.
which is, maybe it's not our environments that are messed up.
Maybe it's actually us that's designed badly.
This is a hint that I've gotten
from watching the ways that social scientists have learned about human errors.
And what we see is that people tend to keep making errors
exactly the same way, over and over again.
It feels like we might almost just be built
to make errors in certain ways.
This is a possibility that I worry a little bit more about,
because, if it's us that's messed up,
it's not actually clear how we go about dealing with it.
We might just have to accept the fact that we're error prone
and try to design things around it.
How can we tell the difference between possibility one and possibility two?
What we need is a population
that's basically smart, can make lots of decisions,
but doesn't have access to any of the systems we have,
any of the things that might mess us up --
no human technology, human culture,
maybe even not human language.
And so this is why we turned to these guys here.
These are one of the guys I work with. This is a brown capuchin monkey.
These guys are New World primates,
which means they broke off from the human branch
about 35 million years ago.
This means that your great, great, great great, great, great --
with about five million "greats" in there --
grandmother was probably the same great, great, great, great
grandmother with five million "greats" in there
as Holly up here.
You know, so you can take comfort in the fact that this guy up here is a really really distant,
but albeit evolutionary, relative.
The good news about Holly though is that
she doesn't actually have the same kinds of technologies we do.
You know, she's a smart, very cut creature, a primate as well,
but she lacks all the stuff we think might be messing us up.
Does she make the same mistakes as us?
Does she not learn from them? And so on.
And so this is the kind of thing we decided to do.
My students and I got very excited about this a few years ago.
We said, all right, let's, you know, throw so problems at Holly,
see if she messes these things up.
First problem is just, well, where should we start?
Because, you know, it's great for us, but bad for humans.
We make a lot of mistakes in a lot of different contexts.
You know, where are we actually going to start with this?
And because we started this work around the time of the financial collapse,
around the time when foreclosures were hitting the news,
we said, hhmm, maybe we should
actually start in the financial domain.
Maybe we should look at monkey's economic decisions
and try to see if they do the same kinds of dumb things that we do.
a little bit more methodological --
which is that, maybe you guys don't know,
but monkeys don't actually use money. I know, you haven't met them.
But this is why, you know, they're not in the queue behind you
at the grocery store or the ATM -- you know, they don't do this stuff.
So now we faced, you know, a little bit of a problem here.
How are we actually going to ask monkeys about money
if they don't actually use it?
So we said, well, maybe we should just, actually just suck it up
and teach monkeys how to use money.
So that's just what we did.
What you're looking at over here is actually the first unit that I know of
of non-human currency.
We weren't very creative at the time we started these studies,
so we just called it a token.
But this is the unit of currency that we've taught our monkeys at Yale
to actually use with humans,
to actually buy different pieces of food.
It doesn't look like much -- in fact, it isn't like much.
As those of you who've taken currencies home from your trip know,
once you get home, it's actually pretty useless.
It was useless to the monkeys at first
before they realized what they could do with it.
When we first gave it to them in their enclosures,
they actually kind of picked them up, looked at them.
They were these kind of weird things.
But very quickly, the monkeys realized
that they could actually hand these tokens over
to different humans in the lab for some food.
And so you see one of our monkeys, Mayday, up here doing this.
This is A and B are kind of the points where she's sort of a little bit
curious about these things -- doesn't know.
There's this waiting hand from a human experimenter,
and Mayday quickly figures out, apparently the human wants this.
Hands it over, and then gets some food.
It turns out not just Mayday, all of our monkeys get good
at trading tokens with human salesman.
So here's just a quick video of what this looks like.
Here's Mayday. She's going to be trading a token for some food
and waiting happily and getting her food.
Here's Felix, I think. He's our alpha male; he's a kind of big guy.
But he too waits patiently, gets his food and goes on.
They're surprisingly good at this with very little training.
We just allowed them to pick this up on their own.
The question is: is this anything like human money?
Is this a market at all,
or did we just do a weird psychologist's trick
by getting monkeys to do something,
looking smart, but not really being smart.
And so we said, well, what would the monkeys spontaneously do
if this was really their currency, if they were really using it like money?
Well, you might actually imagine them
to do all the kinds of smart things
that humans do when they start exchanging money with each other.
You might have them start paying attention to price,
paying attention to how much they buy --
sort of keeping track of their monkey token, as it were.
Do the monkeys do anything like this?
The way this works is that
our monkeys normally live in a kind of big zoo social enclosure.
When they get a hankering for some treats,
we actually allowed them a way out
into a little smaller enclosure where they could enter the market.
Upon entering the market --
it was actually a much more fun market for the monkeys than most human markets
because, as the monkeys entered the door of the market,
a human would give them a big wallet full of tokens
so they could actually trade the tokens
with one of these two guys here --
two different possible human salesmen
that they could actually buy stuff from.
The salesmen were students from my lab.
They dressed differently; they were different people.
And over time, they did basically the same thing
so the monkeys could learn, you know,
who sold what at what price -- you know, who was reliable, who wasn't, and so on.
And you can see that each of the experimenters
is actually holding up a little, yellow food dish.
and that's what the monkey can for a single token.
So everything costs one token,
but as you can see, sometimes tokens buy more than others,
sometimes more grapes than others.
Here's a monkey-eye-view. Monkeys are shorter, so it's a little short.
But here's Honey.
She's waiting for the market to open a little impatiently.
All of a sudden the market opens. Here's her choice: one grapes or two grapes.
You can see Honey, very good market economist,
goes with the guy who gives more.
She could teach our financial advisers a few things or two.
So not just Honey,
most of the monkeys went with guys who had more.
Most of the monkeys went with guys who had better food.
When we introduced sales, we saw the monkeys paid attention to that.
They really cared about their monkey token dollar.
The more surprising thing was that when we collaborated with economists
to actually look at the monkeys' data using economic tools,
they basically matched, not just qualitatively,
but quantitatively with what we saw
humans doing in a real market.
So much so that, if you saw the monkeys' numbers,
you couldn't tell whether they came from a monkey or a human in the same market.
is like we'd actually introduced something
that, at least for the monkeys and us,
works like a real financial currency.
Question is: do the monkeys start messing up in the same ways we do?
Well, we already saw anecdotally a couple of signs that they might.
One thing we never saw in the monkey marketplace
was any evidence of saving --
you know, just like our own species.
The monkeys entered the market, spent their entire budget
and then went back to everyone else.
The other thing we also spontaneously saw,
embarrassingly enough,
is spontaneous evidence of larceny.
The monkeys would rip-off the tokens at every available opportunity --
from each other, often from us --
you know, things we didn't necessarily think we were introducing,
but things we spontaneously saw.
Can we actually see if the monkeys
are doing exactly the same dumb things as humans do?
One possibility is just kind of let
the monkey financial system play out,
you know, see if they start calling us for bailouts in a few years.
We were a little impatient so we wanted
to sort of speed things up a bit.
So we said, let's actually give the monkeys
the same kinds of problems
that humans tend to get wrong
in certain kinds of economic challenges,
or certain kinds of economic experiments.
And so, since the best way to see how people go wrong
is to actually do it yourself,
I'm going to give you guys a quick experiment
to sort of watch your own financial intuitions in action.
I handed each and every one of you
a thousand U.S. dollars -- so 10 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Take these, put it in your wallet
and spend a second thinking about what you're going to do with it.
Because it's yours now; you can buy whatever you want.
Donate it, take it, and so on.
Sounds great, but you get one more choice to earn a little bit more money.
And here's your choice: you can either be risky,
in which case I'm going to flip one of these monkey tokens.
If it comes up heads, you're going to get a thousand dollars more.
If it comes up tails, you get nothing.
So it's a chance to get more, but it's pretty risky.
Your other option is a bit safe. Your just going to get some money for sure.
I'm just going to give you 500 bucks.
You can stick it in your wallet and use it immediately.
So see what your intuition is here.
Most people actually go with the play-it-safe option.
Most people say, why should I be risky when I can get 1,500 dollars for sure?
This seems like a good bet. I'm going to go with that.
You might say, eh, that's not really irrational.
People are a little risk-averse. So what?
about the same problem
set up just a little bit differently.
So now imagine that I give each and every one of you
2,000 dollars -- 20 crisp hundred dollar bills.
Now you can buy double to stuff you were going to get before.
Think about how you'd feel sticking it in your wallet.
And now imagine that I have you make another choice
But this time, it's a little bit worse.
Now, you're going to be deciding how you're going to lose money,
but you're going to get the same choice.
You can either take a risky loss --
so I'll flip a coin. If it comes up heads, you're going to actually lose a lot.
If it comes up tails, you lose nothing, you're fine, get to keep the whole thing --
or you could play it safe, which means you have to reach back into your wallet
and give me five of those $100 bills, for certain.
So maybe you're having the same intuitions
as the subjects that were actually tested in this,
which is when presented with these options,
people don't choose to play it safe.
They actually tend to go a little risky.
The reason this is irrational is that we've given people in both situations
the same choice.
It's a 50/50 shot of a thousand or 2,000,
or just 1,500 dollars with certainty.
But people's intuitions about how much risk to take
varies depending on where they started with.
Well, it turns out that this seems to be the result
of at least two biases that we have at the psychological level.
One is that we have a really hard time thinking in absolute terms.
one is 1,500.
Instead, we find it very easy to think in very relative terms
as options change from one time to another.
So we think of things as, "Oh, I'm going to get more," or "Oh, I'm going to get less."
This is all well and good, except that
changes in different directions
actually effect whether or not we think
options are good or not.
And this leads to the second bias,
which economists have called loss aversion.
We really hate it when we have to lose out on some money.
And this means that sometimes we'll actually
switch our preferences to avoid this.
What you saw in that last scenario is that
subjects get risky
because they want the small shot that there won't be any loss.
That means when we're in a risk mindset --
excuse me, when we're in a loss mindset,
we actually become more risky,
which can actually be really worrying.
These kinds of things play out in lots of bad ways in humans.
They're why stock investors hold onto losing stocks longer --
because they're evaluating them in relative terms.
They're why people in the housing market refused to sell their house --
because they don't want to sell at a loss.
is whether the monkeys show the same biases.
If we set up those same scenarios in our little monkey market,
would they do the same thing as people?
And so this is what we did, we gave the monkeys choices
between guys who were safe -- they did the same thing every time --
or guys who were risky --
they did things differently half the time.
And then we gave them options that were bonuses --
like you guys did in the first scenario --
so they actually have a chance more,
or pieces where they were experiencing losses --
they actually thought they were going to get more than they really got.
We introduced the monkeys to two new monkey salesmen.
The guy on the left and right both start with one piece of grape,
so it looks pretty good.
But they're going to give the monkeys bonuses.
The guy on the left is a safe bonus.
All the time, he adds one, to give the monkeys two.
The guy on the right is actually a risky bonus.
Sometimes the monkeys get no bonus -- so this is a bonus of zero.
For a big bonus, now they get three.
But this is the same choice you guys just faced.
Do the monkeys actually want to play it safe
and then go with the guy who's going to do the same thing on every trial,
or do they want to be risky
and try to get a risky, but big, bonus,
but risk the possibility of getting no bonus.
People here played it safe.
Turns out, the monkeys play it safe too.
Qualitatively and quantitatively,
they choose exactly the same way as people,
when tested in the same thing.
Maybe we should see how they do with losses.
And so we ran a second version of this.
Now, the monkeys meet two guys
who aren't giving them bonuses;
they're actually giving them less than they expect.
So they look like they're starting out with a big amount.
These are three grapes; the monkey's really psyched for this.
But now they learn these guys are going to give them less than they expect.
They guy on the left is a safe loss.
Every single time, he's going to take one of these away
and give the monkeys just two.
the guy on the right is the risky loss.
Sometimes he gives no loss, so the monkeys are really psyched,
but sometimes he actually gives a big loss,
taking away two to give the monkeys only one.
Again, same choice; they can play it safe
for always getting two grapes every single time,
or they can take a risky bet and choose between one and three.
The remarkable thing to us is that, when you give monkeys this choice,
they do the same irrational thing that people do.
They actually become more risky
depending on how the experimenters started.
This is crazy because it suggests that the monkeys too
are evaluating things in relative terms
and actually treating losses differently than they treat gains.
Well, what we've shown is that, first of all,
we can actually give the monkeys a financial currency,
and they do very similar things with it.
They do some of the smart things we do,
some of the kind of not so nice things we do,
like steal it and so on.
But they also do some of the irrational things we do.
They systematically get things wrong
and in the same ways that we do.
This is the first take-home message of the Talk,
which is that if you saw the beginning of this and you thought,
oh, I'm totally going to go home and hire a capuchin monkey financial adviser.
They're way cuter than the one at ... you know --
Don't do that; they're probably going to be just as dumb
as the human one you already have.
So, you know, a little bad -- Sorry, sorry, sorry.
A little bad for monkey investors.
Because we've answered the question we started out with.
We wanted to know where these kinds of errors came from.
And we started with the hope that maybe we can
sort of tweak our financial institutions,
tweak our technologies to make ourselves better.
But what we've learn is that these biases might be a deeper part of us than that.
In fact, they might be due to the very nature
of our evolutionary history.
You know, maybe it's not just humans
at the right side of this chain that's duncey.
Maybe it's sort of duncey all the way back.
And this, if we believe the capuchin monkey results,
means that these duncey strategies
might be 35 million years old.
That's a long time for a strategy
to potentially get changed around -- really, really old.
Well, one thing we know is that they tend to be really hard to overcome.
You know, think of our evolutionary predilection
for eating sweet things, fatty things like cheesecake.
You can't just shut that off.
You can't just look at the dessert cart as say, "No, no, no. That looks disgusting to me."
We're just built differently.
We're going to perceive it as a good thing to go after.
My guess is that the same thing is going to be true
when humans are perceiving
different financial decisions.
When you're watching your stocks plummet into the red,
when you're watching your house price go down,
you're not going to be able to see that
in anything but old evolutionary terms.
This means that the biases
that lead investors to do badly,
that lead to the foreclosure crisis
are going to be really hard to overcome.
I'm supposed to be up here telling you the good news.
Well, the good news, I think,
is what I started with at the beginning of the Talk,
which is that humans are not only smart;
we're really inspirationally smart
to the rest of the animals in the biological kingdom.
We're so good at overcoming our biological limitations --
you know, I flew over here in an airplane.
I didn't have to try to flap my wings.
I'm wearing contact lenses now so that I can see all of you.
I don't have to rely on my own near-sightedness.
We actually have all of these cases
where we overcome our biological limitations
through technology and other means, seemingly pretty easily.
But we have to recognize that we have those limitations.
It was Camus who once said that, "Man is the only species
who refuses to be what he really is."
But the irony is that
it might only be in recognizing our limitations
that we can really actually overcome them.
The hope is that you all will think about your limitations,
not necessarily as unovercomable,
but to recognize them, accept them
and then use the world of design to actually figure them out.
That might be the only way that we will really be able
to achieve our own human potential
and really be the noble species we hope to all be.
Today, I'm going to take you
around the world in 18 minutes.
My base of operations is in the U.S.,
but let's start at the other end of the map,
in Kyoto, Japan,
where I was living with a Japanese family
while I was doing part of my dissertational research
15 years ago.
I knew even then that I would encounter
cultural differences and misunderstandings,
but they popped up when I least expected it.
I went to a restaurant,
and I ordered a cup of green tea with sugar.
After a pause, the waiter said,
"One does not put sugar in green tea."
"I know," I said. "I'm aware of this custom.
But I really like my tea sweet."
In response, he gave me an even more courteous version
of the same explanation.
"One does not put sugar
in green tea."
"I understand," I said,
"that the Japanese do not put sugar in their green tea,
but I'd like to put some sugar
in my green tea."
(Laughter)
Surprised by my insistence,
the waiter took up the issue with the manager.
Pretty soon,
a lengthy discussion ensued,
and finally the manager came over to me and said,
"I am very sorry. We do not have sugar."
(Laughter)
Well, since I couldn't have my tea the way I wanted it,
I ordered a cup of coffee,
which the waiter brought over promptly.
Resting on the saucer
were two packets of sugar.
a cup of sweet, green tea
was not due to a simple misunderstanding.
This was due to a fundamental difference
in our ideas about choice.
From my American perspective,
when a paying customer makes a reasonable request
based on her preferences,
she has every right to have that request met.
The American way, to quote Burger King,
is to "have it your way,"
because, as Starbucks says,
"happiness is in your choices."
(Laughter)
But from the Japanese perspective,
it's their duty to protect those who don't know any better --
(Laughter)
in this case, the ignorant gaijin --
from making the wrong choice.
Let's face it: the way I wanted my tea
was inappropriate according to cultural standards,
and they were doing their best to help me save face.
that they've reached some sort of pinnacle
in the way they practice choice.
They think that choice, as seen through the American lens
best fulfills an innate and universal
desire for choice in all humans.
Unfortunately,
these beliefs are based on assumptions
that don't always hold true
in many countries, in many cultures.
At times they don't even hold true
at America's own borders.
I'd like to discuss some of these assumptions
and the problems associated with them.
As I do so, I hope you'll start thinking
about some of your own assumptions
and how they were shaped by your backgrounds.
if a choice affects you,
then you should be the one to make it.
This is the only way to ensure
that your preferences and interests
will be most fully accounted for.
It is essential for success.
In America, the primary locus of choice
is the individual.
People must choose for themselves, sometimes sticking to their guns,
regardless of what other people want or recommend.
It's called "being true to yourself."
But do all individuals benefit
from taking such an approach to choice?
Mark Lepper and I did a series of studies
in which we sought the answer to this very question.
In one study,
which we ran in Japantown, San Francisco,
we brought seven- to nine-year-old Anglo- and Asian-American children
into the laboratory,
and we divided them up into three groups.
and they were greeted by Miss Smith,
who showed them six big piles of anagram puzzles.
The kids got to choose which pile of anagrams they would like to do,
and they even got to choose which marker
they would write their answers with.
When the second group of children came in,
they were brought to the same room, shown the same anagrams,
but this time Miss Smith told them
which anagrams to do
and which markers to write their answers with.
Now when the third group came in,
they were told that their anagrams and their markers
had been chosen by their mothers.
(Laughter)
In reality,
the kids who were told what to do,
whether by Miss Smith or their mothers,
were actually given the very same activity,
which their counterparts in the first group
had freely chosen.
that the kids across the three groups
all did the same activity,
making it easier for us to compare performance.
Such small differences in the way we administered the activity
yielded striking differences
in how well they performed.
Anglo-Americans,
they did two and a half times more anagrams
when they got to choose them,
as compared to when it was
chosen for them by Miss Smith or their mothers.
It didn't matter who did the choosing,
if the task was dictated by another,
their performance suffered.
In fact, some of the kids were visibly embarrassed
when they were told that their mothers had been consulted.
(Laughter)
One girl named Mary said,
"You asked my mother?"
Asian-American children
performed best when they believed
their mothers had made the choice,
second best when they chose for themselves,
and least well when it had been chosen by Miss Smith.
A girl named Natsumi
even approached Miss Smith as she was leaving the room
and tugged on her skirt and asked,
"Could you please tell my mommy
I did it just like she said?"
The first-generation children were strongly influenced
by their immigrant parents'
approach to choice.
For them, choice was not just a way
of defining and asserting
their individuality,
but a way to create community and harmony
by deferring to the choices
of people whom they trusted and respected.
If they had a concept of being true to one's self,
then that self, most likely,
[was] composed, not of an individual,
but of a collective.
Success was just as much about pleasing key figures
as it was about satisfying
one's own preferences.
Or, you could say that
the individual's preferences were shaped
by the preferences of specific others.
when the individual self chooses
only holds
when that self
is clearly divided from others.
When, in contrast,
two or more individuals
see their choices and their outcomes
as intimately connected,
then they may amplify one another's success
by turning choosing
into a collective act.
To insist that they choose independently
might actually compromise
both their performance
and their relationships.
Yet that is exactly what
the American paradigm demands.
It leaves little room for interdependence
or an acknowledgment of individual fallibility.
It requires that everyone treat choice
as a private and self-defining act.
People that have grown up in such a paradigm
might find it motivating,
but it is a mistake to assume
that everyone thrives under the pressure
of choosing alone.
goes something like this.
The more choices you have,
the more likely you are
to make the best choice.
So bring it on, Walmart, with 100,000 different products,
and Amazon, with 27 million books
and Match.com with -- what is it? --
15 million date possibilities now.
You will surely find the perfect match.
Let's test this assumption
by heading over to Eastern Europe.
Here, I interviewed people
who were residents of formerly communist countries,
who had all faced the challenge
of transitioning to a more
democratic and capitalistic society.
One of the most interesting revelations
came not from an answer to a question,
but from a simple gesture of hospitality.
When the participants arrived for their interview,
I offered them a set of drinks:
Coke, Diet Coke, Sprite --
seven, to be exact.
which was run in Russia,
one of the participants made a comment
that really caught me off guard.
"Oh, but it doesn't matter.
It's all just soda. That's just one choice."
(Murmuring)
I was so struck by this comment that from then on,
I started to offer all the participants
those seven sodas,
and I asked them, "How many choices are these?"
Again and again,
they perceived these seven different sodas,
not as seven choices, but as one choice:
soda or no soda.
When I put out juice and water
in addition to these seven sodas,
now they perceived it as only three choices --
juice, water and soda.
Compare this to the die-hard devotion of many Americans,
not just to a particular flavor of soda,
but to a particular brand.
You know, research shows repeatedly
that we can't actually tell the difference
between Coke and Pepsi.
Of course, you and I know
that Coke is the better choice.
to more options and more ads associated with options
than anyone else in the world,
choice is just as much about who they are
as it is about what the product is.
Combine this with the assumption that more choices are always better,
and you have a group of people for whom every little difference matters
and so every choice matters.
But for Eastern Europeans,
the sudden availability of all these
consumer products on the marketplace was a deluge.
They were flooded with choice
before they could protest that they didn't know how to swim.
When asked, "What words and images
do you associate with choice?"
Grzegorz from Warsaw said,
"Ah, for me it is fear.
There are some dilemmas you see.
I am used to no choice."
Bohdan from Kiev said,
in response to how he felt about
the new consumer marketplace,
"It is too much.
We do not need everything that is there."
A sociologist from
the Warsaw Survey Agency explained,
"The older generation jumped from nothing
to choice all around them.
They were never given a chance to learn
how to react."
And Tomasz, a young Polish man said,
"I don't need twenty kinds of chewing gum.
I don't mean to say that I want no choice,
but many of these choices are quite artificial."
that are not that much different.
The value of choice
depends on our ability
to perceive differences
between the options.
Americans train their whole lives
to play "spot the difference."
They practice this from such an early age
that they've come to believe that everyone
must be born with this ability.
In fact, though all humans share
a basic need and desire for choice,
we don't all see choice in the same places
or to the same extent.
When someone can't see how one choice
is unlike another,
or when there are too many choices to compare and contrast,
the process of choosing can be
confusing and frustrating.
Instead of making better choices,
we become overwhelmed by choice,
sometimes even afraid of it.
Choice no longer offers opportunities,
but imposes constraints.
It's not a marker of liberation,
but of suffocation
by meaningless minutiae.
In other words,
choice can develop into the very opposite
of everything it represents
in America
when it is thrust upon those
who are insufficiently prepared for it.
But it is not only other people
in other places
that are feeling the pressure
of ever-increasing choice.
Americans themselves are discovering
that unlimited choice
seems more attractive in theory
than in practice.
and emotional (Laughter) limitations
that make it impossible for us
to process every single choice we encounter,
even in the grocery store,
let alone over the course of our entire lives.
A number of my studies have shown
that when you give people 10 or more options
when they're making a choice, they make poorer decisions,
whether it be health care, investment,
other critical areas.
Yet still, many of us believe
that we should make all our own choices
and seek out even more of them.
and perhaps most problematic, assumption:
"You must never
say no to choice."
To examine this, let's go back to the U.S.
and then hop across the pond to France.
Right outside Chicago,
a young couple, Susan and Daniel Mitchell,
were about to have their first baby.
They'd already picked out a name for her,
Barbara, after her grandmother.
One night, when Susan was seven months pregnant,
she started to experience contractions
and was rushed to the emergency room.
The baby was delivered through a C-section,
but Barbara suffered cerebral anoxia,
a loss of oxygen to the brain.
Unable to breathe on her own,
she was put on a ventilator.
Two days later,
the doctors gave the Mitchells
a choice:
They could either remove Barbara
off the life support,
in which case she would die within a matter of hours,
or they could keep her on life support,
in which case she might still die
within a matter of days.
If she survived, she would remain
in a permanent vegetative state,
never able to walk, talk
or interact with others.
What do they do?
What do any parent do?
with Simona Botti and Kristina Orfali,
American and French parents
were interviewed.
They had all suffered
the same tragedy.
In all cases, the life support was removed,
and the infants had died.
But there was a big difference.
In France, the doctors decided whether and when
the life support would be removed,
while in the United States,
the final decision rested with the parents.
We wondered:
does this have an effect on how the parents
cope with the loss of their loved one?
We found that it did.
Even up to a year later,
American parents
were more likely to express negative emotions,
as compared to their French counterparts.
French parents were more likely to say things like,
"Noah was here for so little time,
but he taught us so much.
He gave us a new perspective on life."
"What if? What if?"
Another parent complained,
"I feel as if they purposefully tortured me.
How did they get me to do that?"
And another parent said,
"I feel as if I've played a role
in an execution."
But when the American parents were asked
if they would rather have had
the doctors make the decision,
they all said, "No."
They could not imagine
turning that choice over to another,
even though having made that choice
made them feel trapped,
guilty, angry.
In a number of cases
they were even clinically depressed.
These parents could not contemplate
giving up the choice,
because to do so would have gone contrary
to everything they had been taught
and everything they had come to believe
about the power
and purpose of choice.
Joan Didion writes,
"We tell ourselves stories
in order to live.
We interpret what we see,
select the most workable
of the multiple choices.
We live entirely by the imposition
of a narrative line
upon disparate images,
by the idea with which we have learned to freeze
the shifting phantasmagoria,
which is our actual experience."
The story Americans tell,
the story upon which
the American dream depends,
is the story of limitless choice.
This narrative
promises so much:
freedom, happiness,
success.
It lays the world at your feet and says,
"You can have anything, everything."
It's a great story,
and it's understandable why they would be reluctant
to revise it.
But when you take a close look,
you start to see the holes,
and you start to see that the story
can be told in many other ways.
disseminate their ideas of choice,
believing that they will be, or ought to be,
welcomed with open hearts and minds.
But the history books and the daily news tell us
it doesn't always work out that way.
The phantasmagoria,
the actual experience that we try to understand
and organize through narrative,
varies from place to place.
No single narrative serves the needs
of everyone everywhere.
Moreover, Americans themselves
could benefit from incorporating
new perspectives into their own narrative,
which has been driving their choices
for so long.
"It is poetry that is lost in translation."
This suggests that
whatever is beautiful and moving,
whatever gives us a new way to see,
cannot be communicated to those
who speak a different language.
But Joseph Brodsky said that,
"It is poetry
that is gained in translation,"
suggesting that translation
can be a creative,
transformative act.
When it comes to choice,
we have far more to gain than to lose
by engaging in the many
translations of the narratives.
Instead of replacing
one story with another,
we can learn from and revel in
the many versions that exist
and the many that have yet to be written.
No matter where we're from
and what your narrative is,
we all have a responsibility
to open ourselves up to a wider array
of what choice can do,
and what it can represent.
And this does not lead to
a paralyzing moral relativism.
Rather, it teaches us when
and how to act.
It brings us that much closer
to realizing the full potential of choice,
to inspiring the hope
and achieving the freedom
that choice promises
but doesn't always deliver.
If we learn to speak to one another,
albeit through translation,
then we can begin to see choice
in all its strangeness,
complexity
and compelling beauty.
Sheena, there is a detail about your biography
that we have not written in the program book.
But by now it's evident to everyone in this room. You're blind.
And I guess one of the questions on everybody's mind is:
How does that influence your study of choosing
because that's an activity
that for most people is associated with visual inputs
like aesthetics and color and so on?
because one of the things that's interesting about being blind
is you actually get a different vantage point
when you observe the way
sighted people make choices.
And as you just mentioned, there's lots of choices out there
that are very visual these days.
Yeah, I -- as you would expect --
get pretty frustrated by choices
like what nail polish to put on
because I have to rely on what other people suggest.
And I can't decide.
And so one time I was in a beauty salon,
and I was trying to decide between two very light shades of pink.
And one was called "Ballet Slippers."
And the other one was called "Adorable."
(Laughter)
And so I asked these two ladies,
and the one lady told me, "Well, you should definitely wear 'Ballet Slippers.'"
"Well, what does it look like?"
"Well, it's a very elegant shade of pink."
"Okay, great."
The other lady tells me to wear "Adorable."
"What does it look like?"
"It's a glamorous shade of pink."
And so I asked them, "Well, how do I tell them apart?
What's different about them?"
And they said, "Well, one is elegant, the other one's glamorous."
Okay, we got that.
And the only thing they had consensus on:
well, if I could see them, I would
clearly be able to tell them apart.
by the name or the content of the color,
so I decided to do a little experiment.
So I brought these two bottles of nail polish into the laboratory,
and I stripped the labels off.
And I brought women into the laboratory,
and I asked them, "Which one would you pick?"
50 percent of the women accused me of playing a trick,
of putting the same color nail polish
in both those bottles.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
At which point you start to wonder who the trick's really played on.
Now, of the women that could tell them apart,
when the labels were off, they picked "Adorable,"
and when the labels were on,
they picked "Ballet Slippers."
So as far as I can tell,
a rose by any other name
probably does look different
and maybe even smells different.
So let me just start with my story.
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage
playing soccer in college.
Then I went on to tear my ACL, the ligament in my knee,
and then developed an arthritic knee.
And I'm sure that many of you in this audience have that same story,
and, by the way, I married a woman
who has exactly the same story.
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon
and to see if I couldn't focus on solutions for those problems
that would keep me playing sports and not limit me.
So with that, let me just show you a quick video
to get you in the mood of what we're trying to explain.
but there's another disease
that's destined to affect even more of us: arthritis.
Cancer may kill you, but when you look at the numbers,
arthritis ruins more lives.
Assuming you live a long life, there's a 50 percent chance
you'll develop arthritis.
And it's not just aging that causes arthritis.
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain,
until our joints quite literally grind to a halt.
Desperate for a solution, we've turned to engineering
to design artificial components
to replace our worn-out body parts,
but in the midst of the modern buzz
around the promises of a bionic body,
shouldn't we stop and ask if there's a better, more natural way?
Let's consider an alternative path.
What if all the replacements our bodies need
already exist in nature,
or within our own stem cells?
This is the field of biologic replacements,
where we replace worn-out parts with new, natural ones.
how do I treat these things biologically?
And let's talk about both what I did for my wife,
and what I've done for hundreds of other patients.
First thing for my wife,
and the most common thing I hear from my patients,
particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group, 70-year-old age group,
is they come in and say,
"Hey, Doc, isn't there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee?
I'm not ready for joint replacement."
And so for her, I put in a human meniscus allograft donor
right into that [knee] joint space.
And [the allograft] replaces [the missing meniscus].
And then for that unstable ligament,
we put in a human donor ligament
to stabilize the knee.
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface,
we did a stem cell paste graft,
which we designed in 1991,
to regrow that articular cartilage surface
and give it back a smooth surface there.
So here's my wife's bad knee on the left,
and her just hiking now
four months later in Aspen, and doing well.
And it works, not just for my wife, but certainly for other patients.
The girl on the video, Jen Hudak,
just won the Superpipe in Aspen
just nine months after having destroyed her knee,
as you see in the other image --
and having a paste graft to that knee.
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically.
why isn't that good enough, you might ask.
Well the reason is because there's not enough donor cycles.
There's not enough young, healthy people
falling off their motorcycle
and donating that tissue to us.
And the tissue's very expensive.
And so that's not going to be a solution
that's going to get us global with biologic tissue.
But the solution is animal tissue
because it's plentiful, it's cheap,
you can get it from young, healthy tissues,
but the barrier is immunology.
And the specific barrier
is a specific epitope
called the galactosyl, or gal epitope.
So if we're going to transplant animal tissues to people,
we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope.
starts in 1984.
And I started first
with cow Achilles tendon,
where we would take the cow Achilles tendon,
which is type-I collagen,
strip it of its antigens
by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash
and forming it into a regeneration template.
We would then take that regeneration template
and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage
to regrow that in a patient's knee.
We've now done that procedure,
and it's been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases,
so it's an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way
to regrow the meniscus.
And that's great when I can degrade the tissue.
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament?
I can't grind it up in a blender.
So in that case,
I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek --
an enzyme wash
to wash away, or strip,
those galactosyl epitopes
with a specific enzyme.
And we call that a "gal stripping" technique.
What we do is humanize the tissue.
It's by gal stripping that tissue
we humanize it (Laughter),
and then we can put it back
into a patient's knee.
And we've done that. Now we've taken pig ligament --
young, healthy, big tissue,
put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial --
and then one of our patients went on to have
three Canadian Masters Downhill championships --
on his "pig-lig," as he calls it. So we know it can work.
And there's a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending.
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement,
not just the parts?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement?
Well here's how we're going to do it.
So what we're going to do is take
an articular cartilage
from a young, healthy pig,
strip it of its antigens,
load it with your stem cells,
then put it back on to that
arthritic surface in your knee,
tack it on there, have you heal that surface
and then create a new biologic surface for your knee.
So that's our biologic approach right now.
We're going to rebuild your knee with the parts.
We're going to resurface it with a completely new surface.
There's a benefit of 400 million years
of ambulation.
We can harness those benefits.
We can use thicker, younger, better tissues
than you might have injured in your knee,
or that you might have when you're 40, 50 or 60.
We can do it as an outpatient procedure.
We can strip that tissue very economically,
and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement
to go global.
It's not hardware.
It's not software.
It's bioware.
It's version 2.0 of you.
And so with that, coming to a --
(Laughter)
coming to an operating theater near you soon, I believe.
Up until now, our communication with machines
has always been limited
to conscious and direct forms.
Whether it's something simple
like turning on the lights with a switch,
or even as complex as programming robotics,
we have always had to give a command to a machine,
or even a series of commands,
in order for it to do something for us.
Communication between people, on the other hand,
is far more complex and a lot more interesting
because we take into account
so much more than what is explicitly expressed.
We observe facial expressions, body language,
and we can intuit feelings and emotions
from our dialogue with one another.
This actually forms a large part
of our decision-making process.
Our vision is to introduce
this whole new realm of human interaction
into human-computer interaction
so that computers can understand
not only what you direct it to do,
but it can also respond
to your facial expressions
and emotional experiences.
And what better way to do this
than by interpreting the signals
naturally produced by our brain,
our center for control and experience.
but this task, as Bruno mentioned,
isn't an easy one for two main reasons:
First, the detection algorithms.
Our brain is made up of
billions of active neurons,
around 170,000 km
of combined axon length.
When these neurons interact,
the chemical reaction emits an electrical impulse,
which can be measured.
The majority of our functional brain
is distributed over
the outer surface layer of the brain,
and to increase the area that's available for mental capacity,
the brain surface is highly folded.
Now this cortical folding
presents a significant challenge
for interpreting surface electrical impulses.
Each individual's cortex
is folded differently,
very much like a fingerprint.
So even though a signal
may come from the same functional part of the brain,
by the time the structure has been folded,
its physical location
is very different between individuals,
even identical twins.
There is no longer any consistency
in the surface signals.
that unfolds the cortex,
so that we can map the signals
closer to its source,
and therefore making it capable of working across a mass population.
The second challenge
is the actual device for observing brainwaves.
EEG measurements typically involve
a hairnet with an array of sensors,
like the one that you can see here in the photo.
A technician will put the electrodes
onto the scalp
using a conductive gel or paste
and usually after a procedure of preparing the scalp
by light abrasion.
Now this is quite time consuming
and isn't the most comfortable process.
And on top of that, these systems
actually cost in the tens of thousands of dollars.
Evan Grant, who is one of last year's speakers,
who's kindly agreed
to help me to demonstrate
what we've been able to develop.
is a 14-channel, high-fidelity
EEG acquisition system.
It doesn't require any scalp preparation,
no conductive gel or paste.
It only takes a few minutes to put on
and for the signals to settle.
It's also wireless,
so it gives you the freedom to move around.
And compared to the tens of thousands of dollars
for a traditional EEG system,
this headset only costs
a few hundred dollars.
Now on to the detection algorithms.
So facial expressions --
as I mentioned before in emotional experiences --
are actually designed to work out of the box
with some sensitivity adjustments
available for personalization.
But with the limited time we have available,
I'd like to show you the cognitive suite,
which is the ability for you
to basically move virtual objects with your mind.
so what we have to do first
is create a new profile for him.
He's obviously not Joanne -- so we'll "add user."
Evan. Okay.
So the first thing we need to do with the cognitive suite
is to start with training
a neutral signal.
With neutral, there's nothing in particular
that Evan needs to do.
He just hangs out. He's relaxed.
And the idea is to establish a baseline
or normal state for his brain,
because every brain is different.
It takes eight seconds to do this,
and now that that's done,
we can choose a movement-based action.
So Evan, choose something
that you can visualize clearly in your mind.
So the idea here now
is that Evan needs to
imagine the object coming forward
into the screen,
and there's a progress bar that will scroll across the screen
while he's doing that.
The first time, nothing will happen,
because the system has no idea how he thinks about "pull."
But maintain that thought
for the entire duration of the eight seconds.
So: one, two, three, go.
Okay.
So once we accept this,
the cube is live.
So let's see if Evan
can actually try and imagine pulling.
Ah, good job!
(Applause)
That's really amazing.
so I'm going to ask Evan
to do a really difficult task.
And this one is difficult
because it's all about being able to visualize something
that doesn't exist in our physical world.
This is "disappear."
So what you want to do -- at least with movement-based actions,
we do that all the time, so you can visualize it.
But with "disappear," there's really no analogies --
so Evan, what you want to do here
is to imagine the cube slowly fading out, okay.
Same sort of drill. So: one, two, three, go.
Okay. Let's try that.
Oh, my goodness. He's just too good.
Let's try that again.
even though you can only hold it
for a little bit of time.
As I said, it's a very difficult process
to imagine this.
And the great thing about it is that
we've only given the software one instance
of how he thinks about "disappear."
As there is a machine learning algorithm in this --
Good job. Good job.
example of the technology.
there is a leveling system built into this software
so that as Evan, or any user,
becomes more familiar with the system,
they can continue to add more and more detections,
so that the system begins to differentiate
between different distinct thoughts.
And once you've trained up the detections,
these thoughts can be assigned or mapped
to any computing platform,
application or device.
because there are many possible applications
for this new interface.
In games and virtual worlds, for example,
your facial expressions
can naturally and intuitively be used
to control an avatar or virtual character.
Obviously, you can experience the fantasy of magic
and control the world with your mind.
And also, colors, lighting,
sound and effects
can dynamically respond to your emotional state
to heighten the experience that you're having, in real time.
And moving on to some applications
developed by developers and researchers around the world,
with robots and simple machines, for example --
in this case, flying a toy helicopter
simply by thinking "lift" with your mind.
to real world applications --
in this example, a smart home.
You know, from the user interface of the control system
to opening curtains
or closing curtains.
And of course, also to the lighting --
turning them on
or off.
And finally,
to real life-changing applications,
such as being able to control an electric wheelchair.
In this example,
facial expressions are mapped to the movement commands.
Now blink left to turn back left.
Now smile to go straight.
and with the community's input,
and also with the involvement of developers
and researchers from around the world,
we hope that you can help us to shape
where the technology goes from here. Thank you so much.
Well, indeed, I'm very, very lucky.
My talk essentially got written
by three historic events
that happened within days of each other
in the last two months --
seemingly unrelated, but as you will see,
actually all having to do with
the story I want to tell you today.
The first one was actually a funeral --
to be more precise, a reburial.
On May 22nd, there was a hero's reburial
in Frombork, Poland
of the 16th-century astronomer
who actually changed the world.
He did that, literally,
by replacing the Earth with the Sun
in the center of the Solar System,
and then with this simple-looking act,
he actually launched a scientific
and technological revolution,
which many call the Copernican Revolution.
Now that was,
ironically, and very befittingly,
the way we found his grave.
As it was the custom of the time,
Copernicus was actually
simply buried in an unmarked grave,
together with 14 others
in that cathedral.
DNA analysis,
one of the hallmarks
of the scientific revolution
of the last 400 years that he started,
was the way we found
which set of bones
actually belonged to the person
who read all those astronomical books
which were filled with leftover hair
that was Copernicus' hair --
obviously not many other people
bothered to read these books later on.
That match was unambiguous.
The DNA matched,
and we know that this was indeed
Nicolaus Copernicus.
biology and DNA
and life
is very tantalizing when you talk about Copernicus
because, even back then,
his followers
very quickly made the logical step
to ask: if the Earth is just a planet,
then what about planets around other stars?
What about the idea of the plurality of the worlds,
about life on other planets?
In fact, I'm borrowing here from one of those
very popular books of the time.
And at the time,
people actually answered that question
positively: "Yes."
But there was no evidence.
And here begins 400 years
of frustration, of unfulfilled dreams --
the dreams of Galileo, Giordano Bruno,
many others --
which never led to the answer
of those very basic questions
which humanity has asked all the time.
"What is life? What is the origin of life?
Are we alone?"
And that especially happened in the last 10 years,
at the end of the 20th century,
when the beautiful developments
due to molecular biology,
understanding the code of life, DNA,
all of that seemed to actually
put us, not closer,
but further apart from answering
those basic questions.
A lot has happened in the last few years,
and let's start with the planets.
Let's start with the old Copernican question:
Are there earths around other stars?
And as we already heard,
there is a way in which
we are trying, and now able,
to answer that question.
It's a new telescope.
Our team, befittingly I think,
named it after one of those dreamers
of the Copernican time,
Johannes Kepler,
and that telescope's sole purpose
is to go out,
find the planets that orbit
other stars in our galaxy,
and tell us how often do planets like our own Earth
happen to be out there.
The telescope is actually
built similarly to
the, well-known to you, Hubble Space Telescope,
except it does have an additional lens --
a wide-field lens,
as you would call it as a photographer.
And if, in the next couple of months,
you walk out in the early evening
and look straight up
and place you palm like this,
you will actually be looking at the field of the sky
where this telescope is searching for planets
day and night, without any interruption,
for the next four years.
is with a method, which we call the transit method.
It's actually mini-eclipses that occur
when a planet passes in front of its star.
Not all of the planets will be fortuitously oriented
for us to be able do that,
but if you have a million stars,
you'll find enough planets.
And as you see on this animation,
what Kepler is going to detect
is just the dimming of the light from the star.
We are not going to see the image of the star and the planet as this.
All the stars for Kepler are just points of light.
But we learn a lot from that:
not only that there is a planet there, but we also learn its size.
How much of the light is being dimmed
depends on how big the planet is.
We learn about its orbit,
the period of its orbit and so on.
So, what have we learned?
Well, let me try to walk you through
what we actually see
and so you understand the news
that I'm here to tell you today.
is discover a lot of candidates,
which we then follow up and find as planets,
confirm as planets.
It basically tells us
this is the distribution of planets in size.
There are small planets, there are bigger planets, there are big planets, okay.
So we count many, many such planets,
and they have different sizes.
We do that in our solar system.
In fact, even back during the ancients,
the Solar System in that sense
would look on a diagram like this.
There will be the smaller planets, and there will be the big planets,
even back to the time of Epicurus
and then of course Copernicus
and his followers.
Up until recently, that was the Solar System --
four Earth-like planets with small radius,
smaller than about two times the size of the Earth --
and that was of course Mercury,
Venus, Mars,
and of course the Earth,
and then the two big, giant planets.
Then the Copernican Revolution
brought in telescopes,
and of course three more planets were discovered.
Now the total planet number
in our solar system was nine.
The small planets dominated,
and there was a certain harmony to that,
which actually Copernicus was very happy to note,
and Kepler was one of the big proponents of.
So now we have Pluto to join the numbers of small planets.
But up until, literally, 15 years ago,
that was all we knew about planets.
And that's what the frustration was.
The Copernican dream was unfulfilled.
the technology came to the point
where we could discover a planet around another star,
and we actually did pretty well.
In the next 15 years,
almost 500 planets
were discovered orbiting other stars, with different methods.
Unfortunately, as you can see,
there was a very different picture.
There was of course an explanation for it:
We only see the big planets,
so that's why most of those planets
are really in the category of "like Jupiter."
But you see, we haven't gone very far.
We were still back where Copernicus was.
We didn't have any evidence
whether planets like the Earth are out there.
And we do care about planets like the Earth
because by now we understood
that life as a chemical system
really needs a smaller planet
with water and with rocks
and with a lot of complex chemistry
to originate, to emerge, to survive.
And we didn't have the evidence for that.
of what the new telescope, Kepler,
has been able to tell us in the last few weeks,
and, lo and behold,
we are back to the harmony
and to fulfilling the dreams of Copernicus.
You can see here,
the small planets dominate the picture.
The planets which are marked "like Earth,"
[are] definitely more than
any other planets that we see.
And now for the first time, we can say that.
There is a lot more work we need to do with this.
Most of these are candidates.
In the next few years we will confirm them.
But the statistical result
is loud and clear.
And the statistical result is that
planets like our own Earth
are out there.
Our own Milky Way Galaxy is rich in this kind of planets.
Well, first of all, we can study them
now that we know where they are.
And we can find those that we would call habitable,
meaning that they have similar conditions
to the conditions
that we experience here on Earth
and where a lot of complex chemistry can happen.
So, we can even put a number
to how many of those planets
now do we expect our own
Milky Way Galaxy harbors.
And the number, as you might expect,
is pretty staggering.
It's about 100 million such planets.
That's great news. Why?
Because with our own little telescope,
just in the next two years,
we'll be able to identify at least 60 of them.
So that's great because then
we can go and study them --
remotely, of course --
with all the techniques that we already have
tested in the past five years.
We can find what they're made of,
would their atmospheres have water, carbon dioxide, methane.
We know and expect that we'll see that.
That's not why I'm here.
Why I'm here is to tell you that the next step
is really the exciting part.
The one that this step
is enabling us to do is coming next.
And here comes biology --
biology, with its basic question,
which still stands unanswered,
which is essentially:
"If there is life on other planets,
do we expect it to be like life on Earth?"
And let me immediately tell you here,
when I say life, I don't mean "dolce vita,"
good life, human life.
I really mean life
on Earth, past and present,
from microbes to us humans,
in its rich molecular diversity,
the way we now understand life on Earth
as being a set of molecules and chemical reactions --
and we call that, collectively, biochemistry,
life as a chemical process,
as a chemical phenomenon.
is that chemical phenomenon universal,
or is it something
which depends on the planet?
Is it like gravity,
which is the same everywhere in the universe,
or there would be all kinds of different biochemistries
wherever we find them?
We need to know what we are looking for
when we try to do that.
And that's a very basic question, which we don't know the answer to,
but which we can try --
and we are trying -- to answer in the lab.
We don't need to go to space
to answer that question.
And so, that's what we are trying to do.
And that's what many people now are trying to do.
And a lot of the good news comes from that part of the bridge
that we are trying to build as well.
that I want to show you here.
When we think of what is necessary
for the phenomenon that we call life,
we think of compartmentalization,
keeping the molecules which are important for life
in a membrane,
isolated from the rest of the environment,
but yet, in an environment in which
they actually could originate together.
And in one of our labs,
Jack Szostak's labs,
it was a series of experiments
in the last four years
that showed that the environments --
which are very common on planets,
on certain types of planets like the Earth,
where you have some liquid water and some clays --
you actually end up with
naturally available molecules
which spontaneously form bubbles.
But those bubbles have membranes
very similar to the membrane of every cell
of every living thing on Earth looks like,
like this.
And they really help molecules,
like nucleic acids, like RNA and DNA,
stay inside, develop,
change, divide
and do some of the processes that we call life.
to tell you the pathway
in which we are trying to answer
that bigger question about the universality of the phenomenon.
And in a sense, you can think of that work
that people are starting to do now around the world
as building a bridge,
building a bridge from two sides of the river.
On one hand, on the left bank of the river,
are the people like me who study those planets
and try to define the environments.
We don't want to go blind because there's too many possibilities,
and there is not too much lab,
and there is not enough human time
to actually to do all the experiments.
So that's what we are building from the left side of the river.
From the right bank of the river
are the experiments in the lab that I just showed you,
where we actually tried that, and it feeds back and forth,
and we hope to meet in the middle one day.
Why am I trying to sell you
a half-built bridge?
Am I that charming?
Well, there are many reasons,
and you heard some of them
in the short talk today.
This understanding of chemistry
actually can help us
with our daily lives.
But there is something more profound here,
something deeper.
And that deeper, underlying point
is that science
is in the process of redefining life
as we know it.
And that is going to change
our worldview in a profound way --
not in a dissimilar way
as 400 years ago,
Copernicus' act did,
by changing the way
we view space and time.
Now it's about something else,
but it's equally profound.
And half the time,
what's happened
is it's related this kind of
sense of insignificance
to humankind,
to the Earth in a bigger space.
And the more we learn,
the more that was reinforced.
You've all learned that in school --
how small the Earth is
compared to the immense universe.
And the bigger the telescope,
the bigger that universe becomes.
And look at this image of the tiny, blue dot.
This pixel is the Earth.
It is the Earth as we know it.
It is seen from, in this case,
from outside the orbit of Saturn.
But it's really tiny.
We know that.
Let's think of life as that entire planet
because, in a sense, it is.
The biosphere is the size of the Earth.
Life on Earth
is the size of the Earth.
And let's compare it to the rest of the world
in spatial terms.
What if that
Copernican insignificance
was actually all wrong?
Would that make us more responsible
for what is happening today?
Let's actually try that.
Can you imagine how small it is?
Let me try it.
Okay, let's say
this is the size
of the observable universe,
with all the galaxies,
with all the stars,
okay, from here to here.
Do you know what the size of life
in this necktie will be?
It will be the size
of a single, small atom.
It is unimaginably small.
We can't imagine it.
I mean look, you can see the necktie,
but you can't even imagine seeing
the size of a little, small atom.
But that's not the whole story, you see.
The universe and life
are both in space and time.
If that was
the age of the universe,
then this is the age of life on Earth.
Think about those oldest living things on Earth,
but in a cosmic proportion.
This is not insignificant.
This is very significant.
So life might be insignificant in size,
but it is not insignificant in time.
Life and the universe
compare to each other like a child and a parent,
parent and offspring.
This tells us that
that insignificance paradigm
that we somehow got to learn
from the Copernican principle,
it's all wrong.
There is immense, powerful potential
in life in this universe --
especially now that we know
that places like the Earth are common.
And that potential, that powerful potential,
is also our potential,
of you and me.
And if we are to be stewards
of our planet Earth
and its biosphere,
we'd better understand
the cosmic significance
and do something about it.
And the good news is we can
actually, indeed do it.
And let's do it.
Let's start this new revolution
at the tail end of the old one,
with synthetic biology being
the way to transform
both our environment
and our future.
And let's hope that we can build this bridge together
and meet in the middle.
In October 2010,
the Justice League of America will be teaming up with The 99.
Icons like Batman,
Superman, Wonder Woman and their colleagues
will be teaming up with icons Jabbar, Noora,
Jami and their colleagues.
It's a story of intercultural intersections,
and what better group
to have this conversation
than those that grew out of fighting fascism
an unlikely reaction came out of North America.
also going back to the Bible.
like the prophets, all the superheroes
are missing parents.
Bruce Wayne, who becomes Batman,
loses his parents at the age of six in Gotham City.
Spiderman is raised
by his aunt and uncle.
And all of them, just like the prophets who get their message
from God through Gabriel,
get their message from above.
Peter Parker is in a library in Manhattan
when the spider descends from above
and gives him his message through a bite.
Bruce Wayne is in his bedroom
when a big bat flies over his head,
and he sees it as an omen to become Batman.
Superman is not only sent to Earth
from the heavens, or Krypton,
but he's sent in a pod, much like Moses was on the Nile.
(Laughter)
And you hear the voice of his father, Jor-El,
saying to Earth, "I have sent to you my only son."
and the thinking behind that was to create
positive, globally-resonating storylines
that could be tied to the same things
that other people were pulling mean messages out of
because then the person that's using religion for the wrong purpose
just becomes a bad man with a bad message.
And it's only by linking positive things
that the negative can be delinked.
This is the kind of thinking that went into
creating The 99.
The 99 references the 99 attributes of Allah in the Koran,
things like generosity and mercy and foresight and wisdom
and dozens of others that no two people in the world would disagree about.
It doesn't matter what your religion is;
even if you're an atheist, you don't raise your kid telling him, you know,
"Make sure you lie three times a day."
Those are basic human values.
takes place in 1258,
which history tells us the Mongols invaded Baghdad and destroyed it.
All the books from Bait al-Hikma library,
the most famous library in its day, were thrown in the Tigris River,
and the Tigris changes color with ink.
It's a story passed on generation after generation.
I rewrote that story,
if you want a comic book to do well, make the librarians the hero. It always works well.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
So the librarians find out
would be able to save all that culture and history in the books.
But the Mongols get there first.
The books and the solution get thrown in the Tigris River.
Some librarians escape, and over the course of days and weeks,
they dip the stones into the Tigris and suck up that collective wisdom
that we all think is lost to civilization.
of 33 stones each
through Arabia into Andalusia in Spain, where they're safe for 200 years.
But in 1492, two important things happen.
The first is the fall of Granada,
the last Muslim enclave in Europe.
The second is Columbus finally gets funded to go to India, but he gets lost.
(Laughter)
So 33 of the stones are smuggled
onto the Nina, the Pinta and the Santa Maria
and are spread in the New World.
Thirty-three go on the Silk Road to China, South Asia and Southeast Asia.
And 33 are spread between Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
from 99 different countries.
Now it's very easy to assume
his name was al-Ma'mun -- he was Harun al-Rashid's son.
He had told his advisers, "Get me all the scholars
to translate any book they can get their hands onto into Arabic,
and I will pay them its weight in gold."
After a while, his advisers complained.
They said, "Your Highness, the scholars are cheating.
They're writing in big handwriting to take more gold."
To which he said, "Let them be, because what they're giving us
is worth a lot more than what we're paying them."
So the idea of an open architecture, an open knowledge,
is not new to my neck of the desert.
Noor is Arabic for light.
So these 99 stones, a few kind of rules in the game:
Number one, you don't choose the stone; the stone chooses you.
There's a King Arthur element to the storyline, okay.
Number two, all of The 99,
when they first get their stone, or their power, abuse it;
they use it for self-interest.
And there's a very strong message in there that when you start abusing your stone,
you get taken advantage of
by people who will exploit your powers, okay.
Number three, the 99 stones all have within them
a mechanism that self-updates.
Everybody believes the Koran is for all time and all place.
Some believe that means that the original interpretation
from a couple thousand years ago is what's relevant today.
I don't belong there.
Then there's a group that believes the Koran is a living, breathing document,
and I captured that idea within these stones that self-update.
Now the main bad guy, Rughal,
does not want these stones to update,
so he's trying to get them to stop updating.
He can't use the stones, but he can stop them.
And by stopping them, he has more of a fascist agenda,
where he gets some of The 99 to work for him --
they're all wearing cookie-cutter, same color uniforms
They're not allowed to individually express who they are and what they are.
And he controls them from the top down --
whereas when they work for the other side, eventually,
when they find out this is the wrong person, they've been manipulated,
they actually, each one has a different, colorful
kind of dress.
So The 99 work in teams of three.
Why three? A couple of reasons.
Number one, we have a thing within Islam that you don't leave a boy and a girl alone together,
because the third person is temptation or the devil, right?
I think that's there in all cultures, right?
But this is not about religion, it's not about proselytizing.
There's this very strong social message
that needs to get to kind of
the deepest crevices of intolerance,
and the only way to get there is to kind of play the game.
And so this is the way I dealt with it.
They work in teams of three: two boys and a girl, two girls and a boy,
three boys, three girls, no problem.
And the Swiss psychoanalyst, Carl Jung, also spoke about
the importance of the number three in all cultures, so I figure I'm covered.
Well ...
I got accused in a few blogs that I was actually sent by the Pope
to preach the Trinity and Catholicism in the Middle East,
so you -- (Laughter)
you believe who you want. I gave you my version of the story.
Mujiba, from Malaysia: her main power is she's able to answer any question.
She's the Trivial Pursuit queen, if you want,
but when she first gets her power,
she starts going on game shows and making money.
We have Jabbar from Saudi who starts breaking things when he has the power.
Now, Mumita was a fun one to name. Mumita is the destroyer.
So the 99 attributes of Allah have the yin and the yang;
there's the powerful, the hegemonous, the strong,
and there's also the kind, the generous.
I'm like, are all the girls going to be kind and merciful and the guys all strong?
I'm like, you know what, I've met a few girls who were destroyers in my lifetime, so ...
(Laughter)
Musawwira from Ghana,
Hadya from Pakistan, Jaleel from Iran who uses fire.
And this is one of my favorites, Al-Batina from Yemen.
Al-Batina is the hidden.
So Al-Batina is hidden, but she's a superhero.
I came home to my wife and I said, "I created a character after you."
My wife is a Saudi from Yemeni roots.
And she said, "Show me." So I showed this.
She said, "That's not me."
I said, "Look at the eyes. They're your eyes."
This was going to be Superman, or it wasn't worth my time or their money.
So from day one, the people involved in the project,
bottom left is Fabian Nicieza,
writer for X-Men and Power Rangers.
Next to him is Dan Panosian,
one of the character creators for the modern-day X-Men.
Top right is Stuart Moore, a writer for Iron Man.
Next to him is John McCrea, who was an inker for Spiderman.
And we entered Western consciousness
with a tagline: "Next Ramadan, the world will have new heroes,"
back in 2005.
and I was waiting by the coffee for the right journalist.
Didn't have a product, but had energy.
And I found somebody from The New York Times,
and I cornered him, and I pitched him.
And I think I scared him -- (Laughter)
because he basically promised me --
we had no product -- but he said, "We'll give you a paragraph in the arts section
if you'll just go away."
(Laughter)
So I said, "Great." So I called him up a few weeks afterward.
I said, "Hi, Hesa." And he said, "Hi." I said, "Happy New Year."
He said, "Thank you. We had a baby." I said, "Congratulations."
Like I care, right?
"So when's the article coming out?"
He said, "Naif, Islam and cartoon?
That's not timely.
You know, maybe next week, next month, next year, but, you know, it'll come out."
So a few days after that, what happens?
What happens is the world erupts in the Danish cartoon controversy.
I became timely.
(Laughter)
So flurry of phone calls and emails from The New York Times.
Next thing you knew, there's a full page covering us positively,
January 22nd, 2006,
which changed our lives forever,
because anybody Googling Islam and cartoon or Islam and comic,
guess what they got; they got me.
kind of flying out of what was happening around the world.
And that led to all kinds of things,
from being in curricula in universities and schools to --
one of my favorite pictures I have from South Asia,
it was a couple of men with long beards
and a lot of girls wearing the hijab -- it looked like a school.
The good news is they're all holding copies of The 99, smiling,
and they found me to sign the picture.
The bad news is they were all photocopies, so we didn't make a dime in revenue.
(Laughter)
We've been able to license The 99 comic books
into eight languages so far --
Chinese, Indonesian, Hindi, Urdu, Turkish.
Opened a theme park through a license in Kuwait a year and a half ago
called The 99 Village Theme Park --
300,000 square feet, 20 rides, all with our characters:
a couple back-to-school licenses in Spain and Turkey.
is that we've done a 26-episode animated series,
which is done for global audiences:
in fact, we're already going to be in the U.S. and Turkey, we know.
It's 3D CGI, which is going to be very high-quality,
written in Hollywood by the writers behind Ben 10
and Spiderman and Star Wars: Clone Wars.
In this clip I'm about to show you, which has never been seen in the public before,
there is a struggle.
Two of the characters, Jabbar, the one with the muscles,
and Noora, the one that can use light,
are actually wearing the cookie-cutter fascist gray uniform
because they're being manipulated.
They don't know, OK,
and they're trying to get another member of The 99 to join them.
So there's a struggle within the team.
So if we can get the lights ...
I need more light.
until I know it's safe.
I can't forget auntie.
even if you don't believe in yourself right now.
I believe in you.
You are Noora the Light.
I don't deserve it. I don't deserve anything.
Don't we deserve to be saved? Don't I?
Now, tell me which way to go.
and you want to reboot the [unclear]. No more [unclear].
it's design.
But that's only half the story.
As the father of five sons,
I worry about who they're going to be using as role models.
I worry because all around me, even within my extended family,
I see religion being manipulated.
As a psychologist, I worry
for the world in general,
but worry about the perception of how people see themselves
in my part of the world.
and I heard one too many stories of people growing up
to idolize their leadership,
only to end up being tortured by their heroes.
And torture's a terrible enough thing as it is, but when it's done by your hero,
that just breaks you in so many ways.
I left Bellevue, went to business school and started this.
when I -- about the importance of this message --
is that I gave a lecture at the medical school at Kuwait University,
where I lecture on the biological basis of behavior,
and I gave the students two articles, one from The New York Times
and one from New York magazine.
And I took away the name of the writer, the name of the [unclear] -- everything was gone except the facts.
And the first one was about a group called The Party of God,
who wanted to ban Valentine's Day. Red was made illegal.
Any boys and girls caught flirting
would get married off immediately, okay.
The second one was about a woman complaining
because three minivans with six bearded men pulled up
and started interrogating her on the spot
for talking to a man who wasn't related to her.
The first one, they said Saudi Arabia. There was no debate.
The second one, they were actually split
between Saudi and Afghanistan.
What blew their mind was the first one took place in India,
it was the party of a Hindu God.
The second one took place in upstate New York.
It was an Orthodox Jewish community.
But what breaks my heart and what's alarming
is that in those two interviews,
the people around, who were interviewed as well,
refer to that behavior as Talibanization.
In other words, good Hindus and good Jews don't act this way.
This is Islam's influence on Hinduism and Judaism.
But what do the students in Kuwait say? They said it's us --
and this is dangerous.
It's dangerous when a group self-identifies itself
as extreme.
who's a Scooby Doo addict.
You can tell by the glasses there.
He actually called me a meddling kid the other day.
(Laughter)
But I borrow a lesson that I learned from him.
Last summer when we were in our home in New York,
he was out in the yard playing in his playhouse. And I was in my office working,
and he came in, "Baba, I want you to come with me. I want my toy."
"Yes, Rayan, just go away." He left his Scooby Doo in his house.
I said, "Go away. I'm working. I'm busy."
And what Rayan did then
is he sat there, he tapped his foot on the floor, at three and a half,
and he looked at me and he said, "Baba,
I want you to come with me to my office in my house.
I have work to do."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Rayan reframed the situation
and brought himself down to my level.
You know, I think that there's a big parallel
between bending the crucifix out of shape
and creating swastikas.
And when I see pictures like this, of parents or uncles
who think it's cute to have a little child
holding a Koran and having a suicide bomber belt around them
to protest something,
the hope is by linking enough positive things
to the Koran,
that one day we can move this child
from being proud in the way they're proud there,
to that.
And I think --
I think The 99
can and will achieve its mission.
and, you know, it was Middle East Day or something.
And people came up and picked up
the culturally resonant image of the falafel,
ate it and, you know, talked and left.
And no two people could disagree about what the word free was
and what the word falafel was, behind us, "free falafel." You know.
(Laughter)
Or so we thought,
until a woman came rushing across the campus
and dropped her bag on the floor, pointed up to the sign and said,
"Who's falafel?"
(Laughter)
True story.
(Laughter)
She was actually coming out of an Amnesty International meeting.
the cover of our upcoming crossover.
On that cover you see Batman, Superman
and a fully-clothed Wonder Woman
with our Saudi member of The 99,
our Emirati member and our Libyan member.
On April 26, 2010,
President Barack Obama said that
of all the initiatives since his now famous Cairo speech --
in which he reached out to the Muslim world --
the most innovative was that The 99 reach back out
to the Justice League of America.
We live in a world in which the most culturally innocuous symbols,
like the falafel, can be misunderstood because of baggage,
they'll always be a job for Superman and The 99.
The anger in me against corruption
made me to make a big career change
last year, becoming a full-time practicing lawyer.
My experiences over the last 18 months,
as a lawyer, has seeded in me
a new entrepreneurial idea,
which I believe is indeed
worth spreading.
So, I share it with all of you here today,
though the idea itself is getting crystallized
and I'm still writing up the business plan.
Of course it helps that fear of public failure
diminishes as the number of ideas
which have failed increases.
since 1993.
I've explored, experienced,
and experimented enterprise
and capitalism to my heart's content.
I built, along with my two brothers,
the leading real estate company in my home state, Kerala,
and then worked professionally
with two of India's biggest businessmen,
but in their startup enterprises.
In 2003, when I stepped out of the pure play capitalistic sector
to work on so-called social sector issues,
I definitely did not have any grand strategy
or plan to pursue and find
for-profit solutions
to addressing pressing public issues.
of death and near-death experiences
within my close circle,
which highlighted the need
for an emergency medical response service in India,
similar to 911 in USA.
To address this, I, along with four friends,
founded Ambulance Access for All,
to promote life-support ambulance services in India.
For those from the developing world,
there is nothing, absolutely nothing new in this idea.
But as we envisioned it,
we had three key goals:
Providing world-class life support ambulance service
which is fully self-sustainable from its own revenue streams,
and universally accessible
to anyone in a medical emergency,
irrespective of the capability to pay.
The service which grew out of this,
Dial 1298 for Ambulance,
with one ambulance in 2004,
now has a hundred-plus ambulances in three states,
and has transported over 100,000 patients
and victims since inception.
fully self-sustainable from its own revenues,
without accessing any public funds,
and the cross-subsidy model actually works,
where the rich pays higher, poor pays lower,
and the accident victim is getting the service free of charge.
The service responded effectively
and efficiently,
during the unfortunate
26/11 Mumbai terror attacks.
And as you can see from the visuals,
the service was responding and rescuing
victims from the incident locations
even before the police could cordon off
the incident locations
and formally confirm it as a terror strike.
We ended up being the first medical response team
in every incident location
and transported 125 victims,
saving life.
of 26/11 attacks
over the last one year,
we have actually helped a Pakistani NGO,
Aman Foundation,
to set up a self-sustainable life support ambulance service
in Karachi, facilitated by Acumen Fund.
in our own small way
to the enemies of humanity,
of Islam, of South Asia,
of India, and of Pakistan,
that humanity will continue to bloom,
irrespective of such dastardly attacks.
Since then I've also co-founded two other social enterprises.
One is Education Access for All,
setting up schools in small-town India.
And the other is Moksha-Yug Access,
which is integrating rural supply chain
on the foundations of self-help group-based microfinance.
I guess we seem to be doing at least a few things right.
Because diligent investors and venture funds
have committed over 7.5 million dollars in funding.
With the significance being these funds have come in
as a QT capital, not as grant or as philanthropy.
that I'm exploring.
Corruption, bribes, and lack of transparency.
You may be surprised to know
that eight speakers yesterday
actually mentioned these terms in their talks.
Bribes and corruption have both a demand and a supply side,
with the supply side being mostly of
greedy corporate unethical businesses
and hapless common man.
And the demand side being mostly politicians,
bureaucrats and those who have discretionary power
vested with them.
one trillion dollars is paid in bribes
every year, worsening the condition
of the already worse off.
Yet, if you analyze the common man,
he or she does not wake up every day and say,
"Hmm, let me see who I can pay a bribe to today."
or, "Let me see who I can corrupt today."
Often it is the constraining or the back-to-the-wall situation
that the hapless common man finds himself or herself in
that leads him to pay a bribe.
In the modern day world, where time is premium
and battle for subsistence is unimaginably tough,
the hapless common man
simply gives in and pays the bribe just to get on with life.
Imagine you are being asked to pay a bribe
in your day-to-day life to get something done.
What do you do? Of course you can call the police.
But what is the use if the police department is in itself steeped in corruption?
Most definitely you don't want to pay the bribe.
But you also don't have the time, resources,
expertise or wherewithal to fight this.
Unfortunately, many of us in this room
are supporters of capitalist policies and market forces.
have not yet thrown up a service where you can call in,
pay a fee, and fight the demand for a bribe.
Like a bribe buster service,
or 1-800-Fight-Bribes,
or www.stopbribes.org or
www.preventcorruption.org.
Such a service simply do not exist.
One image that has haunted me
from my early business days
is of a grandmother, 70 plus years, being harassed
by the bureaucrats in the town planning office.
All she needed was permission to build three steps
to her house, from ground level,
making it easier for her to enter and exit her house.
Yet the officer in charge would not simply give her the permit
for want of a bribe.
Even though it pricked my conscience then,
I could not, or rather I did not
tend to her or assist her,
because I was busy building my real estate company.
I don't want to be haunted by such images any more.
to address individual instances of demands
for bribes for common services or entitlement.
And in all 42 cases where we have pushed back such demands
using existing and legitimate tools
like the Right to Information Act,
video, audio, or peer pressure,
we have successfully obtained whatever our clients
set out to achieve without actually paying a bribe.
And with the cost of these tools being substantially lower
than the bribe demanded.
I believe that these tools that worked in these 42 pilot cases
can be consolidated in standard processes
in a BPO kind of environment,
and made available on web, call-center
and franchise physical offices,
for a fee, to serve anyone confronted with a demand for a bribe.
The target market is as tempting as it can get.
It can be worth up to one trillion dollars,
being paid in bribes every year,
or equal to India's GDP.
And it is an absolutely virgin market.
to examine the potential of creating
a for-profit, fee-based BPO
kind of service to stop bribes
and prevent corruption.
I do realize that the fight for justice
against corruption is never easy.
It never has been and it never will be.
In my last 18 months as a lawyer,
battling small- and large-scale corruption,
including the one perpetrated by India's biggest corporate scamster.
Through his charities
I have had three police cases filed against me
alleging trespass, impersonation and intimidation.
The battle against corruption
exacts a toll on ourselves,
our families, our friends, and even our kids.
Yet I believe the price we pay is well worth holding on
to our dignity and making the world a fairer place.
As my close friend replied, when told
during the seeding days of the ambulance project
that it is an impossible task
and the founders are insane to chalk up their blue-chip jobs,
I quote: "Of course we cannot fail in this,
at least in our own minds.
For we are insane people,
trying to do an impossible task.
And an insane person does not know what an impossible task is." Thank you.
Shaffi Mather: I just have to get through the initial days where I don't get eliminated.
I mean, give us a sense of the numbers here --
a typical bribe and a typical fee. I mean, what's in your head?
Somebody who had applied for the passport.
The officer was just sitting on it
and was demanding around 3,000 rupees in bribes.
And he did not want to pay.
So we actually used the Right to Information Act,
which is equal to the Freedom of Information Act in the United States,
and pushed back the officers in this particular case.
And in all these 42 cases,
when we kept pushing them back,
there was three kinds of reaction.
A set of people actually say,
"Oh, let me just grant it to them, and run away from it."
Some people actually come back and say,
"Oh, you want to screw me. Let me show you what I can do."
And he will push us back.
So you take the next step, or use the next tool available
in what we are putting together,
and then he relents.
By the third time, in all 42 cases, we have achieved success.
what fee would you have to charge,
and can you actually make the business work?
was less than 200 rupees.
So, it actually works.
If you can pull this off, you will be a global hero.
I mean, this could be huge.
Thank you so much for sharing this idea at TED.
Chris Anderson: Julian, welcome.
It's been reported that WikiLeaks, your baby,
has, in the last few years
has released more classified documents
than the rest of the world's media combined.
Can that possibly be true?
It's a worry -- isn't it? -- that the rest of the world's media
is doing such a bad job
that a little group of activists
is able to release more
of that type of information
than the rest of the world press combined.
How do people release the documents?
And how do you secure their privacy?
classical whistleblowers,
and we have a number of ways for them
to get information to us.
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption
to bounce stuff around the Internet, to hide trails,
pass it through legal jurisdictions
like Sweden and Belgium
to enact those legal protections.
We get information in the mail,
the regular postal mail,
encrypted or not,
vet it like a regular news organization, format it --
which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do,
when you're talking about
giant databases of information --
release it to the public
and then defend ourselves
against the inevitable legal and political attacks.
the documents are legitimate,
but you actually
almost never know who the identity of the source is?
and if we find out at some stage
then we destroy that information as soon as possible.
(Phone ring) God damn it.
for a TED membership.
This is something
you leaked a few years ago.
If we can have this document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago.
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened?
This was a secret intelligence report
commissioned by the Kenyan government
after its election in 2004.
Prior to 2004, Kenya was ruled
by Daniel arap Moi
for about 18 years.
He was a soft dictator of Kenya.
And when Kibaki got into power --
through a coalition of forces that were trying
to clean up corruption in Kenya --
they commissioned this report,
spent about two million pounds
on this and an associated report.
And then the government sat on it
and used it for political leverage on Moi,
who was the richest man --
still is the richest man -- in Kenya.
It's the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism.
So I went there in 2007,
and we managed to get hold of this
just prior to the election --
the national election, December 28.
When we released that report,
we did so three days after the new president, Kibaki,
had decided to pal up with
the man that he was going to clean out,
Daniel arap Moi,
so this report then
became a dead albatross
around President Kibaki's neck.
word of the report leaked into Kenya,
not from the official media, but indirectly,
and in your opinion, it actually shifted the election.
JA: Yeah. So this became front page of the Guardian
and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya,
in Tanzanian and South African press.
And so it came in from the outside.
And that, after a couple of days,
made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it.
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV,
shifted the vote by 10 percent,
according to a Kenyan intelligence report,
which changed the result of the election.
really substantially changed the world?
a short clip from this
Baghdad airstrike video.
The video itself is longer,
but here's a short clip.
This is -- this is intense material, I should warn you.
I see your element, uh, got about four Humvees, uh, out along ...
You're clear. All right. Firing.
Let me know when you've got them. Let's shoot.
Light 'em all up.
C'mon, fire!
(Machine gun fire)
Keep shoot 'n. Keep shoot 'n.
(Machine gun fire)
Keep shoot 'n.
Hotel ... Bushmaster Two-Six, Bushmaster Two-Six,
we need to move, time now!
All right, we just engaged all eight individuals.
Yeah, we see two birds [helicopters], and we're still firing.
Roger. I got 'em.
Two-Six, this is Two-Six, we're mobile.
Oops, I'm sorry. What was going on?
God damn it, Kyle. All right, hahaha. I hit 'em.
was severe.
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad
to further research that story.
So this is just the first of three attacks
that occurred in that scene.
including two Reuters employees?
two young children were wounded.
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together.
widespread outrage.
What was the key element of this
that actually caused the outrage, do you think?
the gross disparity in force.
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street,
and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer
firing 30-millimeter cannon shells
on everyone --
looking for any excuse to do so --
and killing people rescuing the wounded.
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren't insurgents
because that's their full-time job.
Bradley Manning, arrested,
and it's alleged that he confessed in a chat room
to have leaked this video to you,
along with 280,000
classified U.S. embassy cables.
I mean, did he?
He has been charged,
about five days ago,
with obtaining 150,000 cables
and releasing 50.
Now, we had released,
early in the year,
a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy,
but this is not necessarily connected.
I mean, I was a known visitor of that embassy.
of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
reveal what the true state
of, say,
Arab governments are like,
the true human-rights abuses in those governments.
If you look at declassified cables,
that's the sort of material that's there.
I mean, in general, what's your philosophy?
Why is it right
to encourage leaking of secret information?
what sort of information
can achieve reform.
And there's a lot of information.
So information that organizations
are spending economic effort into concealing,
that's a really good signal
that when the information gets out,
there's a hope of it doing some good --
because the organizations that know it best,
that know it from the inside out,
are spending work to conceal it.
And that's what we've found in practice,
and that's what the history of journalism is.
either to the individuals concerned
or indeed to society at large,
where leaking can actually have
an unintended consequence?
I mean, we have a harm immunization policy.
We have a way of dealing with information
that has sort of personal --
personally identifying information in it.
But there are legitimate secrets --
you know, your records with your doctor;
that's a legitimate secret --
but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward
that are really sort of well-motivated.
And what would you say to, for example,
the, you know, the parent of someone
whose son is out serving the U.S. military,
and he says, "You know what,
you've put up something that someone had an incentive to put out.
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing
at people dying.
That gives the impression, has given the impression,
to millions of people around the world
that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people.
Actually, they're not. My son isn't. How dare you?"
What would you say to that?
But remember, the people in Baghdad,
the people in Iraq, the people in Afghanistan --
they don't need to see the video;
they see it every day.
So it's not going to change their opinion. It's not going to change their perception.
That's what they see every day.
It will change the perception and opinion
of the people who are paying for it all,
and that's our hope.
into what you see
as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government.
Light is good.
But do you see any irony in the fact that,
in order for you to shine that light,
you have to, yourself,
create secrecy around your sources?
any WikiLeaks dissidents yet.
We don't have sources who are dissidents on other sources.
Should they come forward, that would be a tricky situation for us,
but we're presumably acting in such a way
that people feel
morally compelled
to continue our mission, not to screw it up.
I'm curious as to the opinion in the TED audience.
You know, there might be a couple of views
of WikiLeaks and of Julian.
You know, hero -- people's hero --
bringing this important light.
Dangerous troublemaker.
Who's got the hero view?
Who's got the dangerous troublemaker view?
We have to try better. Let's show them another example.
Now here's something that you haven't yet leaked,
but I think for TED you are.
I mean it's an intriguing story that's just happened, right?
What is this?
sort of every day.
So late last year -- in November last year --
there was a series of well blowouts
in Albania,
like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico,
but not quite as big.
And we got a report --
a sort of engineering analysis into what happened --
saying that, in fact, security guards
from some rival, various competing oil firms
had, in fact, parked trucks there and blown them up.
And part of the Albanian government was in this, etc., etc.
And the engineering report
had nothing on the top of it,
so it was an extremely difficult document for us.
We couldn't verify it because we didn't know
who wrote it and knew what it was about.
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was
a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up.
So under that basis, we put it out and said,
"Look, we're skeptical about this thing.
We don't know, but what can we do?
The material looks good, it feels right,
but we just can't verify it."
And we then got a letter
just this week
from the company who wrote it,
wanting to track down the source --
(Laughter)
saying, "Hey, we want to track down the source."
And we were like, "Oh, tell us more.
What document is it, precisely, you're talking about?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document?
Is it really yours?"
So they sent us this screen shot
with the author
in the Microsoft Word ID.
Yeah.
(Applause)
That's happened quite a lot though.
This is like one of our methods
of identifying, of verifying, what a material is,
is to try and get these guys to write letters.
from inside BP?
we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort.
So our publication rate
over the past few months
has been sort of minimized
while we're re-engineering our back systems
for the phenomenal public interest that we have.
That's a problem.
I mean, like any sort of growing startup organization,
we are sort of overwhelmed
by our growth,
and that means we're getting enormous quantity
of whistleblower disclosures
of a very high caliber
but don't have enough people to actually
process and vet this information.
basically journalistic volunteers
and/or the funding of journalistic salaries?
I mean, we're an organization
that is hard to grow very quickly
because of the sort of material we deal with,
so we have to restructure
in order to have people
who will deal with the highest national security stuff,
and then lower security cases.
and how you came to do this.
And I think I read that as a kid
you went to 37 different schools.
Can that be right?
and then on the run from a cult,
so the combination between the two ...
that's a recipe for breeding paranoia.
you were also a hacker at an early age
and ran into the authorities early on.
JA: Well, I was a journalist.
You know, I was a very young journalist activist at an early age.
I wrote a magazine,
was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager.
So you have to be careful with hacker.
I mean there's like -- there's a method
that can be deployed for various things.
Unfortunately, at the moment,
it's mostly deployed by the Russian mafia
in order to steal your grandmother's bank accounts.
So this phrase is not,
not as nice as it used to be.
you're stealing anyone's grandmother's bank account,
but what about
your core values?
Can you give us a sense of what they are
and maybe some incident in your life
that helped determine them?
But the core values:
well, capable, generous men
do not create victims;
they nurture victims.
And that's something from my father
and something from other capable, generous men
that have been in my life.
they nurture victims?
I'm a combative person,
so I'm not actually so big on the nurture,
but some way --
there is another way of nurturing victims,
which is to police perpetrators
of crime.
And so that is something
that has been in my character
for a long time.
what happened in Iceland?
You basically published something there,
ran into trouble with a bank,
then the news service there
was injuncted from running the story.
Instead, they publicized your side.
That made you very high-profile in Iceland. What happened next?
Iceland went through this financial crisis.
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world.
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP
of the rest of the economy.
Anyway, so we release this report
in July last year.
And the national TV station was injuncted
five minutes before it went on air,
like out of a movie: injunction landed on the news desk,
and the news reader was like,
"This has never happened before. What do we do?"
Well, we just show the website instead,
for all that time, as a filler,
and we became very famous in Iceland,
went to Iceland and spoke about this issue.
And there was a feeling in the community
that that should never happen again,
and as a result,
working with Icelandic politicians
and some other international legal experts,
we put together a new sort of
package of legislation for Iceland
to sort of become an offshore haven
for the free press,
with the strongest journalistic protections in the world,
with a new Nobel Prize
for freedom of speech.
Iceland's a Nordic country,
so, like Norway, it's able to tap into the system.
And just a month ago,
this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously.
When you think of the future then,
do you think it's more likely to be
Big Brother exerting more control,
more secrecy,
or us watching
Big Brother,
or it's just all to be played for either way?
I mean, there's enormous pressures
to harmonize freedom of speech legislation
and transparency legislation around the world --
within the E.U.,
between China and the United States.
Which way is it going to go? It's hard to see.
That's why it's a very interesting time to be in --
because with just a little bit of effort,
we can shift it one way or the other.
to say, Julian, be careful,
and all power to you.
I'm a storyteller.
That's what I do in life -- telling stories,
writing novels --
and today I would like to tell you a few stories
about the art of storytelling
and also some supernatural creatures
called the djinni.
But before I go there, please allow me to share with you
glimpses of my personal story.
I will do so with the help of words, of course,
but also a geometrical shape, the circle,
so throughout my talk,
you will come across several circles.
to Turkish parents.
Shortly after, my parents got separated,
and I came to Turkey with my mom.
From then on, I was raised
as a single child by a single mother.
Now in the early 1970s, in Ankara,
that was a bit unusual.
Our neighborhood was full of large families,
where fathers were the heads of households,
so I grew up seeing my mother as a divorcee
in a patriarchal environment.
In fact, I grew up observing
two different kinds of womanhood.
On the one hand was my mother,
a well-educated, secular, modern, westernized, Turkish woman.
On the other hand was my grandmother,
who also took care of me
and was more spiritual, less educated
and definitely less rational.
This was a woman who read coffee grounds to see the future
and melted lead into mysterious shapes
to fend off the evil eye.
people with severe acne on their faces
or warts on their hands.
Each time, my grandmother would utter some words in Arabic,
take a red apple and stab it
with as many rose thorns
as the number of warts she wanted to remove.
Then one by one, she would
encircle these thorns with dark ink.
A week later, the patient would come back
for a follow-up examination.
Now, I'm aware that I should not be saying such things
in front of an audience of scholars and scientists,
but the truth is, of all the people
who visited my grandmother for their skin conditions,
I did not see anyone go back
unhappy or unhealed.
I asked her how she did this. Was it the power of praying?
In response she said, "Yes, praying is effective,
but also beware of the power of circles."
one very precious lesson --
that if you want to destroy something in this life,
be it an acne, a blemish
or the human soul,
all you need to do is to surround it with thick walls.
It will dry up inside.
Now we all live in some kind of a social and cultural circle.
We all do.
We're born into a certain family, nation, class.
But if we have no connection whatsoever
with the worlds beyond the one we take for granted,
then we too run the risk
of drying up inside.
Our imagination might shrink;
our hearts might dwindle,
and our humanness might wither
if we stay for too long
inside our cultural cocoons.
Our friends, neighbors, colleagues, family --
if all the people in our inner circle resemble us,
it means we are surrounded
with our mirror image.
is to cover mirrors with velvet
or to hang them on the walls with their backs facing out.
It's an old Eastern tradition
based on the knowledge that it's not healthy
for a human being to spend too much time
staring at his own reflection.
Ironically, [living in] communities of the like-minded
is one of the greatest dangers
of today's globalized world.
And it's happening everywhere,
among liberals and conservatives,
agnostics and believers, the rich and the poor,
East and West alike.
We tend to form clusters
based on similarity,
and then we produce stereotypes
about other clusters of people.
In my opinion, one way of transcending
these cultural ghettos
is through the art of storytelling.
Stories cannot demolish frontiers,
but they can punch holes in our mental walls.
And through those holes, we can get a glimpse of the other,
and sometimes even like what we see.
My mother came home one day with a turquoise notebook
and asked me if I'd be interested in keeping a personal journal.
In retrospect, I think she was slightly worried
about my sanity.
I was constantly telling stories at home, which was good,
except I told this to imaginary friends around me,
which was not so good.
I was an introverted child,
to the point of communicating with colored crayons
and apologizing to objects
when I bumped into them,
so my mother thought it might do me good
to write down my day-to-day experiences
and emotions.
What she didn't know was that I thought my life was terribly boring,
and the last thing I wanted to do
was to write about myself.
Instead, I began to write about people other than me
and things that never really happened.
And thus began my life-long passion
for writing fiction.
So from the very beginning, fiction for me
was less of an autobiographical manifestation
than a transcendental journey
into other lives, other possibilities.
And please bear with me:
I'll draw a circle and come back to this point.
My mother became a diplomat.
So from this small, superstitious,
middle-class neighborhood of my grandmother,
I was zoomed into this
posh, international school [in Madrid],
where I was the only Turk.
It was here that I had my first encounter
with what I call the "representative foreigner."
In our classroom, there were children from all nationalities,
yet this diversity did not necessarily lead
to a cosmopolitan, egalitarian
classroom democracy.
Instead, it generated an atmosphere
in which each child was seen --
not as an individual on his own,
but as the representative of something larger.
We were like a miniature United Nations, which was fun,
except whenever something negative,
with regards to a nation
or a religion, took place.
The child who represented it was mocked,
ridiculed and bullied endlessly.
And I should know, because during the time I attended that school,
a military takeover happened in my country,
a gunman of my nationality nearly killed the Pope,
and Turkey got zero points in [the] Eurovision Song Contest.
(Laughter)
during those days.
I also had my first taste
of cultural stereotypes there.
The other children asked me about the movie
"Midnight Express," which I had not seen;
they inquired how many cigarettes a day I smoked,
because they thought all Turks were heavy smokers,
and they wondered at what age
I would start covering my hair.
I came to learn that these were
the three main stereotypes about my country:
politics, cigarettes
and the veil.
After Spain, we went to Jordan, Germany
and Ankara again.
Everywhere I went, I felt like
my imagination was the only suitcase
I could take with me.
Stories gave me a sense of center,
continuity and coherence,
the three big Cs that I otherwise lacked.
the city I adore.
I lived in a very vibrant, diverse neighborhood
where I wrote several of my novels.
I was in Istanbul when the earthquake hit
in 1999.
When I ran out of the building at three in the morning,
I saw something that stopped me in my tracks.
There was the local grocer there --
a grumpy, old man who didn't sell alcohol
and didn't speak to marginals.
He was sitting next to a transvestite
with a long black wig
and mascara running down her cheeks.
I watched the man open a pack of cigarettes
with trembling hands
and offer one to her,
and that is the image of the night of the earthquake
in my mind today --
a conservative grocer and a crying transvestite
smoking together on the sidewalk.
In the face of death and destruction,
our mundane differences evaporated,
and we all became one
even if for a few hours.
But I've always believed that stories, too, have a similar effect on us.
I'm not saying that fiction has the magnitude of an earthquake,
but when we are reading a good novel,
we leave our small, cozy apartments behind,
go out into the night alone
and start getting to know people we had never met before
and perhaps had even been biased against.
to a women's college in Boston, then Michigan.
I experienced this, not so much as a geographical shift,
as a linguistic one.
I started writing fiction in English.
I'm not an immigrant, refugee or exile --
they ask me why I do this --
but the commute between languages
gives me the chance to recreate myself.
I love writing in Turkish,
which to me is very poetic and very emotional,
and I love writing in English, which to me
is very mathematical and cerebral.
So I feel connected to each language in a different way.
For me, like millions of other people
around the world today,
English is an acquired language.
When you're a latecomer to a language,
what happens is you live there
with a continuous
and perpetual frustration.
As latecomers, we always want to say more, you know,
crack better jokes, say better things,
but we end up saying less
because there's a gap between the mind and the tongue.
And that gap is very intimidating.
But if we manage not to be frightened by it,
it's also stimulating.
And this is what I discovered in Boston --
that frustration was very stimulating.
who had been watching the course of my life
with increasing anxiety,
started to include in her daily prayers
that I urgently get married
so that I could settle down once and for all.
And because God loves her, I did get married.
(Laughter)
But instead of settling down,
I went to Arizona.
And since my husband is in Istanbul,
I started commuting between Arizona and Istanbul --
the two places on the surface of earth
that couldn't be more different.
I guess one part of me has always been a nomad,
physically and spiritually.
Stories accompany me,
keeping my pieces and memories together,
like an existential glue.
recently, I've also begun to think
that they lose their magic
if and when a story is seen as more than a story.
And this is a subject that I would love
to think about together.
When my first novel written in English came out in America,
I heard an interesting remark from a literary critic.
"I liked your book," he said, "but I wish you had written it differently."
(Laughter)
I asked him what he meant by that.
He said, "Well, look at it. There's so many
Spanish, American, Hispanic characters in it,
but there's only one Turkish character and it's a man."
Now the novel took place on a university campus in Boston,
so to me, it was normal
that there be more international characters in it
than Turkish characters,
but I understood what my critic was looking for.
And I also understood that I
would keep disappointing him.
He wanted to see the manifestation of my identity.
He was looking for a Turkish woman in the book
because I happened to be one.
but we should also see how the world of identity politics
affects the way stories
are being circulated,
read and reviewed.
Many authors feel this pressure,
but non-Western authors feel it more heavily.
If you're a woman writer from the Muslim world, like me,
then you are expected to write
the stories of Muslim women
and, preferably, the unhappy stories
of unhappy Muslim women.
You're expected to write
informative, poignant and characteristic stories
and leave the experimental and avant-garde
to your Western colleagues.
What I experienced as a child in that school in Madrid
is happening in the literary world today.
Writers are not seen
as creative individuals on their own,
but as the representatives
of their respective cultures:
a few authors from China, a few from Turkey,
a few from Nigeria.
We're all thought to have something very distinctive,
if not peculiar.
gave an interview in 1984
in which he was repeatedly asked about his homosexuality.
When the interviewer tried to pigeonhole him
as a gay writer,
Baldwin stopped and said,
"But don't you see? There's nothing in me
that is not in everybody else,
and nothing in everybody else
that is not in me."
When identity politics tries to put labels on us,
it is our freedom of imagination that is in danger.
There's a fuzzy category called
multicultural literature
in which all authors from outside the Western world
are lumped together.
I never forget my first multicultural reading,
in Harvard Square about 10 years ago.
We were three writers, one from the Philippines,
one Turkish and one Indonesian --
like a joke, you know.
(Laughter)
And the reason why we were brought together
was not because we shared an artistic style
or a literary taste.
It was only because of our passports.
Multicultural writers are expected to tell real stories,
not so much the imaginary.
A function is attributed to fiction.
In this way, not only the writers themselves,
but also their fictional characters
become the representatives of something larger.
that this tendency to see a story
as more than a story
does not solely come from the West.
It comes from everywhere.
And I experienced this firsthand
when I was put on trial in 2005
for the words my fictional characters uttered in a novel.
I had intended to write
a constructive, multi-layered novel
about an Armenian and a Turkish family
through the eyes of women.
My micro story became a macro issue
when I was prosecuted.
Some people criticized, others praised me
for writing about the Turkish-Armenian conflict.
But there were times when I wanted to remind both sides
that this was fiction.
It was just a story.
And when I say, "just a story,"
I'm not trying to belittle my work.
I want to love and celebrate fiction
for what it is,
not as a means to an end.
and there are good political novels out there,
but the language of fiction
is not the language of daily politics.
Chekhov said,
"The solution to a problem
and the correct way of posing the question
are two completely separate things.
And only the latter is an artist's responsibility."
Identity politics divides us. Fiction connects.
One is interested in sweeping generalizations.
The other, in nuances.
One draws boundaries.
The other recognizes no frontiers.
Identity politics is made of solid bricks.
Fiction is flowing water.
They would go to coffee houses,
where they would tell a story in front of an audience,
often improvising.
With each new person in the story,
the meddah would change his voice,
impersonating that character.
Everybody could go and listen, you know --
ordinary people, even the sultan, Muslims and non-Muslims.
Stories cut across all boundaries,
like "The Tales of Nasreddin Hodja,"
which were very popular throughout the Middle East,
North Africa, the Balkans and Asia.
Today, stories continue
to transcend borders.
When Palestinian and Israeli politicians talk,
they usually don't listen to each other,
but a Palestinian reader
still reads a novel by a Jewish author,
and vice versa, connecting and empathizing
with the narrator.
Literature has to take us beyond.
If it cannot take us there,
it is not good literature.
timid child that I was -- that I once was.
But I'm also aware of the danger
of fetishizing them.
When the poet and mystic, Rumi,
met his spiritual companion, Shams of Tabriz,
one of the first things the latter did
was to toss Rumi's books into water
and watch the letters dissolve.
The Sufis say, "Knowledge that takes you not beyond yourself
is far worse than ignorance."
The problem with today's cultural ghettos
is not lack of knowledge --
we know a lot about each other, or so we think --
but knowledge that takes us not beyond ourselves:
it makes us elitist,
distant and disconnected.
There's a metaphor which I love:
living like a drawing compass.
As you know, one leg of the compass is static, rooted in a place.
Meanwhile, the other leg
draws a wide circle, constantly moving.
Like that, my fiction as well.
One part of it is rooted in Istanbul,
with strong Turkish roots,
but the other part travels the world,
connecting to different cultures.
In that sense, I like to think of my fiction
as both local and universal,
both from here and everywhere.
have probably seen Topkapi Palace,
which was the residence of Ottoman sultans
for more than 400 years.
In the palace, just outside the quarters
of the favorite concubines,
there's an area called The Gathering Place of the Djinn.
It's between buildings.
I'm intrigued by this concept.
We usually distrust those areas
that fall in between things.
We see them as the domain
of supernatural creatures like the djinn,
who are made of smokeless fire
and are the symbol of elusiveness.
But my point is perhaps
that elusive space
is what writers and artists need most.
When I write fiction
I cherish elusiveness and changeability.
I like not knowing what will happen 10 pages later.
I like it when my characters surprise me.
I might write about
a Muslim woman in one novel,
and perhaps it will be a very happy story,
and in my next book, I might write
about a handsome, gay professor in Norway.
As long as it comes from our hearts,
we can write about anything and everything.
"The white fathers taught us to say,
'I think, therefore I am.'"
She suggested, "I feel, therefore I am free."
I think it was a wonderful paradigm shift.
And yet, why is it that,
in creative writing courses today,
the very first thing we teach students is
"write what you know"?
Perhaps that's not the right way to start at all.
Imaginative literature is not necessarily about
writing who we are or what we know
or what our identity is about.
We should teach young people and ourselves
to expand our hearts
and write what we can feel.
We should get out of our cultural ghetto
and go visit the next one and the next.
drawing circles beyond circles.
They connect all humanity,
regardless of identity politics,
and that is the good news.
And I would like to finish with an old Sufi poem:
"Come, let us be friends for once;
let us make life easy on us;
let us be lovers and loved ones;
the earth shall be left to no one."
I'm an American, which means, generally,
I ignore football unless it involves
guys my size or Bruno's size
running into each other at extremely high speeds.
That said, it's been really hard
to ignore football
for the last couple of weeks.
FIFA, vuvuzela,
weird jokes about octopi.
But the one that's really been sort of stressing me out,
that I haven't been able to figure out,
is this phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao."
If you've gone onto Twitter in the last couple of weeks,
you've probably seen this.
It's been a major trending topic.
and I asked some people if they could explain to me "Cala a boca, Galvao."
And fortunately, my Brazilian friends
were more than ready to help.
They explained that the Galvao bird
is a rare and endangered parrot
that's in terrible, terrible danger.
In fact, I'll let them tell you a bit more about it.
Narrator: A word about Galvao, a very rare kind of bird
native to Brazil.
Every year, more than 300,000 Galvao birds
are killed during Carnival parades.
Ethan Zuckerman: Obviously, this is a tragic situation,
and it actually gets worse.
It turns out that, not only is the Galvao parrot
very attractive, useful for headdresses,
it evidently has certain hallucinogenic properties,
which means that there's a terrible problem
with Galvao abuse.
Some sick and twisted people have found themselves snorting Galvao.
And it's terribly endangered.
The good news about this is that the global community --
again, my Brazilian friends tell me --
is pitching in to help out.
It turns out that Lady Gaga
has released a new single --
actually five or six new singles, as near as I can tell --
titled "Cala a boca, Galvao."
And my Brazilian friends tell me that
if I just tweet the phrase "Cala a boca, Galvao,"
10 cents will be given
to a global campaign
to save this rare and beautiful bird.
and actually a very, very good one.
"Cala a boca, Galvao" actually means something very different.
In Portugese, it means "Shut your mouth, Galvao."
And it specifically refers to this guy, Galvao Bueno,
who's the lead soccer commentator
for Rede Globo.
And what I understand from my Brazilian friends
is that this guy is just a cliche machine.
He can ruin the most interesting match
by just spouting cliche again and again and again.
So Brazilians went to that first match
put up this banner, started a Twitter campaign
and tried to convince the rest of us
to tweet the phrase: "Cala a boca, Galvao."
And in fact, were so successful at this
that it topped Twitter for two weeks.
there's a couple of lessons that you can take from this.
And the first lesson, which I think is a worthwhile one,
is that you cannot go wrong
asking people to be active online,
so long as activism just means retweeting a phrase.
So as long as activism is that simple,
it's pretty easy to get away with.
The other thing you can take from this, by the way,
is that there are a lot of Brazilians on Twitter.
There's more than five million of them.
As far as national representation,
11 percent of Brazilian internet users are on Twitter.
That's a much higher number than in the U.S. or U.K.
Next to Japan,
it's the second most represented by population.
and you didn't realize
this was a space with a lot of Brazilians in it,
you're like most of us.
Because what happens on a social network
is you interact with the people
that you have chosen to interact with.
And if you are like me, a big, geeky, white, American guy,
you tend to interact with a lot of other geeky, white, American guys.
And you don't necessarily have the sense
that Twitter is in fact a very heavily Brazilian space.
Twitter recently did some research.
They looked at their local population.
They believe that 24 percent
of American Twitter users are African-American.
That's about twice as high as African-Americans
are represented in the population.
And again, that was very shocking to many Twitter users,
but it shouldn't be.
And you tend to find topics
and Martin Wattenberg,
two amazing visualization designers,
who looked at
a weekend's worth of Twitter traffic
and essentially found that a lot of these trending topics
were basically segregated conversations --
and in ways that you wouldn't expect.
It turns out that oil spill is a mostly white conversation,
that cookout
is a mostly black conversation.
And what's crazy about this is that
if you wanted to mix up who you were seeing on Twitter,
it's literally a quick click away.
You click on that cookout tag, there an entirely different conversation
But generally speaking, most of us don't.
where we see the people we already know
and the people who are similar to the people we already know.
And we tend not to see that wider picture.
because this wasn't how the internet was supposed to be.
If you go back into the early days of the internet,
when cyber-utopians like Nick Negroponte
were writing big books like "Being Digital,"
the prediction was that the internet
was going to be an incredibly powerful force
to smooth out cultural differences,
to put us all on a common field of one fashion or another.
Negroponte started his book with a story
about how hard it is to build connections
in the world of atoms.
He's at a technology conference in Florida.
And he's looking at something really, truly absurd,
which is bottles of Evian water on the table.
And Negroponte says this is crazy.
This is the old economy.
It's the economy of moving these
heavy, slow atoms over long distances that's very difficult to do.
We're heading to the future of bits,
where everything is speedy, it's weightless.
It can be anywhere in the world at any time.
And it's going to change the world as we know it.
He's totally wrong about this one.
If I walk into a store in the United States,
it's very, very easy for me to buy water
that's bottled in Fiji,
shipped at great expense to the United States.
It's actually surprisingly hard
for me to see a Fijian feature film.
It's really difficult for me to listen to Fijian music.
It's extremely difficult for me to get Fijian news,
which is strange, because actually there's an enormous amount going on in Fiji.
I think that we tend to look a lot
at the infrastructure
of globalization.
We look at the framework that makes it possible
to live in this connected world.
We look at a map like this one,
and it looks like the entire world is flat
because everything is a hop or two away.
You can get on a flight in London,
you can end up in Bangalore later today.
Two hops, you're in Suva, the capitol of Fiji.
It's all right there.
flows on top of these networks,
you get a very different picture.
You start looking at how
the global plane flights move,
There are parts of the world that are very, very well connected.
but look at this map, and you can watch this
for, you know, two or three minutes.
You won't see very many planes
go from South America to Africa.
And you'll discover that there are parts of the globe
that are systematically cut off.
When we stop looking at the infrastructure that makes connection possible,
and we look at what actually happens,
we start realizing that the world doesn't work quite the same way
that we think it does.
in the last decade or so.
The world is, in fact, getting more global.
It's getting more connected.
More of problems are global in scale.
More of our economics is global in scale.
And our media is less global by the day.
on a nightly new broadcast.
That's down to about 12 to 15 percent.
And this tends to give us a very distorted view of the world.
Here's a slide that Alisa Miller showed at a previous TED Talk.
Alisa's the president of Public Radio International.
And she made a cartogram, which is basically a distorted map
looked at for a month.
the world within American television news
is basically reduced to
this giant bloated U.S.
and a couple of other countries which we've invaded.
And that's basically what our media is about.
And before you conclude that this is just a function of American TV news --
which is dreadful, and I agree that it's dreadful --
When you look at the New York Times, you look at other elite media,
what you largely get are pictures of very wealthy nations
and the nations we've invaded.
that have been geo-coded.
Even within Wikipedias,
where we're creating their own content online,
rather than to the rest of the world.
In the U.K., you can get up,
you can pick up your computer when you get out of this session,
you could read a newspaper from India or from Australia,
from Canada, God forbid from the U.S.
You probably won't.
If you look at online media consumption --
It's one of these rare cases where the U.S. is actually slightly better than [the U.K.],
because we actually like reading your media,
rather than vice versa.
to think that we're in a state that I refer to
as imaginary cosmopolitanism.
We look at the internet.
We think we're getting this wide view of the globe.
to connect us to the rest of the world.
And we forget that most of the time
we're checking Boston Red Sox scores.
So this is a real problem --
not just because the Red Sox are having a bad year --
but it's a real problem because,
as we're discussing here at TED,
the real problems in the world
the interesting problems to solve
are global in scale and scope,
they require global conversations
to get to global solutions.
This is a problem we have to solve.
For six years, I've been hanging out with these guys.
This is a group called Global Voices.
This is a team of bloggers from around the world.
Our mission was to fix the world's media.
We started in 2004.
You might have noticed, we haven't done all that well so far.
Nor do I think we are by ourselves,
actually going to solve the problem.
But the more that I think about it, the more that I think
if we we wanted to use the web to have a wider world.
The first thing you have to consider
is that there are parts of the world
that are dark spots in terms of attention.
In this case -- the map of the world at night by NASA --
they're dark literally because of lack of electricity.
And I used to think that a dark spot on this map
basically meant you're not going to get media from there
because there are more basic needs.
you can get media, it's just an enormous amount of work,
and you need an enormous amount of encouragement.
One of those dark spots is Madagascar,
but what happened was that Madagascar
went through a violent coup.
Most independent media was shut down.
which is sort of sad if you think about it,
as it's now the most represented language on the internet.
and very quickly at a mouse click
will give you a translation of the page.
Unfortunately, it's a machine translation of the page.
And while Google is very, very good with some languages,
it's actually pretty dreadful with Chinese.
And the results can be pretty funny.
What you really want -- what I really want,
is eventually the ability to push a button
and have this queued
so a human being can translate this.
There's a group right now in China called Yeeyan.
And Yeeyan is a group
of 150,000 volunteers
who get online every day.
They look for the most interesting content in the English language.
They translate roughly 100 articles a day
from major newspapers, major websites.
They put it online for free.
It's the project of a guy named Zhang Lei,
who was living in the United States during the Lhasa riots
and who couldn't believe how biased
American media coverage was.
And he said, "If there's one thing I can do, I can start translating,
so that people between these countries
start understanding each other a little bit better."
And my question to you is:
if Yeeyan can line up 150,000 people
to translate the English internet into Chinese,
where's the English language Yeeyan?
Who's going after Chinese,
which now has 400 million internet users out there?
My guess is at least one of them has something interesting to say.
there's no guarantee that we're going to find it.
When we look for information online,
we basically have two strategies.
We use a lot of search.
And search is terrific if you know what you're looking for.
But if what you're looking for is serendipity,
if you want to stumble onto something
that you didn't know you needed,
our main philosophy is to look to our social networks,
to look for our friends.
What are they looking at? Maybe we should be looking at it.
The problem with this is that essentially
what you end up getting after a while is the wisdom of the flock.
You end up flocking with a lot of people
who are probably similar to you,
who have similar interests.
And it's very, very hard to get information
from the other flocks, from the other parts of the world
where people getting together and talking about their own interests.
To do this, at a certain point,
you need someone to bump you out of your flock and into another flock.
You need a guide.
She has one of the hardest jobs in the world.
Not only does she have to keep our Israeli and Palestinian contributors
from killing each other,
she has to figure out
what is going to interest you
about the Middle East.
And in that sense of trying to get you
out of your normal orbit,
and to try to get you to pay attention
to a story about someone who's
given up smoking for the month of Ramadan,
she has to know something about a global audience.
She has to know something about what stories are available.
Basically, she's a deejay.
She's a skilled human curator
who knows what material is available to her,
who's able to listen to the audience,
and who's able to make a selection
and push people forward in one fashion or another.
I don't think this is necessarily an algorithmic process.
I think what's great about the internet
is that it actually makes it much easier
for deejays to reach a wider audience.
I know Amira.
I can ask her what to read.
But with the internet, she's in a position where she can
tell a lot of people what to read.
And you can listen to her as well,
if this is a way that you're interested in having your web widened.
once you start lighting up voices in the dark spots,
once you start translating, once you start curating,
you end up in some really weird places.
This is an image from pretty much my favorite blog,
which is AfriGadget.
And AfriGadget is a blog that looks
at technology in an Africa context.
And specifically, it's looking at a blacksmith
in Kibera in Nairobi,
who is turning the shaft of a Landrover
into a cold chisel.
And when you look at this image, you might find yourself going,
"Why would I conceivably care about this?"
And the truth is, this guy can probably explain this to you.
This is Erik Hersman. You guys may have seen him around the conference.
He goes by the moniker White African.
He's both a very well known American geek,
but he's also Kenyan; he was born in Sudan, grew up in Kenya.
He is a bridge figure.
He is someone who literally has feet in both worlds --
one in the world of the African technology community,
one in the world of the American technology community.
And so he's able to tell a story
about this blacksmith in Kibera
and turn it into a story about repurposing technology,
about innovating from constraint,
about looking for inspiration based on reusing materials.
He knows one world,
and he's finding a way to communicate it to another world,
both of which he has deep connections to.
These bridge figures, I'm pretty well convinced,
are the future of how we try to make the world wider
through using the web.
you need someone to cross them.
And that's where we start talking about xenophiles.
So if I found myself in the NFL,
I suspect I would spend my off-season
nursing my wounds, enjoying my house, so on and so forth --
possibly recording a hip-hop album.
Dhani Jones,
who is the middle linebacker for the Cincinnati Bengals,
has a slightly different approach to the off-season.
Dhani has a television show.
It's called "Dhani Tackles the Globe."
And every week on this television show,
Dhani travels to a different nation of the world.
He finds a local sporting team.
He trains with them for a week, and he plays a match with them.
And his reason for this
is not just that he wants to master Muay Thai boxing.
It's because, for him,
sport is the language
that allows him to encounter
the full width and wonder of the world.
For some of us it might be music. For some of us it might be food.
For a lot of us it might be literature or writing.
But there are all these different techniques
that allow you to go out and look at the world
and find your place within it.
is not to persuade the people in this room
to embrace your xenophilia.
My guess -- given that you're at a conference called TEDGlobal --
is that most of you are xenophiles,
whether or not you use that term.
My challenge instead is this.
It's not enough to make the personal decision
that you want a wider world.
We have to figure out how to rewire
the systems that we have.
We have to fix our media.
We have to fix the internet. We have to fix our education.
We have to fix our immigration policy.
We need to look at ways
of creating serendipity,
of making translation pervasive,
and we need to find ways to embrace
and celebrate these bridge figures.
And we need to figure out how to cultivate xenophiles.
That's what I'm trying to do. I need your help.
When I was a student here in Oxford in the 1970s,
the future of the world was bleak.
The population explosion was unstoppable.
Global famine was inevitable.
A cancer epidemic caused by chemicals in the environment
was going to shorten our lives.
The acid rain was falling on the forests.
The desert was advancing by a mile or two a year.
The oil was running out,
and a nuclear winter would finish us off.
None of those things happened,
(Laughter)
and astonishingly, if you look at what actually happened in my lifetime,
the average per-capita income
of the average person on the planet,
in real terms, adjusted for inflation,
has tripled.
Lifespan is up by 30 percent in my lifetime.
Child mortality is down by two-thirds.
Per-capita food production
is up by a third.
And all this at a time when the population has doubled.
How did we achieve that?
How did we become
the only species
that becomes more prosperous
as it becomes more populous?
The size of the blob in this graph represents the size of the population,
and the level of the graph
represents GDP per capita.
I think to answer that question
you need to understand
how human beings bring together their brains
and enable their ideas to combine and recombine,
to meet and, indeed, to mate.
In other words, you need to understand
how ideas have sex.
how we got from making objects like this
to making objects like this.
These are both real objects.
One is an Acheulean hand axe from half a million years ago
of the kind made by Homo erectus.
The other is obviously a computer mouse.
They're both exactly the same size and shape to an uncanny degree.
I've tried to work out which is bigger,
and it's almost impossible.
And that's because they're both designed to fit the human hand.
They're both technologies. In the end, their similarity is not that interesting.
It just tells you they were both designed to fit the human hand.
The differences are what interest me,
because the one on the left was made to a pretty unvarying design
for about a million years --
from one-and-a-half million years ago to half a million years ago.
Homo erectus made the same tool
for 30,000 generations.
Of course there were a few changes,
but tools changed slower than skeletons in those days.
There was no progress, no innovation.
It's an extraordinary phenomenon, but it's true.
Whereas the object on the right is obsolete after five years.
And there's another difference too,
which is the object on the left is made from one substance.
The object on the right is made from
a confection of different substances,
from silicon and metal and plastic and so on.
And more than that, it's a confection of different ideas,
the idea of plastic, the idea of a laser,
the idea of transistors.
They've all been combined together in this technology.
this cumulative technology, that intrigues me,
because I think it's the secret to understanding
what's happening in the world.
My body's an accumulation of ideas too:
the idea of skin cells, the idea of brain cells, the idea of liver cells.
They've come together.
How does evolution do cumulative, combinatorial things?
Well, it uses sexual reproduction.
In an asexual species, if you get two different mutations in different creatures,
a green one and a red one,
then one has to be better than the other.
One goes extinct for the other to survive.
But if you have a sexual species,
then it's possible for an individual
to inherit both mutations
from different lineages.
So what sex does is it enables the individual
to draw upon
the genetic innovations of the whole species.
It's not confined to its own lineage.
in cultural evolution
as sex is having in biological evolution?
And I think the answer is exchange,
the habit of exchanging one thing for another.
It's a unique human feature.
No other animal does it.
You can teach them in the laboratory to do a little bit of exchange --
and indeed there's reciprocity in other animals --
But the exchange of one object for another never happens.
As Adam Smith said, "No man ever saw a dog
make a fair exchange of a bone with another dog."
(Laughter)
You can have culture without exchange.
You can have, as it were, asexual culture.
Chimpanzees, killer whales, these kinds of creatures, they have culture.
They teach each other traditions
which are handed down from parent to offspring.
In this case, chimpanzees teaching each other
how to crack nuts with rocks.
But the difference is
that these cultures never expand, never grow,
never accumulate, never become combinatorial,
and the reason is because
there is no sex, as it were,
there is no exchange of ideas.
Chimpanzee troops have different cultures in different troops.
There's no exchange of ideas between them.
Well, the answer came from David Ricardo in 1817.
And here is a Stone Age version of his story,
although he told it in terms of trade between countries.
Adam takes four hours to make a spear and three hours to make an axe.
Oz takes one hour to make a spear and two hours to make an axe.
So Oz is better at both spears and axes than Adam.
He doesn't need Adam.
He can make his own spears and axes.
Well no, because if you think about it,
if Oz makes two spears and Adam make two axes,
and then they trade,
then they will each have saved an hour of work.
And the more they do this, the more true it's going to be,
because the more they do this, the better Adam is going to get at making axes
and the better Oz is going to get at making spears.
So the gains from trade are only going to grow.
And this is one of the beauties of exchange,
is it actually creates the momentum
for more specialization,
which creates the momentum for more exchange and so on.
Adam and Oz both saved an hour of time.
That is prosperity, the saving of time
in satisfying your needs.
to provide for yourself
an hour of reading light this evening to read a book by.
If you had to start from scratch, let's say you go out into the countryside.
You find a sheep. You kill it. You get the fat out of it.
You render it down. You make a candle, etc. etc.
How long is it going to take you? Quite a long time.
How long do you actually have to work
to earn an hour of reading light
if you're on the average wage in Britain today?
And the answer is about half a second.
Back in 1950,
you would have had to work for eight seconds on the average wage
to acquire that much light.
And that's seven and a half seconds of prosperity that you've gained
since 1950, as it were,
because that's seven and a half seconds in which you can do something else,
or you can acquire another good or service.
And back in 1880,
it would have been 15 minutes
to earn that amount of light on the average wage.
Back in 1800,
you'd have had to work six hours
to earn a candle that could burn for an hour.
In other words, the average person on the average wage
could not afford a candle in 1800.
and ask yourself: "Who made them and for who?"
The stone axe was made by someone for himself.
It was self-sufficiency.
We call that poverty these days.
But the object on the right
was made for me by other people.
How many other people?
Tens? Hundreds? Thousands?
You know, I think it's probably millions.
Because you've got to include the man who grew the coffee,
which was brewed for the man who was on the oil rig,
who was drilling for oil, which was going to be made into the plastic, etc.
They were all working for me,
to make a mouse for me.
And that's the way society works.
That's what we've achieved as a species.
you literally had people working for you.
That's how you got to be rich; you employed them.
Louis XIV had a lot of people working for him.
They made his silly outfits, like this,
(Laughter)
and they did his silly hairstyles, or whatever.
He had 498 people
to prepare his dinner every night.
But a modern tourist going around the palace of Versailles
and looking at Louis XIV's pictures,
he has 498 people doing his dinner tonight too.
They're in bistros and cafes and restaurants
and shops all over Paris,
and they're all ready to serve you at an hour's notice with an excellent meal
that's probably got higher quality
than Louis XIV even had.
And that's what we've done, because we're all working for each other.
We're able to draw upon specialization and exchange
to raise each other's living standards.
Ants are a classic example; workers work for queens and queens work for workers.
But there's a big difference,
which is that it only happens within the colony.
There's no working for each other across the colonies.
And the reason for that is because there's a reproductive division of labor.
That is to say, they specialize with respect to reproduction.
The queen does it all.
In our species, we don't like doing that.
It's the one thing we insist on doing for ourselves, is reproduction.
(Laughter)
Even in England, we don't leave reproduction to the Queen.
And how long has it been going on? And what does it mean?
Well, I think, probably, the oldest version of this
is probably the sexual division of labor.
But I've got no evidence for that.
It just looks like the first thing we did
was work male for female and female for male.
In all hunter-gatherer societies today,
there's a foraging division of labor
between, on the whole, hunting males and gathering females.
It isn't always quite that simple,
but there's a distinction between
specialized roles for males and females.
And the beauty of this system
is that it benefits both sides.
The woman knows
that, in the Hadzas' case here --
digging roots to share with men in exchange for meat --
she knows that all she has to do to get access to protein
is to dig some extra roots and trade them for meat.
And she doesn't have to go on an exhausting hunt
and try and kill a warthog.
And the man knows that he doesn't have to do any digging
to get roots.
All he has to do is make sure that when he kills a warthog
it's big enough to share some.
And so both sides raise each other's standards of living
through the sexual division of labor.
that Neanderthals didn't do this.
They were a highly cooperative species.
They were a highly intelligent species.
Their brains on average, by the end, were bigger than yours and mine
in this room today.
They were imaginative. They buried their dead.
They had language, probably,
because we know they had the FOXP2 gene of the same kind as us,
which was discovered here in Oxford.
And so it looks like they probably had linguistic skills.
They were brilliant people. I'm not dissing the Neanderthals.
But there's no evidence
of a sexual division of labor.
There's no evidence of gathering behavior by females.
It looks like the females were cooperative hunters with the men.
And the other thing there's no evidence for
is exchange between groups,
because the objects that you find in Neanderthal remains,
the tools they made,
are always made from local materials.
For example, in the Caucasus
there's a site where you find local Neanderthal tools.
They're always made from local chert.
In the same valley there are modern human remains
from about the same date, 30,000 years ago,
and some of those are from local chert,
but more -- but many of them are made
from obsidian from a long way away.
And when human beings began
moving objects around like this,
it was evidence that they were exchanging between groups.
People forget that. People think of trade as a modern thing.
Exchange between groups has been going on
for a hundred thousand years.
And the earliest evidence for it crops up
somewhere between 80 and 120,000 years ago in Africa,
when you see obsidian and jasper and other things
moving long distances in Ethiopia.
You also see seashells --
as discovered by a team here in Oxford --
moving 125 miles inland
from the Mediterranean in Algeria.
And that's evidence that people
have started exchanging between groups.
And that will have led to specialization.
means trade rather than migration?
Well, you look at modern hunter gatherers like aboriginals,
who quarried for stone axes at a place called Mount Isa,
which was a quarry owned by the Kalkadoon tribe.
They traded them with their neighbors
for things like stingray barbs,
and the consequence was that stone axes
ended up over a large part of Australia.
So long-distance movement of tools
is a sign of trade, not migration.
from the ability to exchange and specialize?
And the answer is that
not only do you slow down technological progress,
you can actually throw it into reverse.
An example is Tasmania.
When the sea level rose and Tasmania became an island 10,000 years ago,
the people on it not only experienced
slower progress than people on the mainland,
they actually experienced regress.
They gave up the ability to make stone tools
and fishing equipment and clothing
because the population of about 4,000 people
was simply not large enough
to maintain the specialized skills
necessary to keep the technology they had.
It's as if the people in this room were plonked on a desert island.
How many of the things in our pockets
could we continue to make after 10,000 years?
It didn't happen in Tierra del Fuego --
similar island, similar people.
The reason: because Tierra del Fuego
is separated from South America by a much narrower straight,
and there was trading contact across that straight
throughout 10,000 years.
The Tasmanians were isolated.
and ask yourself, not only who made it and for who,
but who knew how to make it.
In the case of the stone axe, the man who made it knew how to make it.
But who knows how to make a computer mouse?
Nobody, literally nobody.
There is nobody on the planet who knows how to make a computer mouse.
I mean this quite seriously.
The president of the computer mouse company doesn't know.
He just knows how to run a company.
The person on the assembly line doesn't know
because he doesn't know how to drill an oil well
to get oil out to make plastic, and so on.
We all know little bits, but none of us knows the whole.
by Leonard Read, the economist in the 1950s,
called "I, Pencil"
in which he wrote about how a pencil came to be made,
and how nobody knows even how to make a pencil,
because the people who assemble it don't know how to mine graphite,
and they don't know how to fell trees and that kind of thing.
And what we've done in human society,
through exchange and specialization,
is we've created
the ability to do things that we don't even understand.
It's not the same with language.
With language we have to transfer ideas
that we understand with each other.
But with technology,
we can actually do things that are beyond our capabilities.
to an extraordinary degree.
And by the way,
that's one of the reasons that I'm not interested
in the debate about I.Q.,
about whether some groups have higher I.Q.s than other groups.
It's completely irrelevant.
What's relevant to a society
is how well people are communicating their ideas,
and how well they're cooperating,
not how clever the individuals are.
So we've created something called the collective brain.
We're just the nodes in the network.
We're the neurons in this brain.
It's the interchange of ideas,
the meeting and mating of ideas between them,
that is causing technological progress,
incrementally, bit by bit.
However, bad things happen.
And in the future, as we go forward,
we will, of course, experience terrible things.
There will be wars; there will be depressions;
there will be natural disasters.
Awful things will happen in this century, I'm absolutely sure.
But I'm also sure that, because of the connections people are making,
and the ability of ideas
to meet and to mate
as never before,
I'm also sure
that technology will advance,
and therefore living standards will advance.
Because through the cloud,
through crowd sourcing,
through the bottom-up world that we've created,
where not just the elites but everybody
is able to have their ideas
and make them meet and mate,
we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation.
no matter where I am,
I sort of see slicks,
I wound up studying sea birds
to try to stay in the coastal habitats that I so loved.
It's like you dipped a marble in water.
And the same thing with the atmosphere:
So the blowout in the Gulf
Beyond warming,
we have the problem of the oceans getting more acidified --
it dissolves in about three days.
it becomes deformed and dies.
And they can handle water.
because there isn't one in their community.
It looks like you just emptied the oil pan in your car,
and you just dumped it in the ocean.
And one of the really most incredible things, I think,
at the site where it is densest.
there's still people using the beach
while there are people cleaning up the beach.
And they have a very strange way of cleaning up the beach.
they're getting tar all over their clothes and their sandals--
They are very hardworking people.
and signs of their grief.
Some people say there are not oil plumes.
But I couldn't take a submarine ride --
to see if there was oil in the Gulf of Mexico.
you can't touch, you can't extract
and, I think most importantly -- this is what I think --
you can't see it.
I think it's being hidden on purpose.
Now this is such a catastrophe and such a mess
there's a large attempt to suppress what's going on.
and then it is attacked,
because they don't want the evidence, in my opinion.
We heard that bacteria eat oil?
So do sea turtles.
Turtles eat it. It gets in the gills of fish.
These guys have to swim around through it.
A writer named Ted Williams called me,
took him out to show him what's going on.
He has no bookings left.
Everybody wanted their deposit back, everybody is fleeing.
That's the story of thousands of people.
and he knew that the dolphins scare fish.
it was right next to the side of the boat again.
Their numbers have never recovered.
It's going to take longer for some things.
The other thing about the Gulf that is important
So the Gulf is a really important piece of water --
These tuna swim the entire ocean.
a catastrophic spawning season this year.
I don't know what this kind of stuff will do in their gills.
I don't know if it'll affect the adults.
I think it's important to keep in mind
that concentrate in the Gulf at certain times of the year,
but then leave.
And they populate much larger areas.
They breed in the High Arctic,
and they winter down in southern South America.
So this is a hemispheric issue.
The biological effects are certainly hemispheric.
They get near shore -- Look at these two boats.
That one on the right is called Fishing Fool.
And I think, you know, that's a great name
for boats that think that they're going to do anything
to make a dent in this, by dragging a boom between them
So it's just absolutely crazy.
Here are shrimp boats employed.
You can see easily
hundreds and hundreds of miles of shoreline --
all of the shoreline that has booms,
there's adjacent shoreline that doesn't have any booms.
really what I think they should do, if anything --
they're trying so hard to protect those nests --
actually, if they destroyed every single nest,
some of the birds would leave,
and that would be better for them this year.
But really, where are those birds going to get released to?
I think that this is the result of gross negligence.
And they were allowed to do so
It turns out that --
you see this sign on every commercial vessel in the United States --
and who has gotten above the laws.
that after making 30,000 holes
in the sea floor of the Gulf of Mexico looking for oil,
But in the entire rest of government right now
and for the last at least 30 years,
there has been a culture of deregulation
That's what it would really mean to be conservative.
that really has been lost.
I think there are signs of hope.
after the legislation has just passed.
So it's a continued fight.
It's a historic moment right now.
of this oil leak in the Gulf,
or we will make the moment we need out of this,
as many people have noted today.
There's certainly a common theme
about needing to make the moment out of this.
The first offshore wells were called whales.
The first offshore drills were called harpoons.
We emptied the ocean of the whales at that time.
Who says it's too expensive?
People who sell us fossil fuels.
We've been here before with energy,
because the cheapest energy was slavery.
Energy is always a moral issue.
It's an issue that is moral right now.
But I didn't start out obsessed with food.
I started out obsessed with global security policy,
and I'm assuming the rest of the world is too.
and your whole neighborhood is hungry.
which is education, the first step out of poverty,
a year's worth of school meals for one kid.
It's so simple, and we thought, OK,
for the World Food Programme.
But at the UN, sometimes things move slowly
and here's a screenshot of our website.
We did a bag for Haiti just a month after the earthquake
to provide school meals for kids in Haiti.
because what we think about is eating.
and talking about international issues
but it's incredibly important to address hunger in our own country.
But the bigger problem that we all know about is obesity,
It's actually been spreading all around the world
and mainly through our kind of food systems that we're exporting.
The numbers are pretty crazy.
There's a billion people obese or overweight
but I kind of started to think about, you know,
Agriculture in America's very interesting.
It's very consolidated
and the foods that are produced lead to the foods that we eat.
Unfortunately, in our agricultural system,
that will help feed people all around the world.
and that really didn't help me understand farming,
but I think it's a really cool picture.
are pretty large in general.
And their farms are also large.
Most hungry people in the world are subsistence farmers.
And most of those people are women --
when, you know -- mass consolidation,
mass exodus of small farmers in this country.
And then in the same time period,
we've kind of left Africa's farmers to do their own thing.
Hello! You don't put soda in bottles.
But people do, because it's so cheap,
but really we're exporting the system around the world,
and when you look at the data of least developed countries --
especially in cities, which are growing really rapidly --
people are eating American processed foods.
and people from all around the world are importing our food system,
but apparently, it really takes 30 years
for a lot of technologies to become really endemic to us,
like the mouse and the Internet and Windows.
You know, there's 30-year cycles.
I think 2010 can be a really interesting year
because it is the end of the 30-year cycle,
and it's the birthday of the global food system.
the farm crisis in America
and the change in how we've addressed agriculture internationally.
I'm not the only one who's obsessed with this whole 30-year thing.
both addressed this last three-decade time period
as incredibly relevant for food system change.
Well, I really care about 1980
because it's also the 30th anniversary of me this year.
And so in my lifetime,
a lot of what's happened in the world --
as a time to change the food system again.
And we know what's happened in the past,
so if we start now and we look at technologies
and improvements to the food system long-term,
we might be able to recreate the food system
and domestic advocates that are addressing obesity,
we might actually look for long-term solutions
that will make the food system better for everyone.
So I'm hoping that by connecting really disparate organizations
like the ONE campaign and Slow Food,
which don't seem right now to have much in common,
we can talk about holistic, long-term, systemic solutions
that will improve food for everyone.
and so do kids in Botswana.
And how are we going to get those kids those nutritious foods?
Understanding how to produce protein
And, you know, these are really relevant topics
that are long-term and important
for both people in Africa who are small farmers
where we actually price the negative externalities
because the choices are actually choices
and I've gathered a coalition of a few organizations to start.
And it'll be growing over the next few months.
But I really hope that you will all think of ways
Trees epitomize stasis.
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place
for many human generations,
but if we shift our perspective
from the trunk to the twigs,
trees become very dynamic entities,
moving and growing.
And I decided to explore this movement
by turning trees into artists.
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig.
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas,
and that produced art.
The piece of art you see on your left
is painted by a western red cedar
and that on your right by a Douglas fir,
and what I learned was that different species
have different signatures, like a Picasso versus a Monet.
and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it,
so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree --
which produced this painting -- moved in a single year,
I simply measured and summed
each of those lines.
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch
and the number of branches per tree
and then divided that by the number of minutes per year.
And so I was able to calculate
how far a single tree moved in a single year.
You might have a guess.
The answer is actually 186,540 miles,
or seven times around the globe.
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk
to the many dynamic twigs,
we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities,
but rather extremely dynamic.
we might consider this lesson of trees,
to consider other entities that are also static and stuck,
but which cry for change and dynamicism,
and one of those entities is our prisons.
Prisons, of course, are where people who break our laws
are stuck, confined behind bars.
And our prison system itself is stuck.
The United States has over 2.3 million
incarcerated men and women.
That number is rising.
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released,
60 will return to prison.
Funds for education, for training
and for rehabilitation are declining,
so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues.
I decided to ask whether the lesson
I had learned from trees as artists
could be applied to a static institution
such as our prisons,
and I think the answer is yes.
I started a partnership
with the Washington State Department of Corrections.
Working with four prisons, we began bringing science and scientists,
sustainability and conservation projects
to four state prisons.
We give science lectures,
and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures
instead of watching television or weightlifting.
That, I think, is movement.
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy
for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center
to grow endangered prairie plants
for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state.
That, I think, is movement.
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife
to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog --
for later release into protected wetlands.
That, I think, is movement.
those men who are segregated
in what we call Supermax facilities.
They've incurred violent infractions
by becoming violent with guards
and with other prisoners.
They're kept in bare cells like this
for 23 hours a day.
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals,
they're placed in immobile booths like this.
For one hour a day
they're brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards.
Although we can't bring trees and prairie plants
and frogs into these environments,
we are bringing images of nature
into these exercise yards,
putting them on the walls, so at least they get contact
with visual images of nature.
This is Mr. Lopez, who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months,
and he's providing input on the types of images
that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates
more serene, more calm,
less apt to violence.
is that small, collective movements of change
can perhaps move
an entity such as our own prison system
in a direction of hope.
We know that trees are static entities
when we look at their trunks.
But if trees can create art,
if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year,
if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs,
then perhaps there are other static entities
that we hold inside ourselves,
like grief, like addictions,
like racism,
that can also change.
I still remember the day in school
when our teacher told us
that the world population had become
three billion people,
and that was in 1960.
I'm going to talk now about
how world population has changed from that year
and into the future,
but I will not use digital technology,
as I've done during my first five TEDTalks.
Instead, I have progressed,
and I am, today, launching
a brand new analog teaching technology
that I picked up from IKEA:
this box.
And our teacher told us
that the industrialized world, 1960,
had one billion people.
In the developing world, she said,
they had two billion people.
And they lived away then.
There was a big gap between
the one billion in the industrialized world
and the two billion in the developing world.
In the industrialized world,
people were healthy,
educated, rich,
and they had small families.
And their aspiration
was to buy a car.
And in 1960, all Swedes were saving
to try to buy a Volvo like this.
This was the economic level at which Sweden was.
But in contrast to this,
in the developing world, far away,
the aspiration of the average family there
was to have food for the day.
They were saving
to be able to buy a pair of shoes.
There was an enormous gap in the world
when I grew up.
And this gap between the West and the rest
has created a mindset of the world,
which we still use linguistically
when we talk about "the West"
and "the Developing World."
But the world has changed,
and it's overdue to upgrade that mindset
and that taxonomy of the world, and to understand it.
because since 1960
what has happened in the world up to 2010
is that a staggering
four billion people
have been added to the world population.
Just look how many.
The world population has doubled
since I went to school.
And of course, there's been economic growth in the West.
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy,
so the Western population moved over to here.
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car.
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination
and they want to fly.
So this is where they are today.
And the most successful of the developing countries,
they have moved on, you know,
and they have become emerging economies, we call them.
They are now buying cars.
And what happened a month ago
was that the Chinese company, Geely,
they acquired the Volvo company,
and then finally the Swedes understood that
something big had happened in the world.
(Laughter)
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here
that is struggling for food and shoes,
they are still almost as poor
as they were 50 years ago.
The new thing is that
we have the biggest pile of billions, the three billions here,
which are also becoming emerging economies,
because they are quite healthy, relatively well-educated,
and they already also have two to three children
per woman, as those [richer also] have.
And their aspiration now
is, of course, to buy a bicycle,
and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also.
But this is the world
we have today,
no longer any gap.
But the distance from the poorest here, the very poorest,
to the very richest over here is wider than ever.
But there is a continuous world
from walking, biking,
driving, flying --
there are people on all levels,
and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle.
This is the new world we have today
in 2010.
Well, I'm going to project
into 2050.
I was in Shanghai recently,
and I listened to what's happening in China,
and it's pretty sure that they will catch up,
just as Japan did.
All the projections [say that] this one [billion] will [only] grow with
one to two or three percent.
[But this second] grows with seven, eight percent, and then they will end up here.
They will start flying.
And these
lower or middle income countries, the emerging income countries,
they will also forge forwards economically.
And if,
but only if,
we invest in the right green technology --
so that we can avoid severe climate change,
and energy can still be relatively cheap --
then they will move all the way up here.
And they will start to buy
electric cars.
This is what we will find there.
What about the poorest two billion here?
Will they move on?
Well, here population [growth] comes in
because there [among emerging economies] we already have two to three children per woman,
family planning is widely used,
and population growth is coming to an end.
Here [among the poorest], population is growing.
So these [poorest] two billion will, in the next decades,
increase to three billion,
and they will thereafter
increase to four billion.
There is nothing --
but a nuclear war of a kind we've never seen --
that can stop this [growth] from happening.
Because we already have this [growth] in process.
But if, and only if,
[the poorest] get out of poverty,
they get education, they get improved child survival,
they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come [to live] here,
then population growth
will stop in 2050.
We cannot have people on this level
looking for food and shoes
because then we get continued population growth.
by converting back to the old-time
digital technology.
Here I have on the screen
my country bubbles.
Every bubble is a country. The size is population.
The colors show the continent.
The yellow on there is the Americas;
dark blue is Africa; brown is Europe;
green is the Middle East
and this light blue is South Asia.
That's India and this is China. Size is population.
Here I have children per woman:
two children, four children, six children, eight children --
big families, small families.
The year is 1960.
And down here, child survival,
the percentage of children surviving childhood
up to starting school:
60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent, 90,
and almost 100 percent, as we have today
in the wealthiest and healthiest countries.
But look, this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960:
one billion Western world here --
high child-survival, small families --
and all the rest,
the rainbow of developing countries,
with very large families
and poor child survival.
Can you see, as the years pass by, child survival is increasing?
They get soap, hygiene, education,
vaccination, penicillin
and then family planning. Family size is decreasing.
[When] they get up to 90-percent child survival, then families decrease,
and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East
is falling down there [to small families].
Look, Bangladesh catching up with India.
The whole emerging world
joins the Western world
with good child survival
and small family size,
but we still have the poorest billion.
Can you see the poorest billion,
those [two] boxes I had over here?
They are still up here.
And they still have a child survival
of only 70 to 80 percent,
meaning that if you have six children born,
there will be at least four who survive
to the next generation.
And the population will double in one generation.
of really getting world population [growth] to stop
is to continue to improve child survival
to 90 percent.
That's why investments by Gates Foundation,
UNICEF and aid organizations,
together with national government in the poorest countries,
are so good;
because they are actually
helping us to reach
a sustainable population size of the world.
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things.
Child survival is the new green.
It's only by child survival
that we will stop population growth.
And will it happen?
Well, I'm not an optimist,
neither am I a pessimist.
I'm a very serious "possibilist."
It's a new category where we take emotion apart,
and we just work analytically with the world.
It can be done.
We can have a much more just world.
With green technology
and with investments to alleviate poverty,
and global governance,
the world can become like this.
Remember when this blue box was all alone,
leading the world, living its own life.
This will not happen [again].
The role of the old West in the new world
is to become the foundation
of the modern world --
nothing more, nothing less.
But it's a very important role.
Do it well and get used to it.
Thank you very much.
Please excuse me for sitting; I'm very old.
(Laughter)
Well, the topic I'm going to discuss
is one which is, in a certain sense, very peculiar
because it's very old.
Roughness is part of human life
forever and forever,
and ancient authors have written about it.
It was very much uncontrollable,
and in a certain sense,
it seemed to be the extreme of complexity,
just a mess, a mess and a mess.
There are many different kinds of mess.
Now, in fact,
by a complete fluke,
I got involved many years ago
in a study of this form of complexity,
and to my utter amazement,
I found traces --
very strong traces, I must say --
of order in that roughness.
And so today, I would like to present to you
a few examples
of what this represents.
I prefer the word roughness
to the word irregularity
because irregularity --
to someone who had Latin
in my long-past youth --
means the contrary of regularity.
But it is not so.
Regularity is the contrary of roughness
because the basic aspect of the world
is very rough.
Some of them are artificial.
Others of them are very real, in a certain sense.
Now this is the real. It's a cauliflower.
Now why do I show a cauliflower,
a very ordinary and ancient vegetable?
Because old and ancient as it may be,
it's very complicated and it's very simple,
both at the same time.
If you try to weigh it -- of course it's very easy to weigh it,
and when you eat it, the weight matters --
but suppose you try to
measure its surface.
Well, it's very interesting.
If you cut, with a sharp knife,
one of the florets of a cauliflower
and look at it separately,
you think of a whole cauliflower, but smaller.
And then you cut again,
again, again, again, again, again, again, again, again,
and you still get small cauliflowers.
So the experience of humanity
has always been that there are some shapes
which have this peculiar property,
that each part is like the whole,
but smaller.
Now, what did humanity do with that?
Very, very little.
(Laughter)
study this problem,
and I found something quite surprising.
That one can measure roughness
by a number, a number,
2.3, 1.2 and sometimes much more.
One day, a friend of mine,
to bug me,
brought a picture and said,
"What is the roughness of this curve?"
I said, "Well, just short of 1.5."
It was 1.48.
Now, it didn't take me any time.
I've been looking at these things for so long.
So these numbers are the numbers
which denote the roughness of these surfaces.
I hasten to say that these surfaces
are completely artificial.
They were done on a computer,
and the only input is a number,
and that number is roughness.
So on the left,
I took the roughness copied from many landscapes.
To the right, I took a higher roughness.
So the eye, after a while,
can distinguish these two very well.
This is very rough, and this is sort of smooth, and this perfectly smooth.
Very few things are very smooth.
So then if you try to ask questions:
"What's the surface of a cauliflower?"
Well, you measure and measure and measure.
Each time you're closer, it gets bigger,
down to very, very small distances.
What's the length of the coastline
of these lakes?
The closer you measure, the longer it is.
The concept of length of coastline,
which seems to be so natural
because it's given in many cases,
is, in fact, complete fallacy; there's no such thing.
You must do it differently.
Well, surprisingly enough,
it's good in many ways.
To begin with, artificial landscapes,
which I invented sort of,
are used in cinema all the time.
We see mountains in the distance.
They may be mountains, but they may be just formulae, just cranked on.
Now it's very easy to do.
It used to be very time-consuming, but now it's nothing.
Now look at that. That's a real lung.
Now a lung is something very strange.
If you take this thing,
you know very well it weighs very little.
The volume of a lung is very small,
but what about the area of the lung?
Anatomists were arguing very much about that.
Some say that a normal male's lung
has an area of the inside
of a basketball [court].
And the others say, no, five basketball [courts].
Enormous disagreements.
Why so? Because, in fact, the area of the lung
is something very ill-defined.
The bronchi branch, branch, branch
and they stop branching,
not because of any matter of principle,
but because of physical considerations:
the mucus, which is in the lung.
So what happens is that in a way
you have a much bigger lung,
but it branches and branches
down to distances about the same for a whale, for a man
and for a little rodent.
Well, surprisingly enough, amazingly enough,
the anatomists had a very poor idea
of the structure of the lung until very recently.
And I think that my mathematics,
surprisingly enough,
has been of great help
to the surgeons
studying lung illnesses
and also kidney illnesses,
all these branching systems,
for which there was no geometry.
So I found myself, in other words,
constructing a geometry,
a geometry of things which had no geometry.
And a surprising aspect of it
is that very often, the rules of this geometry
are extremely short.
You have formulas that long.
And you crank it several times.
Sometimes repeatedly: again, again, again,
the same repetition.
And at the end, you get things like that.
100 percent artificial.
Well, 99.9.
And the only part which is natural
is a number, the roughness of the cloud,
which is taken from nature.
Something so complicated like a cloud,
so unstable, so varying,
should have a simple rule behind it.
Now this simple rule
is not an explanation of clouds.
The seer of clouds had to
take account of it.
I don't know how much advanced
these pictures are. They're old.
I was very much involved in it,
but then turned my attention to other phenomena.
which is rather interesting.
One of the shattering events
in the history of mathematics,
which is not appreciated by many people,
occurred about 130 years ago,
145 years ago.
Mathematicians began to create
shapes that didn't exist.
Mathematicians got into self-praise
to an extent which was absolutely amazing,
that man can invent things
that nature did not know.
In particular, it could invent
things like a curve which fills the plane.
A curve's a curve, a plane's a plane,
and the two won't mix.
Well, they do mix.
A man named Peano
did define such curves,
and it became an object of extraordinary interest.
It was very important, but mostly interesting
because a kind of break,
a separation between
the mathematics coming from reality, on the one hand,
and new mathematics coming from pure man's mind.
Well, I was very sorry to point out
that the pure man's mind
has, in fact,
seen at long last
what had been seen for a long time.
And so here I introduce something,
the set of rivers of a plane-filling curve.
And well,
it's a story unto itself.
So it was in 1875 to 1925,
an extraordinary period
in which mathematics prepared itself to break out from the world.
And the objects which were used
as examples, when I was
a child and a student, as examples
of the break between mathematics
and visible reality --
those objects,
I turned them completely around.
I used them for describing
some of the aspects of the complexity of nature.
introduced a number which was just a mathematical joke,
and I found that this number
was a good measurement of roughness.
When I first told it to my friends in mathematics
they said, "Don't be silly. It's just something [silly]."
Well actually, I was not silly.
The great painter Hokusai knew it very well.
The things on the ground are algae.
He did not know the mathematics; it didn't yet exist.
And he was Japanese who had no contact with the West.
But painting for a long time had a fractal side.
I could speak of that for a long time.
The Eiffel Tower has a fractal aspect.
I read the book that Mr. Eiffel wrote about his tower,
and indeed it was astonishing how much he understood.
One day I decided --
halfway through my career,
I was held by so many things in my work --
I decided to test myself.
Could I just look at something
which everybody had been looking at for a long time
and find something dramatically new?
Well, so I looked at these
things called Brownian motion -- just goes around.
I played with it for a while,
and I made it return to the origin.
Then I was telling my assistant,
"I don't see anything. Can you paint it?"
So he painted it, which means
he put inside everything. He said:
"Well, this thing came out ..." And I said, "Stop! Stop! Stop!
I see; it's an island."
And amazing.
So Brownian motion, which happens to have
a roughness number of two, goes around.
I measured it, 1.33.
Again, again, again.
Long measurements, big Brownian motions,
1.33.
Mathematical problem: how to prove it?
It took my friends 20 years.
Three of them were having incomplete proofs.
They got together, and together they had the proof.
So they got the big [Fields] medal in mathematics,
one of the three medals that people have received
for proving things which I've seen
without being able to prove them.
"How did it all start?
What got you in that strange business?"
What got you to be,
at the same time, a mechanical engineer,
a geographer
and a mathematician and so on, a physicist?
Well actually I started, oddly enough,
studying stock market prices.
And so here
I had this theory,
and I wrote books about it --
financial prices increments.
To the left you see data over a long period.
To the right, on top,
you see a theory which is very, very fashionable.
It was very easy, and you can write many books very fast about it.
(Laughter)
There are thousands of books on that.
Now compare that with real price increments.
Where are real price increments?
Well, these other lines
include some real price increments
and some forgery which I did.
So the idea there was
that one must be able to -- how do you say? --
model price variation.
And it went really well 50 years ago.
For 50 years, people were sort of pooh-poohing me
because they could do it much, much easier.
But I tell you, at this point, people listened to me.
(Laughter)
These two curves are averages:
Standard & Poor, the blue one;
and the red one is Standard & Poor's
from which the five biggest discontinuities
are taken out.
Now discontinuities are a nuisance,
so in many studies of prices,
one puts them aside.
"Well, acts of God.
And you have the little nonsense which is left.
Acts of God." In this picture,
five acts of God are as important as everything else.
In other words,
it is not acts of God that we should put aside.
That is the meat, the problem.
If you master these, you master price,
and if you don't master these, you can master
the little noise as well as you can,
but it's not important.
Well, here are the curves for it.
of which my name is attached.
In a way, it's the story of my life.
My adolescence was spent
during the German occupation of France.
Since I thought that I might
vanish within a day or a week,
I had very big dreams.
And after the war,
I saw an uncle again.
My uncle was a very prominent mathematician, and he told me,
"Look, there's a problem
which I could not solve 25 years ago,
and which nobody can solve.
This is a construction of a man named [Gaston] Julia
and [Pierre] Fatou.
If you could
find something new, anything,
you will get your career made."
Very simple.
So I looked,
and like the thousands of people that had tried before,
I found nothing.
and I decided to apply the computer,
not to new problems in mathematics --
like this wiggle wiggle, that's a new problem --
but to old problems.
And I went from what's called
real numbers, which are points on a line,
to imaginary, complex numbers,
which are points on a plane,
which is what one should do there,
and this shape came out.
This shape is of an extraordinary complication.
The equation is hidden there,
z goes into z squared, plus c.
It's so simple, so dry.
It's so uninteresting.
Now you turn the crank once, twice:
twice,
marvels come out.
I mean this comes out.
I don't want to explain these things.
This comes out. This comes out.
Shapes which are of such complication,
such harmony and such beauty.
This comes out
repeatedly, again, again, again.
And that was one of my major discoveries,
to find that these islands were the same
as the whole big thing, more or less.
And then you get these
extraordinary baroque decorations all over the place.
All that from this little formula,
which has whatever, five symbols in it.
And then this one.
The color was added for two reasons.
First of all, because these shapes
are so complicated
that one couldn't make any sense of the numbers.
And if you plot them, you must choose some system.
And so my principle has been
to always present the shapes
with different colorings
because some colorings emphasize that,
and others it is that or that.
It's so complicated.
to receive a prize from the university,
and three days later,
a pilot was flying over the landscape and found this thing.
So where did this come from?
Obviously, from extraterrestrials.
(Laughter)
Well, so the newspaper in Cambridge
published an article about that "discovery"
and received the next day
5,000 letters from people saying,
"But that's simply a Mandelbrot set very big."
This shape here just came
out of an exercise in pure mathematics.
Bottomless wonders spring from simple rules,
which are repeated without end.
Why grow homes? Because we can.
Right now, America is in an unremitting state of trauma.
And there's a cause for that, all right.
We've got McPeople, McCars, McHouses.
As an architect, I have to confront something like this.
to make ginormous houses?
Well, it's been around for 2,500 years.
It's called pleaching, or grafting trees together,
or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous, vascular system.
And we do something different
than what we did in the past;
we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that.
We use CNC to make scaffolding
to train semi-epithetic matter, plants,
into a specific geometry
that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab.
It fits into the environment. It is the environment.
It is the landscape, right?
and it's great because they suck carbon.
They're perfect.
You can have 100 million families, or take things out of the suburbs,
because these are homes that are a part of the environment.
Imagine pre-growing a village --
it takes about seven to 10 years --
and everything is green.
we also do the in-vitro meat habitat,
or homes that we're doing research on now in Brooklyn,
where, as an architecture office, we're for the first of its kind
to put in a molecular cell biology lab
and start experimenting with regenerative medicine
and tissue engineering
and start thinking about what the future would be
if architecture and biology became one.
And what we do is we grow
extracellular matrix from pigs.
We use a modified inkjet printer,
and we print geometry.
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects
like, you know, shoes, leather belts,
handbags, etc.,
where no sentient creature is harmed.
It's victimless. It's meat from a test tube.
So our theory is that eventually
we should be doing this with homes.
an architectural construction,
and this is a section
of our proposal for a meat house,
where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation,
cilia for dealing with wind loads
and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows.
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial,
but we kind of chose this shape.
And there it is kind of grown, at least one particular section of it.
and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral
so religion can confront the house of meat.
That's why we grow homes. Thanks very much.
It's a great honor today
to share with you
The Digital Universe,
which was created for humanity
to really see where we are
in the universe.
And so I think we can roll the video that we have.
has been a metaphor for the
infinite: unbounded resources
and unlimited capacity
for disposal of waste.
It wasn't until we really
left Earth,
got above the atmosphere
and had seen the horizon
bend back on itself,
that we could understand our planet
as a limited condition.
The Digital Universe Atlas
has been built
at the American Museum of Natural History
over the past 12 years.
We maintain that,
put that together
as a project
to really chart the universe
across all scales.
What we see here are satellites around the Earth

our main space shows in the dome.
But what you see here
is the result of, actually, internships
that we hosted with Linkoping University
in Sweden.
I've had 12 students work on this
for their graduate work,
and the result has been this software called Uniview
and a company called SCISS in Sweden.
This software
allows interactive use,
so this actual flight path
and movie that we see here
was actually flown live.
I captured this live from my laptop
in a cafe called Earth Matters
on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, where I live,
and it was done
as a collaborative project
with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art
for an exhibit
on comparative cosmology.
we see continuously from our planet
all the way out into the realm of galaxies, as we see here,
light-travel time, giving you a sense of how far away we are.
As we move out,
the light from these distant galaxies
have taken so long,
we're essentially backing up into the past.
We back so far up
we're finally seeing a containment around us --
the afterglow of the Big Bang.
This is the WMAP
microwave background
that we see.
We'll fly outside it here, just to see this sort of containment.
If we were outside this,
it would almost be meaningless, in the sense as before time.
But this our containment of the visible universe.
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see.
we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning,
but these are positions,
the latest positions of exoplanets
that we've mapped,
and our sun here, obviously, with our own solar system.
What you're going to see -- we're going to have to jump in here pretty quickly
between several orders of magnitude
to get down to where we see the solar system --
these are the paths of
Voyager 1, Voyager 2, Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10,
the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system.
Coming in closer,
picking up Earth,
orbit of the Moon, and we see the Earth.
This map can be updated,
and we can add in new data.

But here we see the complex trajectory
of the Cassini mission
color coded for different mission phases,
ingeniously developed so that
45 encounters with the largest moon, Titan,
which is larger that the planet Mercury,
diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase.

This software can also be networked between domes.
We have a growing user base of this,
and we network domes.
And we can network between domes and classrooms.
We're actually sharing tours of the universe

as well as
new libraries that have been built
in the ghettos in Columbia
and a high school
in Cambodia.
And the Cambodians have
actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school.

So you're seeing the edge of the Earth.
This is Nepal.
This is, in fact, right here is the valley of Lhasa,
right here in Tibet.
But we can see the haze
from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley
down below in India.
This is Nepal and Tibet.
I'd just like to say this beautiful world that we live on --
here we see a bit of the snow
that some of you may have had to brave in coming out --
so I'd like to just say
that what the world needs now
is a sense of being able to
look at ourselves in this much larger condition now
and a much larger sense of what home is.
Because our home is the universe,
and we are the universe, essentially.
We carry that in us.
And to be able to see our context
in this larger sense at all scales
helps us all, I think, in understanding
where we are and who we are in the universe.
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,
but what I'm going to try to say is that
even in that complexity,
there's some simple themes that I think,
if we understand, we can really move forward.
And those simple themes aren't really
themes about the complex science of what's going on,
but things that we all pretty well know.
And I'm going to start with this one:
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.
We know that, right? We've experienced that.
And if we just take that
and we build from there,
then we can go to the next step,
which is that if the ocean ain't happy,
ain't nobody happy.
That's the theme of my talk.
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.
Cannery Row, at the time,
had the biggest industrial
canning operation on the west coast.
We piled enormous amounts of pollution
into the air and into the water.
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor
at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,
wrote in the 1940s that
"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay
were so bad they turned
lead-based paints black."
People working in these canneries
could barely stay there all day because of the smell,
but you know what they came out saying?
They say, "You know what you smell?
You smell money."
That pollution was money to that community,
and those people dealt with the pollution
and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies
because they needed the money.
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,
and we made them unhealthy.
is actually based upon another couple simple adages,
and I want to call that
"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."
The pyramid of ocean life ...
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --
we look at the ocean in a very different way,
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean
because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,
we see all those interconnections.
We see the base of the food chain,
the plankton, the small things,
and we see how those animals
are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,
and on so up this diagram.
And that flow, that flow of life,
from the very base up to the very top,
is the flow that ecologists see.
And that's what we're trying to preserve
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."
It's that pyramid.
Because when we jam things in the bottom
of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,
some very frightening things happen.
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:
molecules like PCBs
that can't be broken down by our bodies.
And they go in the base of that pyramid,
and they drift up; they're passed up that way,
on to predators and on to the top predators,
and in so doing,
they accumulate.
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.
Imagine that when we got on this boat,
we were all given
two Styrofoam peanuts.
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,
you give them the drink,
and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts
will start moving through our society here,
and they will accumulate in
the drunkest, stingiest people.
(Laughter)
There's no mechanism in this game
for them to go anywhere but into
a bigger and bigger pile
of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs
in this food pyramid:
They accumulate into the top of it.
we take these lovely little chocolates that we get
and we had those instead.
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates
instead of passing them around,
and instead of accumulating,
they will just pass into our group here
and not accumulate in any one group
because they're absorbed by us.
And that's the difference between a PCB
and, say, something natural like an omega-3,
something we want out of the marine food chain.
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.
PCBs accumulate in dolphins
in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.
They get into the food chain.
The dolphins eat the fish
that have PCBs from the plankton,
and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,
accumulate in these dolphins.
Now, a dolphin,
mother dolphin, any dolphin --
there's only one way
that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.
And what's that?
In mother's milk.
Here's a diagram of the PCB load
of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.
Adult males: a huge load.
Juveniles: a huge load.
Females after their first calf is already weaned:
a lower load.
Those females, they're not trying to.
Those females are passing the PCBs
in the fat of their own mother's milk
into their offspring,
and their offspring don't survive.
The death rate in these dolphins,
for the first calf born of every female dolphin,
is 60 to 80 percent.
These mothers pump their first offspring
full of this pollutant,
and most of them die.
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,
but what a terrible price to pay
for the accumulation of this pollutant
in these animals --
the death of the first-born calf.
That top predator, of course, is us.
And we also are eating meat
that comes from some of these same places.
This is whale meat
that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --
or is it?
In fact, what we did a few years ago
was learn how to smuggle
a molecular biology lab into Tokyo
and use it to genetically test the DNA
out of whale meat samples
and identify what they really were.
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.
That's another story.
But some of them were not whale meat at all.
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.
And those dolphin parts
had a huge load of PCBs,
dioxins and heavy metals.
And that huge load was passing into the people
that ate this meat.
It turns out that a lot of dolphins
are being sold as meat
in the whale meat market around the world.
That's a tragedy for those populations,
but it's also a tragedy
for the people eating them
because they don't know that that's toxic meat.
I remember sitting at my desk
being about the only person in the world
who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets
was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads
ever allowed by the EPA.
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,
"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"
but it was so awful.
And for the very first time in my scientific career,
I broke scientific protocol,
which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals
and then begin to talk about them.
We sent a very polite letter
to the Minister of Health in Japan
and simply pointed out that
this is an intolerable situation, not for us,
but for the people of Japan
because mothers who may be breastfeeding,
who may have young children,
would be buying something that they thought was healthy,
but it was really toxic.
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,
and I'm really proud to say that at this point,
it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan
that's labeled incorrectly,
even though they're still selling whale meat,
which I believe they shouldn't.
But at least it's labeled correctly,
and you're no longer going to be buying
toxic dolphin meat instead.
but in a natural diet of some communities
in the Canadian arctic and in the United States
and in the European arctic,
a natural diet of seals and whales
leads to an accumulation of PCBs
that have gathered up from all parts of the world
and ended up in these women.
These women have toxic breast milk.
They cannot feed their offspring, their children,
their breast milk
because of the accumulation of these toxins
in their food chain,
in their part of the world's
ocean pyramid.
That means their immune systems are compromised.
It means that their children's development
can be compromised.
And the world's attention on this over the last decade
has reduced the problem
for these women,
not by changing the pyramid,
but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid
in order to solve this problem.
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,
but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,
can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer
in the base of that food pyramid,
it can back up all through it.
We end up with things we've heard about before:
red tides, for example,
which are blooms of toxic algae
floating through the oceans
causing neurological damage.
We can also see blooms of bacteria,
blooms of viruses in the ocean.
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here
and a bacteria
in the genus vibrio,
which includes the genus that has cholera in it.
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?
Why does that happen?
It happens because we have jammed so much
into the base of the natural ocean pyramid
that these bacteria clog it up
and overfill onto our beaches.
Often what jams us up is sewage.
where you had a big sign at the front saying,
"Closed because human sewage
is so far over this park
that you can't use it"?
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.
We wouldn't tolerate our parks
being swamped by human sewage,
but beaches are closed a lot in our country.
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.
It's not just a question of cleanliness;
it's also a question of
how those organisms
then turn into human disease.
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.
showing the rise of the infections
by vibrio in people
over the last few years.
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.
And if you can see on some surfing sites,
in fact, not only do you see
what the waves are like or what the weather's like,
but on some surf rider sites,
you see a little flashing poo alert.
That means that the beach might have great waves,
but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be
because they can carry with them,
even after a great day of surfing,
this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.
Some of these infections are actually carrying
antibiotic resistance genes now,
and that makes them even more difficult.
create harmful algal blooms.
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons
that come out of these harmful algal blooms:
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.
These are things that are getting into our food chain
because of these blooms.
Rita Calwell very famously
traced a very interesting story
of cholera into human communities,
brought there, not by
a normal human vector,
but by a marine vector, this copepod.
Copepods are small crustaceans.
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,
and they can carry on their little legs
some of the cholera bacteria
that then leads to human disease.
That has sparked cholera epidemics
in ports along the world
and has led to increased concentration
on trying to make sure shipping
doesn't move these
vectors of cholera around the world.
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow
that the pyramid may not be working so well,
that the flow from the base up into it
is being blocked and clogged.
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.
And he could come in
and fix the flow.
But in fact, if you look around the world,
not only are there hope spots
for where we may be able to fix problems,
there have been places where problems have been fixed,
where people have come to grips with these issues
and begun to turn them around.
Monterey is one of those.
we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem
with pollution and the canning industry
and all of the attendant problems.
In 1932, that's the picture.
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.
But there's a greater sense here
that what the individual communities need
is working ecosystems.
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.
And that pyramid
in Monterey, right now,
because of the efforts of a lot of different people,
is functioning better than it's ever functioned
for the last 150 years.
It happened because many people put their time and effort
and their pioneering spirit into this.
On the left there, Julia Platt,
the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.
At 74 years old, became mayor
because something had to be done
to protect the ocean.
In 1931, she produced California's first
community-based marine protected area,
right next to the biggest polluting cannery,
because Julia knew
that when the canneries eventually were gone,
the ocean needed a place to grow from,
that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,
and she wanted to provide that seed.
who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium
to lock into people's notion
that the ocean
and the health of the ocean ecosystem
were just as important to the economy of this area
as eating the ecosystem would be.
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,
not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,
but other places around the world.
what we're really trying to do here
is protect this ocean pyramid,
and that ocean pyramid
connects to our own pyramid of life.
It's an ocean planet,
and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,
but the pyramid of life in the ocean
and our own lives on land
are intricately connected.
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy
that we can remain healthy ourselves.
In the last 50 years,
we've been building the suburbs
with a lot of unintended consequences.
And I'm going to talk about some of those consequences
and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects
that I think give us tremendous reasons
to be really optimistic
that the big design and development project of the next 50 years
is going to be retrofitting suburbia.
So whether it's redeveloping dying malls
or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores
or reconstructing wetlands
out of parking lots,
I think the fact is
the growing number
of empty and under-performing,
especially retail, sites
throughout suburbia
gives us actually a tremendous opportunity
to take our least-sustainable
landscapes right now
and convert them into
more sustainable places.
And in the process, what that allows us to do
is to redirect a lot more of our growth
back into existing communities
that could use a boost,
and have the infrastructure in place,
instead of continuing
to tear down trees
and to tear up the green space out at the edges.
I think there are any number of reasons,
and I'm just going to not get into detail but mention a few.
Just from the perspective of climate change,
the average urban dweller in the U.S.
has about one-third the carbon footprint
of the average suburban dweller,
mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more,
and living in detached buildings,
you have that much more exterior surface
to leak energy out of.
So strictly from
a climate change perspective,
the cities are already
relatively green.
The big opportunity
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
is actually in urbanizing
the suburbs.
All that driving that we've been doing out in the suburbs,
we have doubled the amount of miles we drive.
It's increased our dependence
on foreign oil
despite the gains in fuel efficiency.
We're just driving so much more;
we haven't been able to keep up technologically.
to consider retrofitting.
Researchers at the CDC and other places
have increasingly been linking
suburban development patterns
with sedentary lifestyles.
And those have been linked then
with the rather alarming,
growing rates of obesity,
shown in these maps here,
and that obesity has also been triggering
great increases in heart disease
and diabetes
to the point where a child born today
has a one-in-three chance
of developing diabetes.
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate
as children not walking
to school anymore,
again, because of our development patterns.
I mean, how affordable is it
to continue to live in suburbia
with rising gas prices?
Suburban expansion to cheap land,
for the last 50 years --
you know the cheap land out on the edge --
has helped generations of families
enjoy the American dream.
But increasingly,
the savings promised
by drive-till-you-qualify affordability --
which is basically our model --
those savings are wiped out
when you consider the transportation costs.
For instance, here in Atlanta,
about half of households
make between $20,000 and $50,000 a year,
and they are spending 29 percent of their income
on housing
and 32 percent
on transportation.
I mean, that's 2005 figures.
That's before we got up to the four bucks a gallon.
You know, none of us
really tend to do the math on our transportation costs,
and they're not going down
any time soon.
or you hate its soulless commercial strips,
there are reasons why it's important to retrofit.
But is it practical?
I think it is.
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic
for over a decade,
and we've found over 80
varied projects.
But that they're really all market driven,
and what's driving the market in particular --
number one -- is major demographic shifts.
We all tend to think of suburbia
as this very family-focused place,
but that's really not the case anymore.
Since 2000,
already two-thirds of households in suburbia
did not have kids in them.
We just haven't caught up with the actual realities of this.
The reasons for this have a lot to with
the dominance of the two big
demographic groups right now:
the Baby Boomers retiring --
and then there's a gap,
Generation X, which is a small generation.
They're still having kids --
but Generation Y hasn't even started
hitting child-rearing age.
They're the other big generation.
demographers predict
that through 2025,
75 to 85 percent of new households
will not have kids in them.
And the market research, consumer research,
asking the Boomers and Gen Y
what it is they would like,
what they would like to live in,
tells us there is going to be a huge demand --
and we're already seeing it --
for more urban lifestyles
within suburbia.
That basically, the Boomers want to be able to age in place,
and Gen Y would like to live
an urban lifestyle,
but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia.
is the sheer performance of
underperforming asphalt.
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name
for an indie rock band,
but developers generally use it
to refer to underused parking lots --
and suburbia is full of them.
When the postwar suburbs were first built
out on the cheap land
away from downtown,
it made sense to just build
surface parking lots.
But those sites have now been leapfrogged
and leapfrogged again,
as we've just continued to sprawl,
and they now have
a relatively central location.
It no longer just makes sense.
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots.
It now makes sense to go back in,
build a deck and build up
on those sites.
So what do you do
with a dead mall,
dead office park?
It turns out, all sorts of things.
In a slow economy like ours,
re-inhabitation is
one of the more popular strategies.
a dead mall in St. Louis
that's been re-inhabited as art-space.
It's now home to artist studios,
theater groups, dance troupes.
It's not pulling in as much tax revenue
as it once was,
but it's serving its community.
It's keeping the lights on.
It's becoming, I think, a really great institution.
Other malls have been re-inhabited
as nursing homes,
as universities,
and as all variety of office space.
We also found a lot of examples
of dead big-box stores
that have been converted into
all sorts of community-serving uses as well --
lots of schools, lots of churches
and lots of libraries like this one.
that is now a public library.
In addition to, I think, doing a beautiful adaptive reuse,
they tore up some of the parking spaces,
put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff,
put in a lot more sidewalks
to connect to the neighborhoods.
And they've made this,
what was just a store along a commercial strip,
into a community gathering space.
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center
in Phoenix, Arizona.
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint,
a gourmet grocery,
and they put up a restaurant in the old post office.
Never underestimate the power of food
to turn a place around
and make it a destination.
It's been so successful, they've now taken over the strip across the street.
The real estate ads in the neighborhood
all very proudly proclaim,
"Walking distance to Le Grande Orange,"
because it provided its neighborhood
with what sociologists like to call
"a third place."
If home is the first place
and work is the second place,
the third place is where you go to hang out
and build community.
And especially as suburbia is becoming
less centered on the family,
the family households,
there's a real hunger
for more third places.
are really those in the next category,
the next strategy: redevelopment.
Now, during the boom, there were several
really dramatic redevelopment projects
where the original building
was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt
at significantly greater density,
a sort of compact, walkable urban neighborhoods.
But some of them have been much more incremental.
This is Mashpee Commons,
the oldest retrofit that we've found.
And it's just incrementally, over the last 20 years,
built urbanism
on top of its parking lots.
So the black and white photo shows
the simple 60's strip shopping center.
And then the maps above that
show its gradual transformation
into a compact,
mixed-use New England village,
and it has plans now that have been approved
for it to connect
to new residential neighborhoods
across the arterials
and over to the other side.
So, you know, sometimes it's incremental.
Sometimes, it's all at once.
this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs
and opened a station nearby to this site,
the owners decided
to build a new parking deck
and then insert on top of their surface lots
a new Main Street, several apartments
and condo buildings,
while keeping the existing office buildings.
Here is the site in 1940:
It was just a little farm
in the village of Hyattsville.
By 1980, it had been subdivided
into a big mall on one side
and the office park on the other
and then some buffer sites for a library
and a church to the far right.
Today, the transit,
the Main Street and the new housing
have all been built.
Eventually, I expect that the streets
will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall.
Plans have already been announced
for a lot of those garden apartments
above the mall to be redeveloped.
Transit is a big driver of retrofits.
So here's what it looks like.
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings
in between the office buildings
and the public space and the new Main Street.
I think they really built an attractive place here
and have just employed all-green construction.
There's massive P.V. arrays on the roofs
as well as wind turbines.
This was a very large mall
on a hundred-acre superblock.
It's now 22
walkable urban blocks
with public streets,
two public parks, eight bus lines
and a range of housing types,
and so it's really given Lakewood, Colorado
the downtown
that this particular suburb never had.
Here was the mall in its heyday.
They had their prom in the mall. They loved their mall.
So here's the site in 1975
with the mall.
By 1995, the mall has died.
The department store has been kept --
and we found this was true in many cases.
The department stores are multistory; they're better built.
They're easy to be re-adapted.
But the one story stuff ...
that's really history.
This project, I think, has great connectivity
to the existing neighborhoods.
It's providing 1,500 households with the option
of a more urban lifestyle.
It's about two-thirds built out right now.
Here's what the new Main Street looks like.
It's very successful,
and it's helped to prompt --
eight of the 13
regional malls in Denver
have now, or have announced plans to
be, retrofitted.
But it's important to note that all of this retrofitting
is not occurring --
just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city.
No, it's pockets of walkability
on the sites of
under-performing properties.
And so it's giving people more choices,
but it's not taking away choices.
to just create pockets of walkability.
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation.
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves.
So this is one that has been
retrofitted in California.
They took the commercial strip
shown on the black-and-white images below,
and they built a boulevard
that has become the Main Street for their town.
And it's transformed from being
an ugly, unsafe,
undesirable address,
to becoming a beautiful,
attractive, dignified sort of good address.
I mean now we're hoping we start to see it;
they've already built City Hall, attracted two hotels.
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there
without tearing down another tree.
So there's a lot of great things,
but I'd love to see more corridors getting retrofitting.
is not going to work everywhere.
Sometimes re-greening
is really the better answer.
There's a lot to learn from successful
landbanking programs
in cities like Flint, Michigan.
There's also a burgeoning suburban farming movement --
sort of victory gardens meets the Internet.
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects
is the opportunity to restore
the local ecology,
as in this example outside of Minneapolis.
When the shopping center died,
the city restored the site's
original wetlands,
creating lakefront property,
which then attracted private investment,
the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood
in over 40 years.
So they've managed to both restore the local ecology
and the local economy at the same time.
This is another re-greening example.
It also makes sense in very strong markets.
This one in Seattle
is on the site of a mall parking lot
adjacent to a new transit stop.
And the wavy line
is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit.
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot.
But daylighting our creeks
really improves their water quality
and contributions to habitat.
the first generation of retrofits.
What's next?
I think we have three challenges for the future.
The first is to plan retrofitting
much more systemically
at the metropolitan scale.
We need to be able to target
which areas really should be re-greened.
Where should we be redeveloping?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation?
These slides just show two images
from a larger project
that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta.
I led a team that was asked to imagine
Atlanta 100 years from now.
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl
through three simple moves -- expensive, but simple.
One, in a hundred years,
transit on all major
rail and road corridors.
Two, in a hundred years,
thousand foot buffers
on all stream corridors.
It's a little extreme, but we've got a little water problem.
In a hundred years,
subdivisions that simply end up too close to water
or too far from transit won't be viable.
And so we've created the eco-acre
transfer-to-transfer development rights
to the transit corridors
and allow the re-greening
of those former subdivisions
for food and energy production.
is to improve the architectural design quality
of the retrofits.
And I close with this image
of democracy in action:
This is a protest that's happening
on a retrofit in Silver Spring, Maryland
on an Astroturf town green.
Now, retrofits are often accused
of being examples of faux downtowns
and instant urbanism,
and not without reason; you don't get much more phony
than an Astroturf town green.
I have to say, these are very hybrid places.
They are new but trying to look old.
They have urban streetscapes,
but suburban parking ratios.
Their populations are
more diverse than typical suburbia,
but they're less diverse than cities.
And they are
public places,
but that are managed by private companies.
And just the surface appearance
are often -- like the Astroturf here --
they make me wince.
So, you know, I mean I'm glad that
the urbanism is doing its job.
The fact that a protest is happening
really does mean
that the layout of the blocks, the streets and blocks, the putting in of public space,
compromised as it may be,
is still a really great thing.
But we've got to get the architecture better.
I want you to join the protest
and start demanding
more sustainable suburban places --
more sustainable places, period.
But culturally,
we tend to think that downtowns
should be dynamic, and we expect that.
But we seem to have an expectation
that the suburbs should forever remain frozen
in whatever adolescent form
they were first given birth to.
It's time to let them grow up,
so I want you
to all support the zoning changes,
the road diets, the infrastructure improvements
and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you.
The story starts in Kenya
in December of 2007,
when there was a disputed presidential election,
and in the immediate aftermath of that election,
there was an outbreak of ethnic violence.
And there was a lawyer in Nairobi, Ory Okolloh --
who some of you may know from her TEDTalk --
who began blogging about it on her site,
Kenyan Pundit.
And shortly after the election and the outbreak of violence,
the government suddenly imposed
a significant media blackout.
And so weblogs went from being
commentary as part of the media landscape
to being a critical part of the media landscape
in trying to understand where the violence was.
And Okolloh solicited
from her commenters
more information about what was going on.
The comments began pouring in,
and Okolloh would collate them. She would post them.
And she quickly said, "It's too much.
I could do this all day every day
and I can't keep up.
There is more information
about what's going on in Kenya right now
than any one person can manage.
If only there was a way to automate this."
held their hands up and said, "We could do that,"
and in 72 hours, they launched Ushahidi.
Ushahidi -- the name means "witness"
or "testimony" in Swahili --
is a very simple way of taking reports from the field,
whether it's from the web or, critically,
via mobile phones and SMS,
aggregating it and putting it on a map.
That's all it is, but that's all that's needed
because what it does is it takes the tacit information
available to the whole population --
everybody knows where the violence is,
but no one person knows what everyone knows --
and it takes that tacit information
and it aggregates it,
and it maps it and it makes it public.
And that, that maneuver
called "crisis mapping,"
was kicked off in Kenya
in January of 2008.
that the programmers who created Ushahidi
decided they were going to make it open source
and turn it into a platform.
It's since been deployed in Mexico
to track electoral fraud.
It's been deployed in Washington D.C. to track snow cleanup.
And it's been used most famously in Haiti
in the aftermath of the earthquake.
And when you look at the map
now posted on the Ushahidi front page,
you can see that the number of deployments in Ushahidi
has gone worldwide, all right?
This went from a single idea
and a single implementation
in East Africa in the beginning of 2008
to a global deployment
in less than three years.
would not have been possible
without digital technology.
What Okolloh did would not have been possible
without human generosity.
And the interesting moment now,
the number of environments
where the social design challenge
relies on both of those things being true.
That is the resource that I'm talking about.
I call it cognitive surplus.
And it represents the ability
of the world's population
to volunteer and to contribute and collaborate
on large, sometimes global, projects.
Cognitive surplus is made up of two things.
The first, obviously, is the world's free time and talents.
The world has over
a trillion hours a year
of free time
to commit to shared projects.
Now, that free time existed in the 20th century,
but we didn't get Ushahidi in the 20th century.
The media landscape in the 20th century
was very good at helping people consume,
and we got, as a result,
very good at consuming.
But now that we've been given media tools --
the Internet, mobile phones -- that let us do more than consume,
what we're seeing is that people weren't couch potatoes
because we liked to be.
We were couch potatoes because that was
the only opportunity given to us.
We still like to consume, of course.
But it turns out we also like to create,
and we like to share.
And it's those two things together --
ancient human motivation
and the modern tools to allow that motivation
to be joined up in large-scale efforts --
that are the new design resource.
And using cognitive surplus,
we're starting to see truly incredible experiments
in scientific, literary,
artistic, political efforts.
Designing.
LOLcats are cute pictures of cats
made cuter with the addition of cute captions.
And they are also
part of the abundant media landscape we're getting now.
This is one of the participatory --
one of the participatory models
we see coming out of that, along with Ushahidi.
Now I want to stipulate, as the lawyers say,
that LOLcats are the stupidest possible
creative act.
There are other candidates of course,
but LOLcats will do as a general case.
But here's the thing:
The stupidest possible creative act
is still a creative act.
Someone who has done something like this,
however mediocre and throwaway,
has tried something, has put something forward in public.
And once they've done it, they can do it again,
and they could work on getting it better.
and as anybody who's worked as an artist or a creator knows,
it's a spectrum you're constantly
struggling to get on top of.
The gap is between
doing anything and doing nothing.
And someone who makes a LOLcat
has already crossed over that gap.
Now it's tempting to want to get the Ushahidis
without the LOLcats, right,
to get the serious stuff without the throwaway stuff.
But media abundance never works that way.
Freedom to experiment means freedom to experiment with anything.
Even with the sacred printing press,
we got erotic novels 150 years
before we got scientific journals.
what is, I think, the critical difference
between LOLcats and Ushahidi,
I want to talk about
their shared source.
And that source is design for generosity.
It is one of the curiosities of our historical era
that even as cognitive surplus
is becoming a resource we can design around,
social sciences are also starting to explain
how important
our intrinsic motivations are to us,
how much we do things because we like to do them
rather than because our boss told us to do them,
or because we're being paid to do them.
by Uri Gneezy and Aldo Rustichini,
who set out to test, at the beginning of this decade,
what they called "deterrence theory."
And deterrence theory is a very simple theory of human behavior:
If you want somebody to do less of something,
add a punishment and they'll do less of it.
Simple, straightforward, commonsensical --
also, largely untested.
And so they went and studied
10 daycare centers in Haifa, Israel.
They studied those daycare centers
at the time of highest tension,
which is pick-up time.
At pick-up time the teachers,
who have been with your children all day,
would like you to be there at the appointed hour to take your children back.
Meanwhile, the parents -- perhaps a little busy at work, running late, running errands --
want a little slack to pick the kids up late.
"How many instances of late pick-ups
are there at these 10 daycare centers?"
Now they saw -- and this is what the graph is,
these are the number of weeks and these are the number of late arrivals --
that there were between six and 10
instances of late pick-ups
on average in these 10 daycare centers.
So they divided the daycare centers into two groups.
The white group there
is the control group; they change nothing.
But the group of daycare centers represented by the black line,
they said, "We are changing this bargain
as of right now.
If you pick your kid up more than 10 minutes late,
we're going to add a 10 shekel fine to your bill.
Boom. No ifs, ands or buts."
the behavior in those daycare centers changed.
Late pick-ups went up
every week for the next four weeks
until they topped out at triple the pre-fine average,
and then they fluctuated
at between double and triple the pre-fine average
for the life of the fine.
And you can see immediately what happened, right?
The fine broke the culture
of the daycare center.
By adding a fine,
what they did was communicate to the parents
that their entire debt to the teachers
had been discharged
with the payment of 10 shekels,
and that there was no residue of guilt or social concern
that the parents owed the teachers.
And so the parents, quite sensibly, said,
"10 shekels to pick my kid up late?
What could be bad?"
(Laughter)
that we inherited in the 20th century
was that we are all rational, self-maximizing actors,
and in that explanation --
the daycare center had no contract --
should have been operating without any constraints.
But that's not right.
They were operating with social constraints
rather than contractual ones.
And critically, the social constraints
created a culture that was more generous
than the contractual constraints did.
So Gneezy and Rustichini run this experiment for a dozen weeks --
run the fine for a dozen weeks --
and then they say, "Okay, that's it. All done; fine."
And then a really interesting thing happens:
Nothing changes.
The culture that got broken by the fine
stayed broken when the fine was removed.
Not only are economic motivations
and intrinsic motivations
incompatible,
that incompatibility
can persist over long periods.
So the trick
in designing these kinds of situations
is to understand where you're relying on
the economic part of the bargain -- as with the parents paying the teachers --
and when you're relying on the social part of the bargain,
when you're really designing for generosity.
and to Ushahidi.
This is, I think, the range that matters.
Both of these rely on cognitive surplus.
Both of these design for the assumption
that people like to create and we want to share.
Here is the critical difference between these:
LOLcats is communal value.
It's value created by the participants
for each other.
Communal value on the networks we have
is everywhere --
every time you see a large aggregate
of shared, publicly available data,
whether it's photos on Flickr
or videos on Youtube or whatever.
This is good. I like LOLcats as much as the next guy,
maybe a little more even,
but this is also
a largely solved problem.
I have a hard time envisioning a future
in which someone is saying,
"Where, oh where, can I find a picture
of a cute cat?"
is civic value.
It's value created by the participants
but enjoyed by society as a whole.
The goals set out by Ushahidi
are not just to make life better
for the participants,
but to make life better for everyone in the society
in which Ushahidi is operating.
And that kind of civic value
is not just a side effect
of opening up to human motivation.
It really is going to be a side effect
of what we, collectively,
make of these kinds of efforts.
There are a trillion
hours a year
of participatory value
up for grabs.
That will be true year-in and year-out.
The number of people who are going to be able
to participate in these kinds of projects
is going to grow,
and we can see that organizations
designed around a culture of generosity
can achieve incredible effects
without an enormous amount of contractual overhead --
a very different model
than our default model for large-scale group action in the 20th century.
is what Dean Kamen said,
the inventor and entrepreneur.
Kamen said, "Free cultures get what they celebrate."
We've got a choice before us.
We've got this trillion hours a year.
We can use it to crack each other up, and we're going to do that.
That, we get for free.
But we can also celebrate
and support and reward the people
trying to use cognitive surplus
to create civic value.
And to the degree we're going to do that, to the degree we're able to do that,
we'll be able to change society.
I'm going to begin by reciting a poem.
"Oh beloved dentist:
Your rubber fingers in my mouth ...
your voice so soft and muffled ...
Lower the mask, dear dentist,
lower the mask."
I'm going to be putting the right side of your brains
through a fairly serious workout.
You're going to see a lot of imagery,
and it's not always connected to what I'm talking about,
so I need you to kind of split your brains in half
and let the images flow over one side
and listen to me on the other.
So I am one of those people
with a transformative personal story.
Six years ago,
after 20 years in graphic design and typography,
I changed the way I was working
and the way most graphic designers work
to pursue a more personal approach to my work,
with only the humble attempt
to simply make a living doing something that I loved.
But something weird happened.
I became bizarrely
popular.
My current work
seems to resonate with people
in a way that has so taken me by surprise
that I still frequently wonder
what in the hell is going on.
And I'm slowly coming to understand
that the appeal of what I do
may be connected to why I do it.
So where my work as a graphic designer
was to follow strategy,
my work now
follows my heart
and my interests
with the guidance of my ego
to create work that is mutually beneficial to myself and a client.
Now, this is heresy
in the design world.
The ego is not supposed
to be involved in graphic design.
But I find that for myself,
without exception,
the more I deal with the work
as something of my own,
as something that is personal,
the more successful it is
as something that's compelling,
interesting and sustaining.
So I exist somewhat outside of the mainstream
of design thinking.
Where others might look at measurable results,
I tend to be interested in more ethereal qualities,
like "Does it bring joy?"
"Is there a sense of wonder?"
and "Does it invoke curiosity?"
I don't have time to explain it,
but it has to do with DNA and RNA.
So I have a particular imaginative approach to visual work.
The things that interest me when I'm working
are visual structure,
surprise
and anything that requires figuring things out.
So for this reason, I'm particularly drawn
to systems and patterns.
I'm going to give you a couple of examples of how my brain works.
The Guardian newspaper in the U.K.
They have a magazine that they call G2.
And this is for their puzzle special
in 2007.
And puzzling it is.
I started by creating a series of tiling units.
And these tiling units, I designed
specifically so that they would contain
parts of letterforms within their shapes
so that I could then
join those pieces together
to create letters and then words
within the abstract patterning.
But then as well, I was able to
just flip them, rotate them
and combine them in different ways
to create either regular patterns
or abstract patterns.
So here's the word puzzle again.
And here it is with the abstract surrounding.
And as you can see, it's extremely difficult to read.
But all I have to do is
fill certain areas of those letterforms
and I can bring those words out of
the background pattern.
But maybe that's a little too obvious.
So then I can add some color in with the background
and add a bit more color in with the words themselves,
and this way, working with the art director,
I'm able to bring it to just the right point
that it's puzzling for the audience --
they can figure out that there's something they have to read --
but it's not impossible for them to read.
unusual materials
and common materials in unusual ways.
So this requires figuring out how to
get the most out of something's innate properties
and also how to bend it to my will.
So ultimately,
my goal is to create something unexpected.
To this end, I have worked in sugar
for Stefan Sagmeister,
three-time TED speaker.
And this project began essentially
on my kitchen table.
I've been eating cereal for breakfast
all of my life.
And for that same amount of time,
I've been spilling sugar on the table
and just kind of playing with it with my fingers.
And eventually I used this technique
to create a piece of artwork.
And then I used it again to create
six pieces for Stefan's book,
"Things in My Life I've Learned So Far."
And these were created
without sketches, just freehand,
by putting the sugar down on a white surface
and then manipulating it to get
the words and designs out of it.
Recently, I've also made some
rather highbrow baroque borders
out of lowbrow pasta.
And this is for a chapter that I'm doing in a book,
and the chapter is on honor.
So it's a little bit unexpected,
but, in a way, it refers
to the macaroni art
that children make for their parents
or they make in school and give to their parents,
which is in itself a form of honor.
This is what you can do with some household tinfoil.
Okay, well, it's what I can do with some household tinfoil.
in design as an impetus to inquiring.
To say I wonder is to say
I question, I ask.
And to experience wonder is to experience awe.
So I'm currently working on a book,
which plays with both senses of the word,
as I explore some of my own ideas
and inquiries
in a visual display of rather
peacock-like grandeur.
The world is full of wonder.
But the world of graphic design,
for the most part, is not.
So I'm using my own writings
as a kind of testing ground for a book that has
an interdependency between word and image
as a kind of seductive force.
I think that one of the things
that religions got right
was the use of visual wonder
to deliver a message.
I think this true marriage of art and information
is woefully underused in adult literature,
and I'm mystified as to
why visual wealth is not more commonly used
to enhance intellectual wealth.
When we look at works like this,
we tend to associate them with children's literature.
There's an implication that ornamental graphics
detract from the seriousness of the content.
But I really hope to have the opportunity
to change that perception.
This book is taking rather a long time,
but I'm nearly done.
to put an intermission
in my talk.
And this is it -- just to give you and me a moment to catch up.
I've been sending out valentines
on a fairly large scale since 2005.
These are my valentines
from 2005 and 2006.
And I started by
doing just a single image like this
and sending them out to each person.
But in 2007,
I got the cockamamie idea
to hand-draw each valentine
for everyone on my mailing list.
I reduced my mailing list to 150 people.
And I drew each person
their own unique valentine
and put their name on it
and numbered it and signed it and sent it out.
Believe it or not, I devised this
as a timesaving method.
I was very busy in the beginning of that year,
and I didn't know when I was going to find time
to design and print a single valentine.
And I thought that I could kind of do this piecemeal
as I was traveling.
It didn't exactly work out that way.
There's a longer story to this,
but I did get them all done in time,
and they were extremely well received.
I got an almost 100 percent response rate.
(Laughter)
And those who didn't respond
will never receive anything from me ever again.
I took a more conceptual approach to the valentine.
I had this idea that I wanted people
to receive a kind of
mysterious love letter,
like a found fragment in their mailbox.
I wanted it to be something
that was not addressed to them
or signed by me,
something that caused them to wonder
what on Earth this thing was.
And I specifically wrote
four pages that don't connect.
There were four different versions of this.
And I wrote them
so that they begin in the middle of a sentence,
end in the middle of a sentence.
And they're on the one hand, universal,
so I avoid specific names or places,
but on the other hand, they're personal.
So I wanted people to really get the sense that
they had received something that could have been
a love letter to them.
And I'm just going to read one of them to you.
but I can assure you that this quirk
you're so self-conscious of
is intensely endearing.
Just please accept that this piece of you
escapes with your smile,
and those of us who notice
are happy to catch it in passing.
Time spent with you is like chasing and catching small birds,
but without the scratches and bird shit."
(Laughter)
"That is to say,
your thoughts and words flit and dart,
disconcertedly elusive at times,
but when caught and examined --
ahh, such a wonder,
such a delightful reward.
There's no passing time with you,
only collecting --
the collecting of moments with the hope for preservation
and at the same time release.
Impossible? I don't think so.
I know this makes you embarrassed.
I'm certain I can see you blushing.
But I just have to tell you because
sometimes I hear your self-doubt,
and it's so crushing to think
that you may not know how truly wonderful you are,
how inspiring and delightful
and really, truly the most completely ..."
is coming up in a couple of days,
and these are currently arriving
in mailboxes all around the world.
This year, I got, what I really have to say
is a rather brilliant idea,
to laser cut
my valentines
out of used Christmas cards.
So I solicited friends
to send me their used Christmas cards,
and I made 500 of these.
Each one of them is completely different.
I'm just really, really thrilled with them.
I don't have that much else to say,
but they turned out really well.
And one of the things that I've been thinking about recently
is what is worth while.
What is it that's worth spending my time on
and my life on in this way?
Working in the commercial world,
this is something that I do have to struggle with at times.
And yes, sometimes I'm swayed by money.
But ultimately, I don't consider that a worthy goal.
What makes something worthwhile for me
is the people I work for or with,
the conditions I work under
and the audience that I'm able to reach.
So I might ask: "Who is it for?"
"What does it say?"
and "What does it do?"
for someone like me to come up on stage
at this conference
with these unbelievably brilliant minds,
who are thinking these
really big-picture,
world-changing, life-changing
ideas and technologies.
And it's very, very common
for designers and people in the visual arts
to feel that we're
not contributing enough,
or worse, that all we're doing is
contributing to landfill.
Here I am; I'm showing you
some pretty visuals
and talking about aesthetics.
But I've come to believe that
truly imaginative visual work
is extremely important in society.
by books
and magazines of all kinds,
conversations I have, movies,
so I also think,
when I put visual work out there into the mass media,
work that is interesting, unusual,
intriguing,
work that maybe opens up that sense
of inquiry in the mind,
that I'm seeding the imagination of the populace.
And you just never know who
is going to take something from that
and turn it into something else,
because inspiration
is cross-pollinating.
So a piece of mine
may inspire a playwright
or a novelist or a scientist,
and that in turn may be the seed
that inspires a doctor
or a philanthropist
or a babysitter.
And this isn't something that you can quantify
or track or measure,
and we tend to undervalue things in society
that we can't measure.
that a fully operating, rich society
needs these seeds coming from all directions
and all disciplines
in order to keep the gears of inspiration
and imagination
flowing and cycling and growing.
So that's why I do what I do,
and why I spend so much time and effort on it,
and why I work in the commercial, public sphere,
as opposed to the isolated, private sphere
of fine art:
because I want as many people as possible
to see my work, notice it, be drawn into it,
and be able to take something from it.
And I actually really feel that it's worthwhile
to spend my valuable
and limited time on this Earth
in this way.
And I thank you for allowing me to show it to you.
So, these are
the Dark Ages.
And the Dark Ages are the time between
when you put away the LEGO
for the last time as a kid,
and you decide as an adult that it is okay to play with a kid's toy.
Started out with my then four-year-old:
"Oh, should buy the kid some LEGO.
That stuff's cool."
Walked into the LEGO store.
Bought him this.
It's totally appropriate for a four-year-old.
(Laughter)
I think the box says --
let's see here --
"8 to 12" on it.
I turn to my wife and said, "Who are we buying this for?"
She's like, "Oh, us." I'm like, "Okay. All right. That's cool."
The dining room looked like this.
You walk there, and it hurts.
So we took a room downstairs in the basement
that had been used as sort of an Abu Ghraib annex.
(Laughter)
Torture, very funny.
Wow, you guys are great.
And we put down those little floor tiles,
and then I went onto eBay
and bought 150 pounds of LEGO --
(Laughter)
which is insane.
My daughter -- the day we got it, I was tucking her in --
and I said,
"Honey, you're my treasure."
And she said, "No, the LEGO is the treasure."
And then she said, "Dad, we're LEGO rich."
I was like, "Yeah.
I suppose we are."
So then once you do that
you're like, "Oh, crap. Where am I going to put all this?"
So you go to The Container Store
and spend an enormous amount of money,
and then you start this crazy sorting process
that never --
it's just nuts.
Whatever.
And you go to one of these conventions, and some dude built the Titanic.
And you're like, "Holy shit!
He had to come in like a truck,
a semi, with this thing."
And then someone built this -- this is the Smith Tower in Seattle.
Just beautiful.
And there's a dude selling these
aftermarket weapons for LEGO,
because LEGO -- the Danish --
no, they're not into guns.
But the Americans? Oh, we'll make some guns for LEGO, no problem.
And at a certain point, you look around,
you're like, "Whoa, this is a really nerdy crowd."
And I mean like this is a nerdy crowd,
but that's like a couple of levels above furries.
(Laughter)
The nerds here, they get laid --
except for the lady with the condoms in her pocket --
and you say to yourself at some point,
"Am I part of this group? Like, am I into this?"
And I was just like, "Yeah, I guess I am.
I'm coming out.
I'm kind of into this stuff, and I'm going to stop being embarrassed."
and you're like, "Well, the LEGO people in Denmark, they've got all this software
to let you build your own virtually."
And so this is like this CAD program where you build it.
And then whatever you design virtually,
you click the button and it shows up at your doorstep a week later.
And then some of the designs that people do
they actually sell in the store.
The LEGO guys don't give you any royalties, strangely,
but some user made this and then it sold.
And it's pretty amazing actually.
LEGO-provided CAD program isn't enough,
there's an entire open-source, third-party,
independent LEGO CAD program
that lets you do 3D modeling
and 3D rendering
and make, in fact, movies out of LEGO,
3D films
of which there are thousands on YouTube,
and some of them sort of mimicking famous films
and some totally original content --
just beautiful --
and people recreating all sorts of things.
I have to take a moment.
I love the guy who's like running away
with his clasps, his hooks.
Okay. Anyway.
so if you want to teach someone how to program,
kid, adult, whatever it is.
And the guy that made this,
he made a slot machine out of LEGO.
And I don't mean he made LEGO that looked like a slot machine;
I mean he made a slot machine out of LEGO.
The insides were LEGO.
and you've got to finish the thing before you puke.
There's a whole gray market for LEGO,
thousands of home-based businesses.
And some people will fund their entire LEGO habit
by selling the little guy,
but then you have no guys in your ships.
This is amazing what you can do.
And don't kid yourself:
some architectural details, incredible organic shapes
and just, even, nature out of, again, little blocks.
This is my house.
And this is my house.
I was afraid a car was going to come smash it
as I was taking a picture for you guys.
But just very quickly --
we'll just see if I can do this quick.
Because there aren't enough TED logos around here.
(Laughter)
Let's see here.
Okay.
Ta-da.
When I was 10 years old,
a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school.
And as a special treat,
he took me to the pathology lab
and took a real human brain
out of the jar
and placed it in my hands.
And there it was,
the seat of human consciousness,
the powerhouse of the human body,
sitting in my hands.
And that day I knew that when I grew up,
I was going to become a brain doctor,
scientist, something or the other.
my dream came true.
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes
of dyslexia in children
that I encountered a startling fact
that I'd like to share with you all today.
It is estimated that one in six children,
that's one in six children,
suffer from some developmental disorder.
This is a disorder that
retards mental development in the child
and causes permanent mental impairments.
Which means that each and every one of you here today
knows at least one child that is suffering
from a developmental disorder.
Despite the fact that each
and every one of these disorders
originates in the brain,
most of these disorders
are diagnosed solely on the basis
of observable behavior.
But diagnosing a brain disorder
without actually looking at the brain
is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem
based on their physical symptoms,
without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray
to look at the heart.
It seemed so intuitive to me.
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately,
it would be necessary to look at the brain directly.
Looking at behavior alone
can miss a vital piece of the puzzle
and provide an incomplete, or even a misleading,
picture of the child's problems.
Yet, despite all the advances in medical technology,
the diagnosis of brain disorders
in one in six children
still remained so limited.
that had taken one such advanced medical technology
and finally applied it,
instead of in brain research,
towards diagnosing brain disorders in children.
Their groundbreaking technology
records the EEG, or the electrical activity
of the brain, in real time,
allowing us to watch the brain
as it performs various functions
and then detect even the slightest abnormality
in any of these functions:
vision, attention, language, audition.
A program called Brain Electrical
Activity Mapping
then triangulates the source
of that abnormality in the brain.
And another program called
Statistical Probability Mapping
then performs mathematical calculations
to determine whether any of these abnormalities
are clinically significant,
allowing us to provide a much more accurate
neurological diagnosis
of the child's symptoms.
And so I became the head of neurophysiology
for the clinical arm of this team,
and we're finally able to use this technology
towards actually helping
children with brain disorders.
And I'm happy to say that I'm now in the process
of setting up this technology here in India.
whose story was also covered by ABC News.
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar
came to our clinic with this diagnosis
of very severe autism.
Like many autistic children,
his mind was locked inside his body.
There were moments when he would
actually space out for seconds at a time.
And the doctors told his parents
he was never going to be able
to communicate or interact socially,
and he would probably never have too much language.
to actually look at Justin's brain,
the results were startling.
It turned out that Justin was almost
certainly not autistic.
He was suffering from brain seizures
that were impossible to see with the naked eye,
but that were actually causing symptoms
that mimicked those of autism.
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication,
the change in him was amazing.
Within a period of 60 days,
his vocabulary went from two to three words
to 300 words.
And his communication and social interaction
were improved so dramatically
that he was enrolled into a regular school
and even became a karate super champ.
almost 50 percent of children
diagnosed with autism
are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures.
These are the faces of the children
that I have tested
with stories just like Justin.
All these children
came to our clinic with a diagnosis
of autism, attention deficit disorder,
mental retardation, language problems.
Instead, our EEG scans revealed
very specific problems hidden within their brains
that couldn't possibly have been detected
by their behavioral assessments.
So these EEG scans
enabled us to provide these children
with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis
and much more targeted treatment.
have suffered from misdiagnosis
while their real problems have gone undetected
and left to worsen.
And for too long, these children and their parents
have suffered undue frustration and desperation.
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience,
one in which we can finally look
directly at brain function in real time
with no risks and no side effects, non-invasively,
and find the true source
of so many disabilities in children.
even a fraction of you in the audience today
to share this pioneering diagnostic approach
with even one parent whose child
is suffering from a developmental disorder,
then perhaps one more puzzle
in one more brain will be solved.
One more mind will be unlocked.
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed
or even undiagnosed by the system
will finally realize his or her true potential
while there's still time
for his or her brain to recover.
And all this by simply watching the child's brainwaves.
It's a great pleasure to be here.
It's a great pleasure to speak after
Brian Cox from CERN.
I think CERN is the home
of the Large Hadron Collider.
What ever happened to the Small Hadron Collider?
Where is the Small Hadron Collider?
Because the Small Hadron Collider once was the big thing.
Now, the Small Hadron Collider
is in a cupboard, overlooked and neglected.
You know when the Large Hadron Collider started,
and it didn't work, and people tried to work out why,
it was the Small Hadron Collider team
who sabotaged it
because they were so jealous.
The whole Hadron Collider family
needs unlocking.
all those fantastic pictures --
is this really:
that vantage point determines everything that you see.
What Brian was saying was
science has opened up successively different vantage points
from which we can see ourselves,
and that's why it's so valuable.
So the vantage point you take
determines virtually everything that you will see.
The question that you will ask
will determine much of the answer that you get.
Where would you look to see the future of education?
The answer that we've traditionally given to that
is very straightforward, at least in the last 20 years:
You go to Finland.
Finland is the best place in the world to see school systems.
The Finns may be a bit boring and depressive and there's a very high suicide rate,
but by golly, they are qualified.
And they have absolutely amazing education systems.
So we all troop off to Finland,
and we wonder at the social democratic miracle of Finland
and its cultural homogeneity and all the rest of it,
and then we struggle to imagine how we might
bring lessons back.
with the help of Cisco who sponsored me,
for some balmy reason, to do this,
I've been looking somewhere else.
Because actually radical innovation does sometimes
come from the very best,
but it often comes from places
where you have huge need --
unmet, latent demand --
and not enough resources for traditional solutions to work --
traditional, high-cost solutions,
which depend on professionals,
which is what schools and hospitals are.
This is a place called Monkey Hill.
It's one of the hundreds of favelas in Rio.
Most of the population growth of the next 50 years
will be in cities.
We'll grow by six cities of 12 million people a year
for the next 30 years.
Almost all of that growth will be in the developed world.
Almost all of that growth will be
in places like Monkey Hill.
This is where you'll find the fastest growing
young populations of the world.
So if you want recipes to work --
for virtually anything -- health, education,
government politics
and education --
you have to go to these places.
And if you go to these places, you meet people like this.
At the age of 14,
in common with many 14-year-olds in the Brazilian education system,
he dropped out of school.
It was boring.
And Juanderson, instead, went into
what provided kind of opportunity and hope
in the place that he lived, which was the drugs trade.
And by the age of 16, with rapid promotion,
he was running the drugs trade in 10 favelas.
He was turning over 200,000 dollars a week.
He employed 200 people.
He was going to be dead by the age of 25.
And luckily, he met this guy,
who is Rodrigo Baggio,
the owner of the first laptop to ever appear in Brazil.
1994, Rodrigo started something
called CDI,
which took computers
donated by corporations,
put them into community centers in favelas
and created places like this.
What turned Juanderson around
was technology for learning
that made learning fun and accessible.
This is Kibera, which is the largest slum in East Africa.
Millions of people living here,
stretched over many kilometers.
And there I met these two,
Azra on the left, Maureen on the right.
They just finished their Kenyan certificate
of secondary education.
That name should tell you that the Kenyan education system
borrows almost everything
from Britain, circa 1950,
but has managed to make it even worse.
So there are schools in slums like this.
They're places like this.
That's where Maureen went to school.
They're private schools. There are no state schools in slums.
And the education they got was pitiful.
It was in places like this. This a school set up by some nuns
in another slum called Nakuru.
Half the children in this classroom have no parents
because they've died through AIDS.
The other half have one parent
because the other parent has died through AIDS.
So the challenges of education
in this kind of place
are not to learn the kings and queens of Kenya or Britain.
They are to stay alive, to earn a living,
to not become HIV positive.
The one technology that spans rich and poor
in places like this
is not anything to do with industrial technology.
It's not to do with electricity or water.
It's the mobile phone.
If you want to design from scratch
virtually any service in Africa,
you would start now with the mobile phone.
Or you could go to places like this.
which is a very developed slum
about 25 minutes outside New Delhi,
where I met these characters
who showed me around for the day.
The remarkable thing about these girls,
and the sign of the kind of social revolution
sweeping through the developing world
is that these girls are not married.
Ten years ago, they certainly would have been married.
Now they're not married, and they want to go on
to study further, to have a career.
They've been brought up by mothers who are illiterate,
who have never ever done homework.
All across the developing world there are millions of parents --
tens, hundreds of millions --
who for the first time
are with children doing homework and exams.
And the reason they carry on studying
is not because they went to a school like this.
This is a private school.
This is a fee-pay school. This is a good school.
This is the best you can get
in Hyderabad in Indian education.
The reason they went on studying was this.
by a revolutionary social entrepreneur
called Sugata Mitra
who has conducted the most radical experiments,
showing that children, in the right conditions,
can learn on their own with the help of computers.
Those girls have never touched Google.
They know nothing about Wikipedia.
Imagine what their lives would be like
if you could get that to them.
through this tour,
and by looking at about a hundred case studies
of different social entrepreneurs
working in these very extreme conditions,
look at the recipes that they come up with for learning,
they look nothing like school.
What do they look like?
Well, education is a global religion.
And education, plus technology,
is a great source of hope.
You can go to places like this.
Most of the children there have parents who are illiterate.
Many of them don't have electricity at home.
But they find it completely obvious
to use computers, websites,
make videos, so on and so forth.
When you go to places like this
what you see is that
education in these settings
works by pull, not push.
Most of our education system is push.
I was literally pushed to school.
When you get to school, things are pushed at you:
knowledge, exams,
systems, timetables.
If you want to attract people like Juanderson
who could, for instance,
buy guns, wear jewelry,
ride motorbikes and get girls
through the drugs trade,
and you want to attract him into education,
having a compulsory curriculum doesn't really make sense.
That isn't really going to attract him.
You need to pull him.
And so education needs to work by pull, not push.
is completely irrelevant in a setting like this.
You need to start education
from things that make a difference
to them in their settings.
What does that?
Well, the key is motivation, and there are two aspects to it.
One is to deliver extrinsic motivation,
that education has a payoff.
Our education systems all work
on the principle that there is a payoff,
but you have to wait quite a long time.
That's too long if you're poor.
Waiting 10 years for the payoff from education
is too long when you need to meet daily needs,
when you've got siblings to look after
or a business to help with.
So you need education to be relevant and help people
to make a living there and then, often.
And you also need to make it intrinsically interesting.
This is an amazing guy, Sebastiao Rocha,
in Belo Horizonte,
in the third largest city in Brazil.
He's invented more than 200 games
to teach virtually any subject under the sun.
In the schools and communities
that Taio works in,
the day always starts in a circle
and always starts from a question.
Imagine an education system that started from questions,
not from knowledge to be imparted,
or started from a game, not from a lesson,
or started from the premise
that you have to engage people first
before you can possibly teach them.
Our education systems,
you do all that stuff afterward, if you're lucky,
sport, drama, music.
These things, they teach through.
They attract people to learning
because it's really a dance project
or a circus project
or, the best example of all --
El Sistema in Venezuela --
it's a music project.
And so you attract people through that into learning,
not adding that on after
all the learning has been done
and you've eaten your cognitive greens.
uses a violin as a technology of learning.
Taio Rocha uses making soap
as a technology of learning.
And what you find when you go to these schemes
is that they use people and places
in incredibly creative ways.
Masses of peer learning.
How do you get learning to people
when there are no teachers,
when teachers won't come, when you can't afford them,
and even if you do get teachers,
what they teach isn't relevant to the communities that they serve?
Well, you create your own teachers.
You create peer-to-peer learning,
or you create para-teachers, or you bring in specialist skills.
But you find ways to get learning that's relevant to people
through technology, people and places that are different.
on a building site
in Pune, the fastest growing city in Asia.
Pune has 5,000 building sites.
It has 30,000 children
on those building sites.
That's one city.
Imagine that urban explosion
that's going to take place across the developing world
and how many thousands of children
will spend their school years on building sites.
Well, this is a very simple scheme
to get the learning to them through a bus.
And they all treat learning,
not as some sort of academic, analytical activity,
but as that's something that's productive,
something you make,
something that you can do, perhaps earn a living from.
He'd spent three years in Nairobi living on the streets
because his parents had died of AIDS.
And he was finally brought back into school,
not by the offer of GCSEs,
but by the offer of learning how to become a carpenter,
a practical making skill.
So the trendiest schools in the world,
High Tech High and others,
they espouse a philosophy of learning as productive activity.
Here, there isn't really an option.
Learning has to be productive
in order for it to make sense.
and it's a Chinese restaurant model
of how to scale.
And I learned it from this guy,
who is an amazing character.
He's probably the most remarkable social entrepreneur
in education in the world.
His name is Madhav Chavan,
and he created something called Pratham.
And Pratham runs preschool play groups
for, now, 21 million children in India.
It's the largest NGO in education in the world.
And it also supports working-class kids going into Indian schools.
He's a complete revolutionary.
He's actually a trade union organizer by background,
and that's how he learned the skills
to build his organization.
Pratham got big enough to attract
some pro bono support from McKinsey.
McKinsey came along and looked at his model and said,
"You know what you should do with this, Madhav?
You should turn it into McDonald's.
And what you do when you go to any new site
is you kind of roll out a franchise.
And it's the same wherever you go.
It's reliable and people know exactly where they are.
And there will be no mistakes."
And Madhav said,
"Why do we have to do it that way?
Why can't we do it more like the Chinese restaurants?"
but there is no Chinese restaurant chain.
Yet, everyone knows what is a Chinese restaurant.
They know what to expect, even though it'll be subtly different
and the colors will be different and the name will be different.
You know a Chinese restaurant when you see it.
These people work with the Chinese restaurant model --
same principles, different applications and different settings --
not the McDonald's model.
The McDonald's model scales.
The Chinese restaurant model spreads.
started with social entrepreneurship
in the 19th century.
And that's desperately what we need again
on a global scale.
And what can we learn from all of that?
Well, we can learn a lot
because our education systems
are failing desperately in many ways.
They fail to reach the people
they most need to serve.
They often hit their target but miss the point.
Improvement is increasingly
difficult to organize;
our faith in these systems, incredibly fraught.
And this is just a very simple way of
understanding what kind of innovation,
what kind of different design we need.
There's sustaining innovation,
which will sustain an existing institution or an organization,
and disruptive innovation
that will break it apart, create some different way of doing it.
There are formal settings --
schools, colleges, hospitals --
in which innovation can take place,
and informal settings -- communities,
families, social networks.
Almost all our effort goes in this box,
sustaining innovation in formal settings,
getting a better version
of the essentially Bismarckian school system
that developed in the 19th century.
And as I said, the trouble with this is that,
in the developing world
there just aren't teachers to make this model work.
You'd need millions and millions of teachers
in China, India, Nigeria
and the rest of developing world to meet need.
And in our system, we know
that simply doing more of this won't eat into
deep educational inequalities,
especially in inner cities
and former industrial areas.
We need more reinvention.
And all around the world now you see
more and more schools reinventing themselves.
They're recognizably schools, but they look different.
There are Big Picture schools
in the U.S. and Australia.
There are Kunskapsskolan schools
in Sweden.
Of 14 of them,
only two of them are in schools.
Most of them are in other buildings not designed as schools.
There is an amazing school in Northen Queensland
called Jaringan.
And they all have the same kind of features:
highly collaborative, very personalized,
often pervasive technology,
learning that starts from questions
and problems and projects,
not from knowledge and curriculum.
So we certainly need more of that.
aren't just in school,
they're in family and community,
what you also need, definitely,
is more on the right hand side.
You need efforts to supplement schools.
The most famous of these is Reggio Emilia in Italy,
the family-based learning system
to support and encourage people in schools.
The most exciting is the Harlem Children's Zone,
which over 10 years, led by Geoffrey Canada,
has, through a mixture of schooling
and family and community projects,
attempted to transform not just education in schools,
but the entire culture and aspiration
of about 10,000 families in Harlem.
We need more of that
completely new and radical thinking.
You can go to places an hour away, less,
from this room,
just down the road, which need that,
which need radicalism of a kind that we haven't imagined.
that could imagine getting learning to people
in completely new and different ways.
So we are on the verge, 2015,
of an amazing achievement,
the schoolification of the world.
Every child up to the age of 15 who wants a place in school
will be able to have one in 2015.
It's an amazing thing.
But it is,
unlike cars, which have developed
so rapidly and orderly,
actually the school system is recognizably
an inheritance from the 19th century,
from a Bismarkian model of German schooling
that got taken up by English reformers,
and often by
religious missionaries,
taken up in the United States
as a force of social cohesion,
and then in Japan and South Korea as they developed.
And of course it's a huge achievement.
And of course it will bring great things.
It will bring skills and learning and reading.
But it will also lay waste to imagination.
It will lay waste to appetite. It will lay waste to social confidence.
It will stratify society
as much as it liberates it.
And we are bequeathing to the developing world
school systems that they will now spend
a century trying to reform.
That is why we need really radical thinking,
and why radical thinking is now
more possible and more needed than ever in how we learn.
I'm going to talk about the simple truth in leadership
in the 21st century.
In the 21st century, we need to actually look at --
and what I'm actually going to encourage you to consider today --
is to go back to our school days
when we learned how to count.
But I think it's time for us to think about what we count.
Because what we actually count
truly counts.
This is Van Quach.
She came to this country in 1986 from Vietnam.
She changed her name to Vivian
because she wanted to fit in here in America.
Her first job was at an inner-city motel
in San Francisco as a maid.
I happened to buy that motel
about three months after Vivian started working there.
So Vivian and I have been working together for 23 years.
in 1987,
I started my company and I called it Joie de Vivre,
a very impractical name,
because I actually was looking to create joy of life.
And this first hotel that I bought, motel,
was a pay-by-the-hour, no-tell motel
in the inner-city of San Francisco.
As I spent time with Vivian,
I saw that she had sort of a joie de vivre
in how she did her work.
It made me question and curious:
How could someone actually find joy
in cleaning toilets for a living?
So I spent time with Vivian, and I saw that
she didn't find joy in cleaning toilets.
Her job, her goal and her calling
was not to become the world's greatest toilet scrubber.
What counts for Vivian was the emotional connection
she created with her fellow employees and our guests.
And what gave her inspiration and meaning
was the fact that she was taking care of people
who were far away from home.
Because Vivian knew what it was like to be far away from home.
more than 20 years ago,
served me well during the last
economic downturn we had.
In the wake of the dotcom crash and 9/11,
San Francisco Bay Area hotels
went through the largest percentage revenue drop
in the history of American hotels.
We were the largest operator of hotels in the Bay Area,
so we were particularly vulnerable.
But also back then,
remember we stopped eating French fries in this country.
Well, not exactly, of course not.
We started eating "freedom fries,"
and we started boycotting anything that was French.
Well, my name of my company, Joie de Vivre --
so I started getting these letters
from places like Alabama and Orange County
saying to me that they were going to boycott my company
because they thought we were a French company.
And I'd write them back, and I'd say, "What a minute. We're not French.
We're an American company. We're based in San Francisco."
And I'd get a terse response: "Oh, that's worse."
when I was feeling a little depressed and not a lot of joie de vivre,
I ended up in the local bookstore around the corner from our offices.
And I initially ended up in the business section of the bookstore
looking for a business solution.
But given my befuddled state of mind, I ended up
in the self-help section very quickly.
That's where I got reacquainted with
Abraham Maslow's "hierarchy of needs."
I took one psychology class in college,
and I learned about this guy, Abraham Maslow,
as many of us are familiar with his hierarchy of needs.
But as I sat there for four hours,
the full afternoon, reading Maslow,
I recognized something
that is true of most leaders.
One of the simplest facts in business
is something that we often neglect,
and that is that we're all human.
Each of us, no matter what our role is in business,
has some hierarchy of needs
in the workplace.
what I started to realize is that
Maslow, later in his life,
wanted to take this hierarchy for the individual
and apply it to the collective,
to organizations and specifically to business.
But unfortunately, he died prematurely in 1970,
and so he wasn't really able to live that dream completely.
So I realized in that dotcom crash
that my role in life was to channel Abe Maslow.
And that's what I did a few years ago
when I took that five-level hierarchy of needs pyramid
and turned it into what I call the transformation pyramid,
which is survival, success and transformation.
It's not just fundamental in business, it's fundamental in life.
And we started asking ourselves the questions
about how we were actually addressing
the higher needs, these transformational needs
for our key employees in the company.
These three levels of the hierarchy needs
relate to the five levels
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.
the higher needs of our employees and our customers,
I realized we had no metrics.
We had nothing that actually could tell us whether we were actually getting it right.
So we started asking ourselves:
What kind of less obvious metrics
could we use to actually evaluate
our employees' sense of meaning,
or our customers' sense of emotional connection with us?
For example, we actually started asking our employees,
do they understand the mission of our company,
and do they feel like they believe in it,
can they actually influence it,
and do they feel that their work actually has an impact on it?
We started asking our customers,
did they feel an emotional connection with us,
in one of seven different kinds of ways.
Miraculously, as we asked these questions
and started giving attention higher up the pyramid,
what we found is we created more loyalty.
Our customer loyalty skyrocketed.
Our employee turnover dropped
to one-third of the industry average,
and during that five year dotcom bust,
we tripled in size.
and asking them how they were getting through that time,
what they told me over and over again
was that they just manage what they can measure.
What we can measure is that tangible stuff
at the bottom of the pyramid.
They didn't even see the intangible stuff
higher up the pyramid.
So I started asking myself the question:
How can we get leaders to start valuing the intangible?
If we're taught as leaders to just manage what we can measure,
and all we can measure is the tangible in life,
we're missing a whole lot of things at the top of the pyramid.
and I found a survey that showed
that 94 percent
of business leaders worldwide
believe that the intangibles are important in their business,
things like intellectual property,
their corporate culture, their brand loyalty,
and yet, only five percent of those same leaders
actually had a means of measuring the intangibles in their business.
So as leaders, we understand
that intangibles are important,
but we don't have a clue how to measure them.
So here's another Einstein quote:
"Not everything that can be counted counts,
and not everything that counts can be counted."
I hate to argue with Einstein,
but if that which is most valuable
in our life and our business
actually can't be counted or valued,
aren't we going to spend our lives
just mired in measuring the mundane?
that led me to take my CEO hat off for a week
and fly off to the Himalayan peaks.
I flew off to a place that's been shrouded in mystery for centuries,
a place some folks call Shangri-La.
It's actually moved from the survival base of the pyramid
to becoming a transformational
role model for the world.
I went to Bhutan.
The teenage king of Bhutan was also a curious man,
but this was back in 1972,
when he ascended to the throne
two days after his father passed away.
At age 17, he started asking the kinds of questions
that you'd expect of someone with a beginner's mind.
early in his reign as king,
he was asked by an Indian journalist
about the Bhutanese GDP,
the size of the Bhutanese GDP.
The king responded in a fashion
that actually has transformed us four decades later.
He said the following, he said: "Why are we so obsessed
and focused with gross domestic product?
Why don't we care more about
gross national happiness?"
Now, in essence, the king was asking us to consider
an alternative definition of success,
what has come to be known as
GNH, or gross national happiness.
Most world leaders didn't take notice,
and those that did thought this was just "Buddhist economics."
But the king was serious.
This was a notable moment,
because this was the first time a world leader
in almost 200 years
had suggested
that intangible of happiness --
that leader 200 years ago,
Thomas Jefferson with the Declaration of Independence --
200 years later,
this king was suggesting that intangible of happiness
is something that we should measure,
and it's something we should actually value
as government officials.
this king actually started measuring
and managing around happiness in Bhutan --
including, just recently, taking his country
from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy
with no bloodshed, no coup.
Bhutan, for those of you who don't know it,
is the newest democracy in the world, just two years ago.
I got to really understand what they're doing.
And I got to spend some time with the prime minister.
Over dinner, I asked him an impertinent question.
I asked him,
"How can you create and measure
something which evaporates --
in other words, happiness?"
And he's a very wise man, and he said,
"Listen, Bhutan's goal is not to create happiness.
We create the conditions for happiness to occur.
In other words, we create a habitat of happiness."
Wow, that's interesting.
He said that they have a science behind that art,
and they've actually created four essential pillars,
nine key indicators
and 72 different metrics
that help them to measure their GNH.
One of those key indicators is:
How do the Bhutanese feel about
how they spend their time each day?
It's a good question. How do you feel about
how you spend your time each day?
Time is one of the scarcest resources
in the modern world.
And yet, of course,
that little intangible piece of data
doesn't factor into our GDP calculations.
I started to imagine
what I call an emotional equation.
And it focuses on something I read long ago
from a guy named Rabbi Hyman Schachtel.
How many know him? Anybody?
1954, he wrote a book called "The Real Enjoyment of Living,"
and he suggested that happiness
is not about having what you want;
instead, it's about wanting what you have.
Or in other words, I think the Bhutanese believe
happiness equals wanting what you have --
imagine gratitude --
divided by having what you want --
gratification.
The Bhutanese aren't on some aspirational treadmill,
constantly focused on what they don't have.
Their religion, their isolation,
their deep respect for their culture
and now the principles of their GNH movement
all have fostered a sense of gratitude
about what they do have.
How many of us here, as TEDsters in the audience,
spend more of our time
in the bottom half of this equation, in the denominator?
We are a bottom-heavy culture
in more ways than one.
quite often we do focus on the pursuit of happiness
as if happiness is something that we have to go out --
an object that we're supposed to get, or maybe many objects.
Actually, in fact, if you look in the dictionary,
many dictionaries define pursuit
as to "chase with hostility."
Do we pursue happiness with hostility?
Good question. But back to Bhutan.
by 38 percent of the world's population.
Could this little country,
like a startup in a mature industry,
be the spark plug that influences
a 21st century
of middle-class in China and India?
Bhutan's created the ultimate export,
a new global currency of well-being,
and there are 40 countries around the world today
that are studying their own GNH.
You may have heard, this last fall
Nicolas Sarkozy in France
announcing the results of an 18-month study
by two Nobel economists,
focusing on happiness and wellness in France.
Sarkozy suggested that
world leaders should stop
myopically focusing on GDP
and consider a new index,
what some French are calling a "joie de vivre index."
I like it.
Co-branding opportunities.
we had a simulcast of David Cameron,
potentially the next prime minister of the UK,
quoting one of my favorite speeches of all-time,
Robert Kennedy's poetic speech from 1968
when he suggested that we're
myopically focused on the wrong thing
and that GDP is a misplaced metric.
So it suggests that the momentum is shifting.
and I've turned it into a new balance sheet for just a moment here.
This is a collection of things
that Robert Kennedy said in that quote.
GDP counts everything from air pollution
to the destruction of our redwoods.
But it doesn't count the health of our children
or the integrity of our public officials.
As you look at these two columns here,
doesn't it make you feel like it's time for us
to start figuring out a new way to count,
a new way to imagine
what's important to us in life?
He said GDP "measures everything in short,
except that which makes life worthwhile."
Wow.
So how do we do that?
Let me say one thing we can just start doing
ten years from now, at least in this country.
Why in the heck in America
are we doing a census in 2010?
We're spending 10 billion dollars on the census.
We're asking 10 simple questions -- it is simplicity.
But all of those questions are tangible.
They're about demographics.
They're about where you live, how many people you live with,
and whether you own your home or not.
That's about it.
We're not asking meaningful metrics.
We're not asking important questions.
We're not asking anything that's intangible.
something you've heard before, but you didn't realize it was him.
He said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer,
everything starts to look like a nail."
We've been fooled by our tool.
Excuse that expression.
(Laughter)
We've been fooled by our tool.
GDP has been our hammer.
And our nail has been a 19th- and 20th-century
industrial-era model of success.
And yet, 64 percent
of the world's GDP today
is in that intangible industry we call service,
the service industry, the industry I'm in.
And only 36 percent is in the tangible industries
of manufacturing and agriculture.
So maybe it's time that we get a bigger toolbox, right?
Maybe it's time we get a toolbox that
doesn't just count what's easily counted, the tangible in life,
but actually counts what we most value,
the things that are intangible.
I was also a curious economics major as an undergrad.
I learned that economists measure everything
in tangible units of production and consumption
as if each of those tangible units
is exactly the same.
They aren't the same.
In fact, as leaders, what we need to learn
is that we can influence
the quality of that unit of production
by creating the conditions
for our employees to live their calling.
In Vivian's case,
her unit of production
isn't the tangible hours she works,
it's the intangible difference she makes
during that one hour of work.
been a longtime guest at Vivian's motel.
He stayed there a hundred times
in the last 20 years,
and he's loyal to the property because of the relationship
that Vivian and her fellow employees have created with him.
They've created a habitat of happiness for Dave.
He tells me that he can always count
on Vivian and the staff there
to make him feel at home.
Why is it that
business leaders and investors
quite often don't see the connection
between creating the intangible
of employee happiness
with creating the tangible
of financial profits in their business?
We don't have to choose between
inspired employees and sizable profits,
we can have both.
In fact, inspired employees quite often
help make sizable profits, right?
in my opinion,
is business leaders and political leaders
who know what to count.
We count numbers.
We count on people.
What really counts is when we actually use our numbers
to truly take into account our people.
I learned that from a maid in a motel
and a king of a country.
What can you
start counting today?
What one thing can you start counting today
that actually would be meaningful in your life,
whether it's your work life or your business life?
(Music)
This is an ode to the mother goddess,
that most of us in India learn when we are children.
I learned it when I was four
at my mother's knee.
That year she introduced me to dance,
and thus began
my tryst with classical dance.
Since then -- it's been four decades now --
I've trained with the best in the field,
performed across the globe,
taught young and old alike,
created, collaborated,
choreographed,
and wove a rich tapestry
of artistry, achievement and awards.
The crowning glory was in 2007,
when I received this country's
fourth highest civilian award, the Padma Shri,
for my contribution to art.
for what I was to hear
on the first of July 2008.
I heard the word "carcinoma."
Yes, breast cancer.
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor's office,
I heard other words:
"cancer," "stage," "grade."
Until then, Cancer was the zodiac
sign of my friend,
stage was what I performed on,
and grades were what I got in school.
That day, I realized
I had an unwelcome, uninvited,
new life partner.
As a dancer,
I know the nine rasas or the navarasas:
anger, valor,
disgust, humor
and fear.
I thought I knew what fear was.
That day, I learned what fear was.
and the complete feeling of loss of control,
I shed copious tears
and asked my dear husband, Jayant.
I said, "Is this it? Is this the end of the road?
Is this the end of my dance?"
And he, the positive soul that he is,
said, "No, this is just a hiatus,
a hiatus during the treatment,
and you'll get back to doing what you do best."
that I, who thought I had complete control of my life,
had control of only three things:
My thought, my mind --
the images that these thoughts created --
and the action that derived from it.
So here I was wallowing
in a vortex of emotions
and depression and what have you,
with the enormity of the situation,
wanting to go to a place of healing, health and happiness.
I wanted to go from where I was
to where I wanted to be,
for which I needed something.
I needed something that would pull me out of all this.
So I dried my tears,
and I declared to the world at large ...
I said, "Cancer's only one page in my life,
and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life."
that I would ride it out,
and I would not allow cancer to ride me.
But to go from where I was
to where I wanted to be,
I needed something.
I needed an anchor, an image,
a peg
to peg this process on,
so that I could go from there.
And I found that in my dance,
my dance, my strength, my energy, my passion,
my very life breath.
But it wasn't easy.
Believe me, it definitely wasn't easy.
How do you keep cheer
when you go from beautiful
to bald in three days?
How do you not despair
when, with the body ravaged by chemotherapy,
climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture,
that to someone like me who could dance for three hours?
How do you not get overwhelmed
by the despair and the misery of it all?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep.
But I kept telling myself fear and tears
are options I did not have.
body, mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio,
and learn everything I learned
when I was four, all over again,
reworked, relearned, regrouped.
It was excruciatingly painful, but I did it.
Difficult.
I focused on my mudras,
on the imagery of my dance,
on the poetry and the metaphor
and the philosophy of the dance itself.
And slowly, I moved out
of that miserable state of mind.
I needed something to go that extra mile,
and I found it in that metaphor
which I had learned from my mother when I was four.
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini,
of Durga.
Durga, the mother goddess, the fearless one,
created by the pantheon of Hindu gods.
Durga, resplendent, bedecked, beautiful,
her 18 arms
ready for warfare,
as she rode astride her lion
into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur.
Durga, the epitome
of creative feminine energy,
or shakti.
Durga, the fearless one.
I made that image of Durga
and her every attribute, her every nuance,
my very own.
and the passion of my training,
I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance,
laser-sharp focus to such an extent
that I danced a few weeks after surgery.
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles,
much to the dismay of my oncologist.
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles
and badgered him to fit it
to my performing dance schedule.
What I had done
is I had tuned out of cancer
and tuned into my dance.
Yes, cancer has just been one page in my life.
is a story of overcoming setbacks,
obstacles and challenges
that life throws at you.
My story is the power of thought.
My story is the power of choice.
It's the power of focus.
It's the power of bringing ourselves
to the attention of something that so animates you,
so moves you,
that something even like cancer becomes insignificant.
My story is the power of a metaphor.
It's the power of an image.
Mine was that of Durga,
Durga the fearless one.
She was also called Simhanandini,
the one who rode the lion.
as I ride my own inner strength,
my own inner resilience,
armed as I am with what medication can provide
and continue treatment,
as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer,
asking my rogue cells to behave,
I want to be known not as a cancer survivor,
but as a cancer conqueror.
"Simhanandini."
I would be willing to bet I'm the dumbest guy in the room,
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.
What I've been really passionate about ever since --
and I've never spoken about this ever, until now --
and to groom them or show them
or be more focused or get a tutor.
Two years ago,
I was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.
It was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs
because no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.
Both my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs.
struggled with school.
I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.
So this thing right here is freaking me out.
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.
All three of the founders of Netscape had it.
I could go on and on.
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.
And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.
for 13 consecutive assignments.
But as an entrepreneur, you don't do accounting, you hire accountants.
So I just figured that out earlier.
I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook --
I open up chapter eight, talking about budgeting.
I told the author, after they did my interview,
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.
calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg
to find out how much they'd pay me for coat hangers.
And my mom came into the room and said,
I was going door to door in the neighborhood
to collect hangers to put in the basement,
and people would pay it, because it multiplied up.
and he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me, ever.
When I was about 10 years old, I sold comic books
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.
I would go biking up to the end of the beach,
buy all the comics from the poor kids,
So I'd collect tips and get payment.
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up.
And you could stuff pins in them.
Because people used to sew and they needed a pincushion.
so I spray-painted a whole bunch of them brown,
But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors
that if I land this client once,
and every week I get paid by that person,
Then I had the good ones that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.
And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.
And they could use those for practice balls.
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.
Then when the school shut me down --
So what, right? But you know what?
Stuff that down your shorts when you go to a football game,
I remember being told to walk out into the middle of a street
An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck.

Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you
on a journey of the underwater acoustic world
of whales and dolphins.
Since we are such a visual species,
it's hard for us to really understand this,
so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds
and hope this can communicate it.
But let's also think, as a visual species,
what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving
and try to look underwater.
We really can't see very far.
Our vision, which works so well in air,
all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.
And what marine mammals have evolved
over the last tens of millions of years
is ways to depend on sound
to both explore their world
and also to stay in touch with one another.
They can produce loud clicks
and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.
They can listen for echoes from prey
in order to decide where food is
All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.
So the large baleen whales
will produce long, beautiful songs,
which are used in reproductive advertisement
for male and females, both to find one another
and to select a mate.
And mother and young and closely bonded animals
use calls to stay in touch with one another,
so sound is really critical for their lives.
of these underwater animals,
whose world was so foreign to me,
was evidence from captive dolphins
that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.
And I mentioned I'll use
some visual representations of sounds.
Here's the first example.
This is a plot of frequency against time --
sort of like musical notation,
where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,
and time goes this way.
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle,
a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin
it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.
It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.
This is a calf in captivity
making an imitation
of that trainer's whistle.
If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat
and it hummed it back to you,
you ought to be pretty surprised.
Very few nonhuman mammals
can imitate sounds.
It's really important for our music and our language.
why do they do it?
A lot of my career has been devoted
to trying to understand
how these animals use their learning,
use the ability to change what you say
based on what you hear
in their own communication systems.
So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.
Many mammals have to produce contact calls
when, say, a mother and calf are apart.
This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys
when they're isolated from another one.
And you can see, there's not much
variability in these calls.
By contrast, the signature whistle
which dolphins use to stay in touch,
each individual here has a radically different call.
They can use this ability to learn calls
in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls
to identify individuals.
Well let's look at mothers and calves.
In normal life for mother and calf dolphin,
they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,
and when they separate
they have to get back together again.
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations
in which dolphins whistle,
against the maximum distance.
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,
less than half the time they need to use whistles.
Most of the time they can just find each other
just by swimming around.
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,
they need to use these individually distinctive whistles
to come back together again.
Most of these distinctive signature whistles
are quite stereotyped and stable
through the life of a dolphin.
But there are some exceptions.
it will often join up with another male
and form an alliance, which may last for decades.
As these two animals form a social bond,
their distinctive whistles actually converge
and become very similar.
This plot shows two members of a pair.
As you can see at the top here,
they share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."
They both have that kind of up-sweep.
Whereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."
And what's happened is
they've used this learning process
to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.
It's a very interesting way that they can
form a new identifier
for the new social group that they've had.
and see what this message can tell us
about protecting dolphins
from human disturbance.
Anybody looking at this picture
will know this dolphin is surrounded,
and clearly his behavior is being disrupted.
This is a bad situation.
But it turns out that when just a single boat
is approaching a group of dolphins
at a couple hundred meters away,
the dolphins will start whistling,
they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,
wait for the boat to go by,
and then they'll get back to normal business.
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,
the average interval between times
that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group
is six minutes.
So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,
it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have
to do their normal work.
Lars Bider has done work
comparing dolphin behavior and distribution
before there were dolphin-watching boats.
When there was one boat, not much of an impact.
And two boats: When the second boat was added,
what happened was that some of the dolphins
left the area completely.
Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.
When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,
this means that we have to be
quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.
We may need to regulate the intensity
of recreational boating and actual whale watching
in order to prevent these kinds of problems.
I'd also like to point out that sound
doesn't obey boundaries.
So you can draw a line to try to protect an area,
but chemical pollution and noise pollution
will continue to move through the area.
familiar, coastal environment
to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.
The world is mostly blue.
But I'd also like to point out that the oceans
are much more connected than we think.
Notice how few barriers there are to movement
across all of the oceans compared to land.
To me, the most mind-bending example
of the interconnectedness of the ocean
comes from an acoustic experiment
where oceanographers
took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,
deployed an underwater loudspeaker
and played back a sound.
That same sound
traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,
and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey --
the same sound.
are used to global communication,
but it's still amazing to me.
The ocean has properties
that allow low-frequency sound
to basically move globally.
The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.
It's nearly halfway around the globe.
In the early '70s,
Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician
published a theoretical paper
pointing out that it was possible
that sound could transmit over these large areas,
but very few biologists believed it.
even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,
the whales clearly have evolved,
over tens of millions of years,
a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.
So blue whales and fin whales
produce very low-frequency sounds
that can travel over very long ranges.
The top plot here shows
a complicated series of calls
that are repeated by males.
They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,
sort of like that of song birds.
Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females
that also carry over very long ranges.
of the long-range communication issue
well past the '70s,
until the end of the Cold War.
What happened was, during the Cold War,
the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,
that they used to track Russian submarines.
It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,
cabled to shore,
all wired back to a central place that could listen
to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.
And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available
to whale bio-acousticians
to see what they could hear.
who tracked one individual blue whale
as it passed by Bermuda,
went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.
It was tracked for 43 days,
swimming 1,700 kilometers,
or more than 1,000 miles.
This shows us both that the calls
are detectable over hundreds of miles
and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.
They're ocean-based and scale animals
who are communicating over much longer ranges
than we had anticipated.
disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,
the humpbacked whales congregate
in local traditional breeding grounds,
so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,
broader-band and more complicated.
So you're listening to the complicated song
produced by humpbacks here.
Humpbacks, when they develop
the ability to sing this song,
they're listening to other whales
and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,
just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.
This means that humpback song
is a form of animal culture,
just like music for humans would be.
comes from Australia.
Biologists on the east coast of Australia
were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.
And this orange line here marks the typical songs
of east coast humpbacks.
In '95 they all sang the normal song.
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs,
and it turned out that these strange songs
were typical of west coast whales.
The west coast calls became more and more popular,
until by 1998,
none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.
They just sang the cool new west coast song.
It's as if some new hit style
had completely wiped out
the old-fashioned style before,
and with no golden oldies stations.
Nobody sang the old ones.
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,
0.2 miles away from a humpback.
You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.
You sound very nearby.
The next recording you're going to hear
was made of the same humpback song
50 miles away.
That's shown down here.
You only hear the low frequencies.
You hear the reverberation
as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean
and is not quite as loud.
Now after I play back these humpback calls,
I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up
because they're so low in frequency
that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.
Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles,
which was distant for the humpback.
It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.
Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone
500 miles away.
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.
But you can still hear that faint call.
a potential for human impacts.
The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean
comes from shipping.
This is the sound of a ship,
and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.
There's a potential problem that maybe
this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales
from being able to hear each other.
Now this is something that's been known for quite a while.
And on the y-axis
is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean
by frequency.
In the low frequencies, this line indicates
sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.
Up high, these variable lines
indicate increasing noise in this frequency range
from higher wind and wave.
But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,
the noise is dominated by human ships.
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing:
That in this frequency range where whales communicate,
the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise
comes from human ships,
thousands of human ships, distant, far away,
just all aggregating.
on the range at which whales can communicate.
So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.
And as we get farther away,
the sound gets fainter and fainter.
Now in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,
this whale call could be easily detected.
It's louder than noise
at a range of a thousand kilometers.
Let's now take that additional increase in noise
that we saw comes from shipping.
All of a sudden, the effective range of communication
goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.
Now if this signal is used for males and females
to find each other for mating and they're dispersed,
imagine the impact this could have
on the recovery of endangered populations.
like I described for the dolphins.
I'll play the sound of a contact call used
by right whales to stay in touch.
And this is the kind of call that is used by,
say, right whale mothers and calves
as they separate to come back again.
Now imagine -- let's put the ship noise in the picture.
What's a mother to do
if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?
I'll describe a couple strategies.
and the noise is in this band,
you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band
and communicate better.
Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.
She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.
Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.
Look what happened by 2000 to the average call.
Same thing in the North Atlantic,
in the '50s versus 2000.
Over the last 50 years,
as we've put more noise into the oceans,
these whales have had to shift.
It's as if the whole population had to shift
from being basses to singing as a tenor.
It's an amazing shift, induced by humans
over this large scale,
in both time and space.
by calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,
by waiting for silence
and by shifting their call out of the noise band.
Now there's probably costs to calling louder
or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,
and there's probably lost opportunities.
If we also have to wait for silence,
they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.
So we have to be very concerned
about when the noise in habitats
degrades the habitat enough
that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,
or are not able to perform critical functions.
It's a really important problem.
very promising developments in this area,
looking at the impact of shipping on whales.
In terms of the shipping noise,
the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations
has formed a group whose job is to establish
guidelines for quieting ships,
to tell the industry how you could quiet ships.
And they've already found
that by being more intelligent about better propeller design,
you can reduce that noise by 90 percent.
If you actually insulate and isolate
the machinery of the ship from the hull,
you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.
So at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.
If this group can establish standards,
and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,
we can now see a gradual decline
in this potential problem.
and that's the problem of collision.
This is a whale that just squeaked by
a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.
But collision is a serious problem.
Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,
and it's very important to try to reduce this.
I'll discuss two very promising approaches.
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.
These black lines mark shipping lanes
in and out of the Bay of Fundy.
The colorized area
shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales
because of the ships moving in this lane.
It turns out that this lane here
goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,
and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.
Well, biologists
who couldn't take no for an answer
went to the International Maritime Organization
and petitioned them to say,
"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.
Can't you move them over to a place
where there's less of a risk?"
And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,
"These are the new lanes."
The shipping lanes have been moved.
And as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.
We can be very creative about thinking
of different ways to reduce these risks.
Another action which was just taken independently
by a shipping company itself
was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had
about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.
The Maersk Line looked at their competition
and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.
They rush as fast as they can to get to their port.
But then they often wait there.
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.
They could slow down by about 50 percent.
This reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,
which saved them money,
and at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.
It you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make
and you reduce the risk of collision.
you know, the whales live in
an amazing acoustic environment.
They've evolved over tens of millions of years
to take advantage of this.
And we need to be very attentive and vigilant
to thinking about where things that we do
may unintentionally prevent them
from being able to achieve their important activities.
At the same time, we need to be really creative
in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.
I hope these examples have shown
some of the different directions we can take
in addition to protected areas
to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate.
So, if you're in the audience today,
or maybe you're watching this talk in some other time or place,
you are a participant in the digital rights ecosystem.
Whether you're an artist, a technologist,
a lawyer or a fan,
the handling of copyright directly impacts your life.
Rights management is no longer
simply a question of ownership,
it's a complex web of relationships
and a critical part of our cultural landscape.
YouTube cares deeply about the rights of content owners,
but in order to give them choices about what they can do
with copies, mashups and more,
we need to first identify
when copyrighted material is uploaded to our site.
Two years ago, recording artist Chris Brown
released the official video of his single "Forever."
A fan saw it on TV,
recorded it with her camera phone,
and uploaded it to YouTube.
Because Sony Music had registered Chris Brown's video
in our Content ID system,
within seconds of attempting to upload the video,
the copy was detected,
giving Sony the choice of what to do next.
Well, it starts with content owners
delivering assets into our database,
along with a usage policy
that tells us what to do when we find a match.
We compare each upload
against all of the reference files in our database.
This heat map is going to show you
how the brain of the system works.
Here we can see the original reference file
being compared to the user generated content.
The system compares every moment
of one to the other to see if there's a match.
This means that we can identify a match
even if the copy used is just a portion of the original file,
plays it in slow motion
and has degraded audio and video quality.
And we do this every time
that a video is uploaded to YouTube.
And that's over 20 hours of video every minute.
When we find a match,
we apply the policy that the rights owner has set down.
is truly breathtaking.
We're not just talking about a few videos,
we're talking about over
100 years of video every day,
between new uploads and the legacy scans
we regularly do across all of the content on the site.
When we compare those hundred years of video,
we're comparing it against millions
of reference files in our database.
It would be like 36,000 people
staring at 36,000 monitors
each and every day, without so much as a coffee break.
Well, most rights owners, instead of blocking,
will allow the copy to be published.
And then they benefit through the exposure,
advertising and linked sales.
Remember Chris Brown's video "Forever"?
Well, it had its day in the sun and then it dropped off the charts,
and that looked like the end of the story,
but sometime last year, a young couple got married.
This is their wedding video.
You may have seen it.
if the processional of the wedding was this much fun,
can you imagine how much fun the reception must have been?
I mean, who are these people?
I totally want to go to that wedding.
to get over 40 million views.
And instead of Sony blocking,
they allowed the upload to occur.
And they put advertising against it
and linked from it to iTunes.
And the song, 18 months old,
went back to number four on the iTunes charts.
So Sony is generating revenue from both of these.
And Jill and Kevin, the happy couple,
they came back from their honeymoon
and found that their video had gone crazy viral.
And they've ended up on a bunch of talk shows,
and they've used it as an opportunity to make a difference.
The video's inspired over 26,000 dollars in donations
to end domestic violence.
The "JK Wedding [Entrance] Dance" became so popular
that NBC parodied it on the season finale of "The Office,"
which just goes to show,
it's truly an ecosystem of culture.
Because it's not just amateurs borrowing from big studios,
but sometimes big studios borrowing back.
And all it took to change things around
was to allow for choice through rights identification.
So why has no one ever solved this problem before?
It's because it's a big problem,
and it's complicated and messy.
It's not uncommon for a single video
to have multiple rights owners.
There's musical labels.
There's multiple music publishers.
And each of these can vary by country.
There's lots of cases
where we have more than one work mashed together.
So we have to manage many claims
to the same video.
But the system only works through
the participation of rights owners.
If you have content that others are uploading to YouTube,
you should register in the Content ID system,
and then you'll have the choice
about how your content is used.
And think carefully about the policies that you attach to that content.
By simply blocking all reuse,
you'll miss out on new art forms,
new audiences,
new distribution channels
and new revenue streams.
Just look at all the joy
that was spread through progressive rights management
and new technology.
And I think we can all agree that joy is definitely an idea worth spreading.
(Applause)
and I remember, at the time,
a box set of DVDs,
So I want to pick up from there
I mean, there is a major climate crisis, obviously,
and I think if people don't believe it, they should get out more.
and that we have to deal with with the same urgency.
but a crisis of human resources.
Very many people go through their whole lives
having no real sense of what their talents may be,
or if they have any to speak of.
who don't think they're really good at anything.
They get no great pleasure from what they do.
But I also meet people
They say, "But this is me, you know.
It would be foolish to abandon this,
because it speaks to my most authentic self."
And it's not true of enough people.
they're not just lying around on the surface.
but too often, it's not.
and it's not enough.
Innovation is hard,
is the tyranny of common sense.
"As our case is new,
We must disenthrall ourselves,
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to,
but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries.
But our minds are still hypnotized by them,
and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them.
It's very hard to know, by the way, what it is you take for granted.
How many of you here are over the age of 25?
could you put your hands up if you're wearing your wristwatch?
And so for us, if you want to know the time,
you have to wear something to tell it.
Kids now live in a world which is digitized,
and the time, for them, is everywhere.
They see no reason to do this.
And by the way, you don't need either;
it's just that you've always done it and you carry on doing it.
My daughter never wears a watch, my daughter Kate, who's 20.
She doesn't see the point.
And I say, "No, no, it tells the date as well."
One of them is the idea of linearity:
that it starts here and you go through a track
that life is not linear; it's organic.
We create our lives symbiotically
as we explore our talents
in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us.
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college.
Certain sorts of college.
There was this guy buying a book, he was in his 30s.
I asked, "How long have you been a fireman?"
"Always. I've always been a fireman."
because at school, everybody wanted to be a fireman."
This one teacher didn't take it seriously.
He said I was throwing my life away
if that's all I chose to do with it;
and I was wasting my talent to do that."
He said, "It was humiliating.
It was in front of the whole class and I felt dreadful.
You know, I was thinking about that guy recently,
He said, "I think he thinks better of me now."
And at the heart of our challenges --
which said, "College begins in kindergarten."
If we had time, I could go into this, but we don't.
there's such competition now to get into kindergarten --
to get to the right kindergarten --
The other is like Zagat and Michelin restaurants,
where everything is not standardized,
they're customized to local circumstances.
And we have sold ourselves into a fast-food model of education,
and it's impoverishing our spirit and our energies
as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies.
People have very different aptitudes.
at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar.
I could not get this thing to work
and what excites our spirit and our energy.
And if you're doing the thing that you love to do, that you're good at,
time takes a different course entirely.
but she disappears for hours on end.
You know this, if you're doing something you love,
We have to move to a model
that is based more on principles of agriculture.
it's an organic process.
under which they will begin to flourish.
There are great ones, like KIPP's; it's a great system.
There are many great models.
because it's not about scaling a new solution;
it's about creating a movement in education
but with external support based on a personalized curriculum.
in multimedia, in the Internet.
These technologies,
combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers,
Or at home, if that's what they choose,
And I wanted to just very quickly --
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant's songs last night,
I wanted to read you a quick, very short poem
and he was bewailing the fact
that he couldn't really give her what he thought she wanted from him.
And he says, "I've got something else, but it may not be for you."
Of night and light and the half-light,
And every day, everywhere,
our children spread their dreams beneath our feet.
So since I was here last in '06,
we discovered that global climate change
is turning out to be a pretty serious issue,
so we covered that fairly extensively
in Skeptic magazine.
We investigate all kinds
of scientific and quasi-scientific controversies,
but it turns out we don't have to worry about any of this
because the world's going to end in 2012.
You will recall I introduced you guys
to the Quadro Tracker.
It's like a water dowsing device.
It's just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around.
And you walk around, and it points to things.
Like if you're looking for marijuana in students' lockers,
it'll point right to somebody.
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)
This particular one that was given to me
finds golf balls,
especially if you're at a golf course
and you check under enough bushes.
Well, under the category of "What's the harm of silly stuff like this?"
this device, the ADE 651,
was sold to the Iraqi government
for 40,000 dollars apiece.
It's just like this one, completely worthless,
in which it allegedly worked by "electrostatic
magnetic ion attraction,"
which translates to
"pseudoscientific baloney" -- would be the nice word --
in which you string together a bunch of words that sound good,
but it does absolutely nothing.
In this case, at trespass points,
allowing people to go through
because your little tracker device said they were okay,
actually cost lives.
So there is a danger to pseudoscience,
in believing in this sort of thing.
I want to believe,
and you do too.
And in fact, I think my thesis here is that
belief is the natural state of things.
It is the default option. We just believe.
We believe all sorts of things.
Belief is natural;
disbelief, skepticism, science, is not natural.
It's more difficult.
It's uncomfortable to not believe things.
So like Fox Mulder on "X-Files,"
who wants to believe in UFOs? Well, we all do,
and the reason for that is because
we have a belief engine in our brains.
Essentially, we are pattern-seeking primates.
We connect the dots: A is connected to B; B is connected to C.
And sometimes A really is connected to B,
and that's called association learning.
whether it's Pavlov's dog here
associating the sound of the bell with the food,
and then he salivates to the sound of the bell,
or whether it's a Skinnerian rat,
in which he's having an association
between his behavior and a reward for it,
and therefore he repeats the behavior.
In fact, what Skinner discovered
is that, if you put a pigeon in a box like this,
and he has to press one of these two keys,
and he tries to figure out what the pattern is,
and you give him a little reward in the hopper box there --
if you just randomly assign rewards
such that there is no pattern,
they will figure out any kind of pattern.
And whatever they were doing just before they got the reward,
they repeat that particular pattern.
Sometimes it was even spinning around twice counterclockwise,
once clockwise and peck the key twice.
And that's called superstition,
and that, I'm afraid,
we will always have with us.
that is, the tendency to find meaningful patterns
in both meaningful and meaningless noise.
When we do this process, we make two types of errors.
A Type I error, or false positive,
is believing a pattern is real
when it's not.
Our second type of error is a false negative.
A Type II error is not believing
a pattern is real when it is.
So let's do a thought experiment.
You are a hominid three million years ago
walking on the plains of Africa.
Your name is Lucy, okay?
And you hear a rustle in the grass.
Is it a dangerous predator,
or is it just the wind?
Your next decision could be the most important one of your life.
Well, if you think that the rustle in the grass is a dangerous predator
and it turns out it's just the wind,
you've made an error in cognition,
made a Type I error, false positive.
But no harm. You just move away.
You're more cautious. You're more vigilant.
On the other hand, if you believe that the rustle in the grass is just the wind,
and it turns out it's a dangerous predator,
you're lunch.
You've just won a Darwin award.
You've been taken out of the gene pool.
patternicities will occur whenever the cost
of making a Type I error
is less than the cost of making a Type II error.
This is the only equation in the talk by the way.
We have a pattern detection problem
that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error
is highly problematic,
especially in split-second, life-and-death situations.
So the default position
is just: Believe all patterns are real --
All rustles in the grass are dangerous predators
and not just the wind.
And so I think that we evolved ...
there was a natural selection for the propensity for our belief engines,
our pattern-seeking brain processes,
to always find meaningful patterns
and infuse them with these sort of
predatory or intentional agencies that I'll come back to.
It's a horse head, that's right.
It looks like a horse. It must be a horse.
That's a pattern.
And is it really a horse?
Or is it more like a frog?
See, our pattern detection device,
which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex --
it's our little detection device there --
can be easily fooled, and this is the problem.
For example, what do you see here?
Yes, of course, it's a cow.
Once I prime the brain -- it's called cognitive priming --
once I prime the brain to see it,
it pops back out again even without the pattern that I've imposed on it.
And what do you see here?
Some people see a Dalmatian dog.
Yes, there it is. And there's the prime.
So when I go back without the prime,
your brain already has the model
so you can see it again.
What do you see here?
Planet Saturn. Yes, that's good.
How about here?
Just shout out anything you see.
That's a good audience, Chris.
Because there's nothing in this. Well, allegedly there's nothing.
at U.T. Austin
on corporate environments
and whether feelings of uncertainty and out of control
makes people see illusory patterns.
That is, almost everybody sees the planet Saturn.
People that are put in a condition of feeling out of control
are more likely to see something in this,
which is allegedly patternless.
In other words, the propensity to find these patterns
goes up when there's a lack of control.
For example, baseball players are notoriously superstitious
when they're batting,
but not so much when they're fielding.
Because fielders are successful
90 to 95 percent of the time.
The best batters fail seven out of 10 times.
So their superstitions, their patternicities,
are all associated with feelings of lack of control
and so forth.
Anybody see an object there?
There actually is something here,
but it's degraded.
While you're thinking about that,
this was an experiment done by Susan Blackmore,
a psychologist in England,
who showed subjects this degraded image
and then ran a correlation between
their scores on an ESP test:
How much did they believe in the paranormal,
supernatural, angels and so forth.
And those who scored high on the ESP scale,
tended to not only see
more patterns in the degraded images
but incorrect patterns.
Here is what you show subjects.
The fish is degraded 20 percent, 50 percent
and then the one I showed you,
70 percent.
named Peter Brugger,
who found significantly more meaningful patterns
were perceived on the right hemisphere,
via the left visual field, than the left hemisphere.
So if you present subjects the images such
that it's going to end up on the right hemisphere instead of the left,
then they're more likely to see patterns
than if you put it on the left hemisphere.
Our right hemisphere appears to be
where a lot of this patternicity occurs.
So what we're trying to do is bore into the brain
to see where all this happens.
gave subjects L-DOPA.
L-DOPA's a drug, as you know, given for treating Parkinson's disease,
which is related to a decrease in dopamine.
L-DOPA increases dopamine.
An increase of dopamine caused
subjects to see more patterns
than those that did not receive the dopamine.
So dopamine appears to be the drug
associated with patternicity.
In fact, neuroleptic drugs
that are used to eliminate psychotic behavior,
things like paranoia, delusions
and hallucinations,
these are patternicities.
They're incorrect patterns. They're false positives. They're Type I errors.
And if you give them drugs
that are dopamine antagonists,
they go away.
That is, you decrease the amount of dopamine,
and their tendency to see
patterns like that decreases.
On the other hand, amphetamines like cocaine
are dopamine agonists.
They increase the amount of dopamine.
So you're more likely to feel in a euphoric state,
creativity, find more patterns.
talk about how he thought he was much funnier
when he was doing cocaine, when he had that issue, than now.
So perhaps more dopamine
is related to more creativity.
Dopamine, I think, changes
our signal-to-noise ratio.
That is, how accurate we are
in finding patterns.
If it's too low, you're more likely to make too many Type II errors.
You miss the real patterns. You don't want to be too skeptical.
If you're too skeptical, you'll miss the really interesting good ideas.
Just right, you're creative, and yet you don't fall for too much baloney.
Too high and maybe you see patterns everywhere.
Every time somebody looks at you, you think people are staring at you.
You think people are talking about you.
And if you go too far on that, that's just simply
labeled as madness.
It's a distinction perhaps we might make
between two Nobel laureates, Richard Feynman
and John Nash.
One sees maybe just the right number
of patterns to win a Nobel Prize.
The other one also, but maybe too many patterns.
And we then call that schizophrenia.
And of course you all know exactly
what this is, right?
And what pattern do you see here?
Again, I'm putting your anterior cingulate cortex to the test here,
causing you conflicting pattern detections.
You know, of course, this is Via Uno shoes.
These are sandals.
Pretty sexy feet, I must say.
Maybe a little Photoshopped.
And of course, the ambiguous figures
that seem to flip-flop back and forth.
It turns out what you're thinking about a lot
influences what you
tend to see.
And you see the lamp here, I know.
Because the lights on here.
Of course, thanks to the environmentalist movement
we're all sensitive to the plight of marine mammals.
So what you see in this particular ambiguous figure
is, of course, the dolphins, right?
You see a dolphin here,
and there's a dolphin,
and there's a dolphin.
That's a dolphin tail there, guys.
your ACC is going to be going into hyperdrive.
If you look down here, it's fine. If you look up here, then you get conflicting data.
And then we have to flip the image
for you to see that it's a set up.
The impossible crate illusion.
It's easy to fool the brain in 2D.
So you say, "Aw, come on Shermer, anybody can do that
in a Psych 101 text with an illusion like that."
Well here's the late, great Jerry Andrus'
"impossible crate" illusion in 3D,
in which Jerry is standing inside
the impossible crate.
And he was kind enough to post this
and give us the reveal.
Of course, camera angle is everything. The photographer is over there,
and this board appears to overlap with this one, and this one with that one, and so on.
But even when I take it away,
the illusion is so powerful because of how are brains are wired
to find those certain kinds of patterns.
that throws us off because of the conflicting patterns
of comparing this angle with that angle.
In fact, it's the exact same picture side by side.
So what you're doing is comparing that angle
instead of with this one, but with that one.
And so your brain is fooled.
Yet again, your pattern detection devices are fooled.
because we have an additional evolved
facial recognition software
in our temporal lobes.
Here's some faces on the side of a rock.
I'm actually not even sure if this is -- this might be Photoshopped.
But anyway, the point is still made.
Now which one of these looks odd to you?
In a quick reaction, which one looks odd?
The one on the left. Okay. So I'll rotate it
so it'll be the one on the right.
And you are correct.
A fairly famous illusion -- it was first done with Margaret Thatcher.
Now, they trade up the politicians every time.
Well, why is this happening?
Well, we know exactly where it happens,
in the temporal lobe, right across, sort of above your ear there,
in a little structure called the fusiform gyrus.
And there's two types of cells that do this,
that record facial features either globally,
or specifically these large, rapid-firing cells,
first look at the general face.
So you recognize Obama immediately.
And then you notice something quite
a little bit odd about the eyes and the mouth.
Especially when they're upside down,
you're engaging that general facial recognition software there.
you're a hominid walking on the plains of Africa.
Is it just the wind or a dangerous predator?
What's the difference between those?
Well, the wind is inanimate;
the dangerous predator is an intentional agent.
And I call this process agenticity.
That is the tendency to infuse patterns
with meaning, intention and agency,
often invisible beings from the top down.
This is an idea that we got
from a fellow TEDster here, Dan Dennett,
who talked about taking the intentional stance.
souls, spirits, ghosts, gods, demons, angels,
aliens, intelligent designers,
government conspiracists
and all manner of invisible agents
with power and intention, are believed
to haunt our world and control our lives.
I think it's the basis of animism
and polytheism and monotheism.
It's the belief that aliens are somehow
more advanced than us, more moral than us,
and the narratives always are
that they're coming here to save us and rescue us from on high.
The intelligent designer's always portrayed
as this super intelligent, moral being
that comes down to design life.
Even the idea that government can rescue us --
that's no longer the wave of the future,
but that is, I think, a type of agenticity:
projecting somebody up there,
big and powerful, will come rescue us.
There's somebody hiding behind there pulling the strings,
whether it's the Illuminati
or the Bilderbergers.
But this is a pattern detection problem, isn't it?
Some patterns are real and some are not.
Was JFK assassinated by a conspiracy or by a lone assassin?
Well, if you go there -- there's people there on any given day --
like when I went there, here -- showing me where the different shooters were.
My favorite one was he was in the manhole.
And he popped out at the last second, took that shot.
But of course, Lincoln was assassinated by a conspiracy.
So we can't just uniformly dismiss
all patterns like that.
Because, let's face it, some patterns are real.
Some conspiracies really are true.
Explains a lot, maybe.
We did a whole issue on it.
Nineteen members of Al Queda plotting to fly planes into buildings
constitutes a conspiracy.
But that's not what the "9/11 truthers" think.
They think it was an inside job by the Bush administration.
Well, that's a whole other lecture.
You know how we know that 9/11
was not orchestrated by the Bush administration?
Because it worked.
Our agenticity process comes from
the fact that we can enjoy movies like these.
Because we can imagine, in essence,
continuing on.
We know that if you stimulate the temporal lobe,
you can produce a feeling of out-of-body experiences,
near-death experiences,
which you can do by just touching an electrode to the temporal lobe there.
Or you can do it through loss of consciousness,
by accelerating in a centrifuge.
You get a hypoxia, or a lower oxygen.
And the brain then senses
that there's an out-of-body experience.
You can use -- which I did, went out and did --
Michael Persinger's God Helmet,
that bombards your temporal lobes with electromagnetic waves.
And you get a sense of out-of-body experience.
that sort of brings all this together.
It's just a minute and a half.
It ties together all this into the power of expectation and the power of belief.
Go ahead and roll it.
for an advert for lip balm.
in a national commercial, right?
And this is test on some lip balms
that we have over here.
And these are our models who are going to help us,
Roger and Matt.
And we have our own lip balm,
and we have a leading brand.
Would you have any problem
kissing our models to test it?
I'm going to ask you to go ahead
and put a blindfold on.
Kay, now can you see anything? (Girl: No.)
Pull it so you can't even see down. (Girl: Okay.)
is how it protects your lips,
the texture, right,
and maybe if you can discern any flavor or not.
Okay, now I'm going to ask you to pucker up.
Pucker up big and lean in just a little bit, okay?
And, Jennifer, how did that feel?
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.
The debate is over the proposition:
"What the world needs now
is nuclear energy." True or false?
And before we have the debate,
I'd like to actually take a show of hands --
on balance, right now, are you for or against this?
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."
Okay, hands down.
Those who are against, raise your hands.
Okay, I'm reading that at about
75 to 25 in favor at the start.
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end
and see how that shifts, if at all.
So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,
and then after one little, quick exchange between them,
I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience
to have 30 seconds
to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.
is one of, truly, the founders of the
environmental movement,
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.
(Applause)
The saying is that with climate, those who know the most
are the most worried.
With nuclear, those who know the most
are the least worried.
A classic example is James Hansen,
a NASA climatologist
pushing for 350 parts per million
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.
He came out with a wonderful book recently
called "Storms of My Grandchildren."
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,
as are most climatologists
who are engaging this issue seriously.
a planet that is facing climate change
and is now half urban.
Look at the client base for this.
Five out of six of us
live in the developing world.
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.
And we are educating our kids,
having fewer kids,
basically good news all around.
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,
is electricity.
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.
This is one of the most desired things
by poor people all over the world,
in the cities and in the countryside.
Electricity for cities, at its best,
is what's called baseload electricity.
That's where it is on
all the time.
And so far there are only three major sources of that --
coal and gas, hydro-electric,
which in most places is maxed-out --
and nuclear.
I would love to have something in the fourth place here,
but in terms of constant, clean,
scalable energy,
[solar] and wind and the other renewables
aren't there yet because they're inconstant.
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.
the main thing you want to look at
is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,
the two major sources of electricity.
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,
the waste from that lifetime of electricity
would go in a Coke can --
a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.
But one day of coal
adds up to one hell of a lot
of carbon dioxide
in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.
Then what happens to the waste?
The nuclear waste typically goes into
a dry cask storage
out back of the parking lot at the reactor site
because most places don't have underground storage yet.
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.
While the carbon dioxide,
vast quantities of it, gigatons,
goes into the atmosphere
where we can't get it back -- yet --
and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.
So when you add up the greenhouse gases
in the lifetime of these various energy sources,
nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,
below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.
I love being around these
big wind generators.
But one of the things we're discovering is that
wind, like solar, is an actually relatively
dilute source of energy.
And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,
a very large footprint in terms of materials,
five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,
and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity
is on the order of 250 square miles
of wind farm.
In places like Denmark and Germany,
they've maxed out on wind already.
They've run out of good sites.
The power lines are getting overloaded.
And you peak out.
Likewise, with solar,
especially here in California,
we're discovering that the 80 solar farm
schemes that are going forward
want to basically bulldoze
1,000 square miles of southern California desert.
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.
Solar's wonderful on rooftops.
But out in the landscape,
one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles
of bulldozed desert.
Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out
what would it take
to get 13 clean
terawatts of energy
from wind, solar and biofuels,
and that area would be roughly the size of the United States,
an area he refers to as "Renewistan."
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,
a physicist in England,
and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,
he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."
the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.
We have been taking down
the Russian warheads,
turning it into electricity.
Ten percent of American electricity
comes from decommissioned warheads.
We haven't even started the American stockpile.
I think of most interest to a TED audience
would be the new generation of reactors
that are very small,
down around 10
to 125 megawatts.
This is one from Toshiba.
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.
Typically, these things are put in the ground.
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.
They're incredibly safe,
weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico
called the Hyperion,
and another one from Oregon called NuScale.
Babcock & Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,
here's an integral fast reactor.
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.
The governments of the world are going to have to decide
that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.
And here's the future.
(Applause)
So arguing against,
a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart
of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.
In 2000, he discovered that soot
was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.
His team have been making detailed calculations
of the relative impacts
of different energy sources.
His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --
from Stanford,
Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.
(Applause)
So my premise here is that nuclear energy
puts out more carbon dioxide,
puts out more air pollutants,
enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up
than real renewable energy systems,
namely wind, solar,
geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.
So let's start just by looking at the
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions
of all the greenhouse gases and particles
that cause warming
and converted to CO2.
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar
have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.
One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry
estimate of nuclear.
The high is the average of 103
scientific, peer-reviewed studies.
And this is just the
CO2 from the life cycle.
it takes between 10 and 19 years
to put up a nuclear power plant
from planning to operation.
This includes about three and a half to six years
for a site permit.
and another two and a half to four years
for a construction permit and issue,
and then four to nine years for actual construction.
And in China, right now,
they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.
And the average, just for the construction time of these,
is 7.1 years
on top of any planning times.
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,
you have to run the regular electric power grid,
which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.
And the chart here shows the difference between
the emissions from the regular grid,
resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,
versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.
Wind takes about two to five years on average,
same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.
So the difference is the opportunity cost
of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.
So if you add these two together, alone,
you can see a separation
that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times
more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.
And this doesn't even account
for the footprint on the ground.
this is the number of deaths per year in 2020
just from vehicle exhaust.
Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States
to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles
or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.
Well, right now in the United States,
50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,
and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000
due to improvements.
And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,
the death rates of 2020.
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,
you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.
If you go to nuclear,
you do get a big reduction,
but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.
that nuclear weapons proliferation
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,
because we know for example,
India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly
by enriching uranium
in nuclear energy facilities.
North Korea did that to some extent.
Iran is doing that right now.
And Venezuela would be doing it
if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.
If you do a large scale expansion
of nuclear energy across the world,
and as a result there was just one
nuclear bomb created
that was used to destroy a city
such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,
the additional death rates due to this
averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.
would be this.
So, do we need this?
Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind
is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.
That, because the footprint, as you can see,
is just the pole touching the ground.
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet
with 73,000 to 145,000
five-megawatt wind turbines.
That would take between one and three square kilometers
of footprint on the ground, entirely.
The spacing is something else.
That's the footprint that is always being confused.
People confuse footprint with spacing.
As you can see from these pictures,
the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes
including agricultural land,
range land or open space.
Over the ocean, it's not even land.
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)
With nuclear, what do we have?
We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone
that's 17 square kilometers.
And you have the uranium mining
that you have to deal with.
lots is worse than nuclear or wind.
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,
this is how much land you would need.
That's cellulosic, second generation
biofuels from prairie grass.
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.
This is based on ranges from data,
but if you look at nuclear,
it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.
For wind, there's a larger area,
but much smaller footprint.
And of course, with wind,
you could put it all over the East Coast,
offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.
And now, if you go back to
looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,
and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,
but it's still pretty small.
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,
you would need about one percent of world land.
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.
You can do that by combining renewables.
This is from real data in California,
looking at wind data and solar data.
And it considers just using existing hydro
to match the hour-by-hour power demand.
Here are the world wind resources.
There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide
than we need for all the world.
So then here's the final ranking.
And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:
You can either have wind or nuclear.
If you use wind,
you guarantee ice will last.
Nuclear, the time lag alone
will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky
or an uncertain future with nuclear power.
So while they're having their comebacks on each other --
and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --
I need two people from either side.
So if you're for this,
if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.
If you're against, put up one.
And I want two of each for the mics.
Now then, you guys have --
you have a minute comeback on him
to pick up a point he said, challenge it,
whatever.
has to do with weapons
and energy.
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow
putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --
a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable
and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"
which is kind of finessing it
a little bit, I think.
The reality is that there's, what,
21 nations that have nuclear power?
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.
In every case, they got the weapons
before they got the nuclear power.
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,
that have nuclear weapons
and don't have nuclear power at all.
The places that we would most like to have
really clean energy occur
are China, India, Europe, North America,
all of which have sorted out their situation
in relation to nuclear weapons.
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,
maybe Venezuela,
that you would like to have very close
surveillance of anything
that goes on with fissile stuff.
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we
really know where all of the fissile material is,
and we can move toward
zero weapons left, once we know all that.
30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.
and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.
There's plenty of solar and wind.
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.
That's from real data.
And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.
Solving the world's problems can be done,
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.
Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.
I've been involved in global warming policy
since 1994,
when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund
that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.
I've come around in the last 10 years.
I used to be against nuclear power.
I'm now supporting Stewart's position,
softly, from a risk-management standpoint,
agreeing that
the risks of overheating the planet
outweigh the risk of nuclear incident,
which certainly is possible and is a very real problem.
However, I think there may be a win-win solution here
where both parties can win this debate,
and that is, we face a situation
where it's carbon caps on this planet
or die.
And in the United States Senate,
we need bipartisan support --
only one or two votes are needed --
to move global warming through the Senate,
and this room can help.
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.
The first is: be aware of the propaganda.
The propaganda from the industry
has been very, very strong.
And we have not had
the other side of the argument fully aired
so that people can draw their own conclusions.
Be very aware of the propaganda.
Secondly, think about this.
If we build all these nuclear power plants,
all that waste
is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,
of trucks and trains,
moving through this country every day.
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.
Tell me that those accidents aren't going to
put material into the environment
that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.
And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains
isn't a potential terrorist target.
For.
Anyone else for? Go.
I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.
I've got solar PV on my roof.
I've got a hydro conversion
at a watermill that I own.
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.
However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.
The capability of
the sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,
simply isn't enough to add up.
So if we want to keep the lights on,
we actually need a solution
which is going to keep generating all of the time.
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,
and I continue to do so now.
But we've got an opportunity
to recycle them into something more useful
that enables us to get energy all of the time.
And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.
We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.
We need a solution that generates all of the time.
If we're going to keep the lights on,
nuclear is that solution.
Anyone else against?
that we don't have enough
alternative renewable resources.
And our "against" proponent up here
made it very clear that we actually do.
And so the fallacy
that we need this resource
and we can actually make it in a time frame
that is meaningful is not possible.
I will also add one other thing.
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks --
we know that the stick is going up exponentially.
So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables
and say, "That's all we have."
Because five years from now, it will blow you away
what we'll actually have as alternatives
to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.
30 seconds each
to sum up.
Your final pitch, Stewart.
that you had there.
It was a sunny day and a windy night.
And just now in England
they had a cold spell.
All of the wind in the entire country
shut down for a week.
None of those things were stirring.
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.
This keeps happening.
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.
And the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel
in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.
And especially the small reactors need to go forward.
I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point --
it'll take an act of Congress
to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission
start moving quickly on these small reactors,
which we need very much, here and in the world.
power demand and supply,
looking at solar, wind, using data for California.
And you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,
for the whole year almost.
Now, with regard to the resources,
we've developed the first wind map of the world,
from data alone, at 80 meters.
We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.
And there's much more solar than there is wind.
There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.
(Applause)
So if you were in Palm Springs ...
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.
(Applause)
I put it to you that what the world needs now
is nuclear energy.
All those in favor, raise your hands.
(Shouts)
And all those against.
Ooooh.
Now that is -- my take on that ...
Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,
who voted differently.
Those of you who changed your mind
in favor of "for"
put your hands up.
Okay. So here's the read on it.
Both people won supporters,
but on my count,
the mood of the TED community shifted
from about 75 to 25
to about 65 to 35
in favor, in favor.
Thank you for that.
In Africa we say,
"God gave the white man a watch
and gave the black man time."
I think, how is it possible
for a man with so much time
to tell his story in 18 minutes?
I think it will be quite a challenge for me.
they talk about famine,
HIV and AIDS,
poverty or war.
But my story that I would like to share with you today
is the one about success.
It is about a country
in the southwest of Africa
called Namibia.
Namibia has got 2.1 million people,
but it is only twice the size of California.
in the remote northwest part of the country.
It's called Kunene region.
And in the center of Kunene region
is the village of Sesfontein. This is where I was born.
This is where I'm coming from.
Most people that are following the story
of Angelina Jolie
and Brad Pitt
will know where Namibia is.
They love Namibia
for its beautiful dunes,
that are even taller
than the Empire State Building.
Wind and time have twisted our landscape
into very strange shapes,
and these shapes are speckled with wildlife
that has become so adapted
to this harsh and strange land.
You might wonder, why are you wearing these Western clothes?
I'm a Himba and Namibian.
A Himba is one of the 29
ethnic groups in Namibia.
We live a very traditional lifestyle.
I grew up herding,
looking after our livestock --
goats, sheep and cattle.
And one day,
my father actually took me into the bush.
He said, "John,
I want you to become a good herder.
Boy, if you are looking after our livestock
and you see a cheetah
eating our goat --
cheetah is very nervous --
just walk up to it.
Walk up to it and smack it on the backside."
(Laughter)
"And he will let go of the goat
and run off."
But then he said,
"Boy, if you run into a lion,
don't move.
Don't move. Stand your ground.
Puff up and just look it in the eye
and it may not want to fight you."
(Laughter)
But then, he said,
"If you see a leopard,
boy, you better run like hell."
(Laughter)
"Imagine you run faster than those goats you are looking after."
In this way --
(Laughter)
In this way, I actually started to learn about nature.
and in addition to being a Himba
I'm also a trained conservationist.
And it is very important if you are in the field
to know what to confront
and what to run from.
I was born in 1971.
We lived under apartheid regime.
The whites could farm, graze
and hunt as they wished,
but we black, we were not regarded as responsible
to use wildlife.
Whenever we tried to hunt,
we were called poachers.
And as a result, we were fined and locked up in jail.
the U.S. and Soviet interests
fought for control over my country.
And you know, during war time,
there are militaries, armies, that are moving around.
And the army hunted for valuable rhino horns
and tusks.
They could sell these things for anything between
$5,000 a kilo.
During the same year
almost every Himba had a rifle.
Because it was wartime,
the British .303 rifle
was just all over the whole country.
we had a very big drought.
It killed almost everything that was left.
Our livestock was
almost at the brink of extinction,
protected as well.
We were hungry.
I remember a night
when a hungry leopard
went into the house
of one of our neighbors
and took a sleeping child out of the bed.
It's a very sad story.
But even today,
that memory is still in people's minds.
They can pinpoint the exact location
where this all happened.
And then, in the same year,
we almost lost everything.
And my father said, "Why don't you just go to school?"
And they sent me off to school, just to get busy somewhere there.
my father actually got a job with a non-governmental organization
called IRDNC, Integrated Rural Development and Nature Conservation.
They actually spend a lot of time a year in the communities.
They were trusted by the local communities
like our leader, Joshua Kangombe.
Joshua Kangombe saw what was happening:
wildlife disappearing,
poaching was skyrocketing,
and the situation seemed very hopeless.
Death and despair surrounded Joshua
and our entire communities.
What if we pay people that you trust
to look after wildlife?
Do you have anybody in your communities, or people,
that know the bush very well
and that know wildlife very well?
The headman said: "Yes. Our poachers."
"Eh? The poachers?"
"Yes. Our poachers."
And that was my father.
My father has been a poacher for quite a long time.
Instead of shooting poachers dead
like they were doing elsewhere in Africa,
IRDNC has helped men reclaim their abilities
to manage their peoples
and their rights to own and manage wildlife.
And thus, as people started feeling ownership over wildlife,
wildlife numbers started coming back,
and that's actually becoming a foundation for conservation in Namibia.
With independence, the whole approach of community getting involved
was embraced by our new government.
The very first one is
honoring of tradition and being open to new ideas.
Here is our tradition:
At every Himba village, there is a sacred fire.
And at this sacred fire, the spirit of our ancestors
speak through the headman
and advise us where to get water,
where to get grazings,
and where to go and hunt.
And I think this is the best way of regulating ourselves
on the environment.
And here are the new ideas.
Transporting rhinos using helicopters
I think is much easier
than talking through a spirit that you can't see, isn't it?
And these things we were taught by outsiders.
We learned these things from outsiders.
We needed new boundaries to describe our traditional lands;
we needed to learn more things like GPS
just to see whether --
can GPS really reflect the true reflection of the land
or is this just a thing made somewhere in the West?
And we then wanted to see whether we can match our
ancestral maps with digital maps made somewhere in the world.
And through this,
we actually started realizing our dreams,
and we maintained honoring our traditions
but we were still open to new ideas.
a better life where we can benefit through many things.
Most poachers, like my father,
were people from our own community.
They were not people from outside.
These were our own people.
And sometimes, once they were caught,
they were treated with respect, brought back into the communities
and they were made part of the bigger dreams.
The best one, like my father -- I'm not campaigning for my father --
(Laughter)
they were put in charge to stop others from poaching.
And when this thing started going on,
we started becoming one community,
renewing our connection to nature.
And that was a very strong thing in Namibia.
was the partnerships.
Our government has given legal status over our traditional lands.
The other partners that we have got
is business communities.
Business communities helped bring Namibia onto the world map
and they have also helped make wildlife
a very valuable land use like any other land uses
such as agriculture.
And most of my conservation colleagues today
that you find in Namibia
have been trained through the initiative,
through the involvement of World Wildlife Fund
in the most up-to-date conservation practices.
They have also given funding for two decades
to this whole program.
And so far, with the support of World Wildlife Fund,
we've been able to scale up the very small programs
to national programs today.
Namibia ... or Sesfontein
was no more an isolated village somewhere,
hidden away in Namibia.
With these assets we are now part of the global village.
since my father's first job as a community game guard.
It's very unfortunate that he passed away and he cannot see the success
as I and my children see it today.
When I finished school in 1995,
there were only 20 lions in the entire Northwest -- in our area.
But today, there are more than 130 lions.
(Applause)
So please, if you go to Namibia,
make sure that you stay in the tents.
Don't walk out at night!
But today, Kunene has the largest concentration of black rhino --
free-roaming black rhinos -- in the world.
This is outside the protected area.
but they are now far away from our village,
because the natural plain has multiplied,
like zebras, springboks and everything.
They stay very much far away
because this other thing has multiplied
from less than a thousand to tens of thousands of animals.
community rangers getting community involved,
has now grown into something that we call conservancies.
Conservancies are legally instituted institutions
by the government,
and these are run by the communities themselves, for their benefit.
Today, we have got 60 conservancies
that manage and protect over 13 million hectares
of land in Namibia.
We have already reshaped conservation in the entire country.
Nowhere else in the world
has community-adopted conservation at this scale.
This is our new economy --
an economy based on the respect of our natural resources.
And we are able to use this money for many things:
Very importantly, we put it in education.
Secondly, we put it for infrastructure. Food.
Very important as well -- we invest this money in AIDS and HIV education.
You know that Africa is being affected by these viruses.
And this is the good news from Africa
that we have to shout from the rooftops.
is for you to help me and our partners
take some of what we have learned in Namibia
to other places with similar problems:
places like Mongolia,
or even in your own backyards,
the Northern Great Plains,
where buffalo and other animals have suffered
and many communities are in decline.
I like that one:
Namibia serving as a model to Africa,
and Africa serving as a model to the United States.
(Applause)
We were successful in Namibia
because we dreamed of a future
that was much more than just a healthy wildlife.
We knew conservation would fail
if it doesn't work to improve the lives of the local communities.
So, come and talk to me about Namibia,
and better yet, come to Namibia
and see for yourself how we have done it.
And please, do visit our website
to learn more and see how you can help CBNRM
in Africa and across the world.
Thank you very much.
This is the venue
where, as a young man,
some of the music that I wrote was first performed.
It was, remarkably,
a pretty good sounding room.
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,
it actually sounded pretty good.
This is a song that was recorded there.
(Music)
This is not Talking Heads,
in the picture anyway.
(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)
So the nature of the room
meant that words could be understood.
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.
The sound system was kind of decent.
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.
So the rhythms
could be pretty intact too,
pretty concise.
Other places around the country had similar rooms.
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.
The music was in some ways different,
but in structure and form,
very much the same.
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.
And so the bands at Tootsie's
or at CBGB's
had to play loud enough --
the volume had to be loud enough to overcome
people falling down, shouting out
and doing whatever else they were doing.
that are much nicer.
I've played the Disney Hall here
and Carnegie Hall and places like that.
And it's been very exciting.
But I also noticed that sometimes the music
that I had written,
or was writing at the time,
didn't sound all that great
in some of those halls.
We managed,
but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited
to the music I was making
or had made.
So I asked myself:
Do I write stuff
for specific rooms?
Do I have a place, a venue,
in mind when I write?
Is that a kind of model for creativity?
Do we all make things with
a venue, a context, in mind?
(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)
Most of the popular music that we know now
has a big part of its roots in West Africa.
And the music there,
I would say, the instruments,
the intricate rhythms,
the way it's played, the setting, the context,
it's all perfect. It all works perfect.
The music works perfectly in that setting.
There's no big room
to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.
The instruments are loud enough
that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.
It's no accident.
It's perfect for that particular context.
And it would be a mess
in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.
(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.
It doesn't change key, the notes are long,
there's almost no rhythm whatsoever,
and the room flatters the music.
It actually improves it.
This is the room that Bach
wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral,
so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.
He can, very innovatively,
actually change keys
without risking huge dissonances.
(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.
They're smaller, even less reverberant,
so he can write really frilly music
that's very intricate -- and it works.
(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)
It fits the room perfectly.
This is La Scala.
It's around the same time,
I think it was built around 1776.
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,
they used to yell out to one another.
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,
just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.
If they liked an aria,
they would holler and suggest
that it be done again as an encore,
not at the end of the show, but immediately.
(Laughter)
And well, that was an opera experience.
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.
And the size of the room is not that big.
It's smaller than this.
But Wagner made an innovation.
He wanted a bigger band.
He wanted a little more bombast,
so he increased the size of the orchestra pit
so he could get more low-end instruments in there.
(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)
This is Carnegie Hall.
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.
And they're a lot more reverberant
than La Scala.
Around the same,
according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,
this kind of rule came into effect
that audiences had to be quiet --
no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,
or gossiping with one another
during the show.
They had to be very quiet.
So those two things combined meant that
a different kind of music
worked best in these kind of halls.
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,
which there weren't in some of these
other kinds of music.
Quiet parts could be heard
that would have been drowned out
by all the gossiping and shouting.
But because of the reverberation
in those rooms like Carnegie Hall,
the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic
and a little more textural.
(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)
This is Mahler.
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.
That was Bob's last record, yeah.
This is a jazz band.
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing
on riverboats and clubs.
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections
that the dancers really liked.
And they'd say, "Play that part again."
Well, there's only so many times
you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.
And a new form of music was born.
(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)
These are played mainly in small rooms.
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.
So the music has to be loud enough
to be heard above that.
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century --
for the whole of 20th-century popular music,
whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.
when this became
one of the primary venues for music.
And this was one way
that the music got there.
Microphones enabled singers, in particular,
and musicians and composers,
to completely change the kind of music
that they were writing.
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,
but singers, like Frank Sinatra,
could use the mic
and do things
that they could never do without a microphone.
Other singers after him
went even further.
(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)
This is Chet Baker.
And this kind of thing
would have been impossible without a microphone.
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.
And he's singing right into your ear.
He's whispering into your ears.
The effect is just electric.
It's like the guy is sitting next to you,
whispering who knows what into your ear.
There's live music,
and there's recorded music.
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque,
and there's jukeboxes in bars,
where you don't even need to have a band.
There doesn't need to be any
live performing musicians whatsoever,
and the sound systems are good.
People began to make music
specifically for discos
and for those sound systems.
And, as with jazz,
the dancers liked certain sections
more than they did others.
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.
(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)
The MC would improvise lyrics
in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.
And another new form of music was born.
ended up in what is probably, acoustically,
the worst sounding venues on the planet:
sports stadiums,
basketball arenas and hockey arenas.
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.
They wrote what is now called arena rock,
which is medium-speed ballads.
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)
They did the best they could
given that this is what they're writing for.
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.
It's more a social situation
than a musical situation.
And in some ways, the music
that they're writing for this place
works perfectly.
One of the new ones is the automobile.
I grew up with a radio in a car.
But now that's evolved into something else.
The car is a whole venue.
(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)
The music that, I would say, is written
for automobile sound systems
works perfectly on it.
It might not be what you want to listen to at home,
but it works great in the car --
has a huge frequency spectrum,
you know, big bass and high-end
and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.
the private MP3 player.
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.
(Laughter)
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,
or when the audience had to hush up,
because you can now hear every single detail.
In other ways, it's more like the West African music
because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,
you turn it up, and the next minute,
your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.
So that doesn't really work.
I think pop music, mainly,
it's written today,
to some extent, is written for these kind of players,
for this kind of personal experience
where you can hear extreme detail,
but the dynamic doesn't change that much.
Okay, is this
a model for creation,
this adaptation that we do?
And does it happen anywhere else?
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,
birds do it too --
that the birds in the canopy,
where the foliage is dense,
their calls tend to be
high-pitched, short and repetitive.
And the birds on the floor
tend to have lower pitched calls,
so that they don't get distorted
when they bounce off the forest floor.
And birds like this Savannah sparrow,
they tend to have a buzzing
(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)
type call.
And it turns out that
a sound like this
is the most energy efficient and practical way
to transmit their call
across the fields and savannahs.
Other birds, like this tanager,
have adapted within the same species.
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,
where the forests are a little denser,
has one kind of call,
and the tananger on the other side, on the west
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
has a different kind of call.
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)
So birds do it too.
Well, if this is a model for creation,
if we make music,
primarily the form at least,
to fit these contexts,
and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,
and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,
is that how it works?
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.
It's adaptive.
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy
is still there.
This is a reverse view of things
from the kind of traditional Romantic view.
The Romantic view is that
first comes the passion
and then the outpouring of emotion,
and then somehow it gets shaped into something.
And I'm saying,
well, the passion's still there,
but the vessel
that it's going to be injected into and poured into,
that is instinctively and intuitively
created first.
We already know where that passion is going.
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.
Thomas Frank,
says that
this might be a kind of explanation
why some voters vote
against their best interests,
that voters, like a lot of us,
assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,
that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,
that it's more authentic.
And they'll vote for that.
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,
if they can fake passion,
they stand a better chance
of being selected in that way,
which seems a little dangerous.
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,
are not mutually exclusive.
that we are like the birds.
We adapt.
We sing.
And like the birds, the joy is still there,
even though we have changed what we do
to fit the context.
Those of you who may remember me from TEDGlobal
remember me asking a few questions
which still preoccupy me.
One of them was: Why is it necessary to spend
six billion pounds
speeding up the Eurostar train
when, for about 10 percent of that money,
you could have top supermodels, male and female,
serving free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers
for the entire duration of the journey?
You'd still have five billion left in change,
and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down.
Now, you may remember me asking the question as well,
a very interesting observation,
that actually those strange little signs
that actually flash "35" at you,
occasionally accompanying a little smiley face
or a frown,
according to whether you're within or outside the speed limit --
those are actually more effective
at preventing road accidents than speed cameras,
which come with the actual threat
of real punishment.
I think, in many areas of human problem solving,
particularly those which involve human psychology,
which is: The tendency
of the organization or the institution
is to deploy as much force as possible,
as much compulsion as possible,
whereas actually, the tendency of the person
is to be almost influenced
in absolute reverse proportion
to the amount of force being applied.
So there seems to be a complete disconnect here.
So what I'm asking for is the creation of a new job title --
I'll come to this a little later --
and perhaps the addition of a new word
into the English language.
Because it does seem to me that large organizations
including government, which is, of course, the largest organization of all,
have actually become
completely disconnected
with what actually matters to people.
You may remember this as the AOL-Time Warner merger, okay,
heralded at the time as the largest
single deal of all time.
It may still be, for all I know.
Now, all of you in this room, in one form or other,
are probably customers of one or both
of those organizations that merged.
Just interested, did anybody notice anything different
as a result of this at all?
So unless you happened to be a shareholder
of one or the other organizations
or one of the dealmakers or lawyers involved in the no-doubt lucrative activity,
you're actually engaging in a huge piece of activity
that meant absolutely bugger-all to anybody, okay?
By contrast, years of marketing have taught me
that if you actually want people to remember you
and to appreciate what you do,
the most potent things are actually very, very small.
This is from Virgin Atlantic upper-class,
it's the cruet salt and pepper set.
Quite nice in itself, they're little, sort of, airplane things.
What's really, really sweet is every single person looking at these things
has exactly the same mischievous thought,
which is, "I reckon I can heist these."
However, you pick them up and underneath,
actually engraved in the metal, are the words,
"Stolen from Virgin Atlantic Airways upper-class."
(Laughter)
Now, years after
you remember the strategic question
of whether you're flying in a 777 or an Airbus,
you remember those words and that experience.
Has anybody stayed there?
It's the lift, it's a series of buttons in the lift.
Nothing unusual about that at all,
except that these are actually not the buttons that take you to an individual floor.
It starts with garage at the bottom, I suppose, appropriately,
but it doesn't go up garage, grand floor, mezzanine, one, two, three, four.
It actually says garage, funk, rhythm and blues.
You have a series of buttons. You actually choose your lift music.
My guess is that the cost of installing this in the lift
in the Lydmar Hotel in Stockholm
is probably 500 to 1,000 pounds max.
It's frankly more memorable
than all those millions of hotels we've all stayed at
that tell you that your room has actually been recently renovated
at a cost of 500,000 dollars,
in order to make it resemble every other hotel room you've ever stayed in
in the entire course of your life.
But I was at a TED event recently and Esther Duflo,
probably one of the leading experts in,
effectively, the eradication of poverty in the developing world,
actually spoke.
And she came across a similar example
of something that fascinated me
as being something which, in a business context or a government context,
would simply be so trivial a solution
as to seem embarrassing.
It was simply to encourage the inoculation of children
by, not only making it a social event --
I think good use of behavioral economics in that,
if you turn up with several other mothers
to have your child inoculated,
your sense of confidence is much greater than if you turn up alone.
But secondly, to incentivize that inoculation
by giving a kilo of lentils to everybody who participated.
It's a tiny, tiny thing.
If you're a senior person at UNESCO
and someone says, "So what are you doing
to eradicate world poverty?"
you're not really confident standing up there
saying, "I've got it cracked; it's the lentils," are you?
feels that big important problems
need to have big important, and most of all, expensive
solutions attached to them.
And yet, what behavioral economics shows time after time after time
is in human behavioral and behavioral change
there's a very, very strong disproportionality at work,
that actually what changes our behavior
and what changes our attitude to things
is not actually proportionate to the degree
of expense entailed,
or the degree of force that's applied.
But everything about institutions
makes them uncomfortable
with that disproportionality.
So what happens in an institution
is the very person who has the power to solve the problem
also has a very, very large budget.
And once you have a very, very large budget,
you actually look for expensive things to spend it on.
What is completely lacking is a class of people
who have immense amounts of power, but no money at all.
(Laughter)
It's those people I'd quite like to create
in the world going forward.
which is what I call sometimes "Terminal 5 syndrome,"
which is that big, expensive things
get big, highly-intelligent attention,
and they're great, and Terminal 5 is absolutely magnificent,
until you get down to the small detail, the usability,
which is the signage,
which is catastrophic.
You come out of "Arrive" at the airport, and you follow
a big yellow sign that says "Trains" and it's in front of you.
So you walk for another hundred yards,
expecting perhaps another sign,
that might courteously be yellow, in front of you and saying "Trains."
No, no, no, the next one is actually blue, to your left,
and says "Heathrow Express."
I mean, it could almost be rather like that scene from the film "Airplane."
A yellow sign? That's exactly what they'll be expecting.
now, all credit to the British Airport Authority.
I spoke about this before,
and a brilliant person got in touch with me and said, "Okay, what can you do?"
So I did come up with five suggestions, which they are actually actioning.
One of them also being,
although logically it's quite a good idea
to have a lift with no up and down button in it,
if it only serves two floors,
it's actually bloody terrifying, okay?
Because when the door closes
and there's nothing for you to do,
you've actually just stepped into a Hammer film.
is the big stuff, actually,
is done magnificently well.
But the small stuff, what you might call the user interface,
is done spectacularly badly.
But also, there seems to be a complete sort of gridlock
in terms of solving these small solutions.
Because the people who can actually solve them
actually are too powerful and too preoccupied
with something they think of as "strategy" to actually solve them.
I tried this exercise recently, talking about banking.
They said, "Can we do an advertising campaign?
What can we do and encourage more online banking?"
I said, "It's really, really easy."
I said, "When people login to their online bank
there are lots and lots of things they'd probably quite like to look at.
The last thing in the world you ever want to see is your balance."
I've got friends who actually
never use their own bank cash machines
because there's the risk that it might display
their balance on the screen.
Okay, you simply wouldn't.
I said, "If you make, actually, 'Tell me my balance.'
If you make that an option rather than the default,
you'll find twice as many people log on to online banking,
and they do it three times as often."
Let's face it, most of us -- how many of you
actually check your balance before you remove cash from a cash machine?
And you're pretty rich by the standards of the world at large.
Now, interesting that no single person does that,
or at least can admit to being so anal as to do it.
But what's interesting about that suggestion
was that, to implement that suggestion wouldn't cost 10 million pounds;
it wouldn't involve large amounts of expenditure;
it would actually cost about 50 quid.
And yet, it never happens.
that actually, the people with the power
want to do big expensive things.
And there's to some extent a big strategy myth
that's prevalent in business now.
And if you think about it, it's very, very important
that the strategy myth is maintained.
Because, if the board of directors convince everybody
that the success of any organization
is almost entirely dependent on the decisions made by the board of directors,
it makes the disparity in salaries
slightly more justifiable
than if you actually acknowledge that quite a lot of the credit for a company's success
might actually lie somewhere else,
in small pieces of tactical activity.
and the invention of the spreadsheet hasn't helped this;
lots of things haven't helped this --
business and government suffers from a kind of physics envy.
It wants the world to be the kind of place where
the input and the change are proportionate.
It's a kind of mechanistic world
that we'd all love to live in
where, effectively, it sits very nicely on spreadsheets,
everything is numerically expressible,
and the amount you spend on something is proportionate
to the scale of your success.
That's the world people actually want.
In truth, we do live in a world that science can understand.
Unfortunately, the science is probably closer to being climatology
in that in many cases,
very, very small changes
can have disproportionately huge effects,
and equally, vast areas of activity, enormous mergers,
can actually accomplish absolutely bugger-all.
But it's very, very uncomfortable for us
to actually acknowledge that we're living in such a world.
a little bit better for ourselves
if we looked at it in this very simple four-way approach.
That is actually strategy, and I'm not denying that strategy has a role.
You know, there are cases where you spend quite a lot of money
and you accomplish quite a lot.
And I'd be wrong to dis that completely.
Moving over, we come, of course, to consultancy.
to ditch Tiger Woods in such
a sort of hurried and hasty way.
I mean, Tiger surely was actually obeying the Accenture model.
He developed an interesting outsourcing model for sexual services,
(Laughter)
no longer tied to a single monopoly provider,
in many cases, sourcing things locally,
and of course, the ability to have between one and three girls delivered at any time
led for better load-balancing.
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that, I'm not sure.
That's called trivia.
But there's a fourth thing.
And the fundamental problem is we don't actually have a word for this stuff.
We don't know what to call it.
And actually we don't spend nearly enough money
looking for those things,
looking for those tiny things that may or may not work,
but which, if they do work,
can have a success absolutely out of proportion
to their expense, their efforts
and the disruption they cause.
is a competition -- to anybody watching this as a film --
is to come up with a name for that stuff on the bottom right.
And the second thing, I think,
is that the world needs to have people in charge of that.
That's why I call for the "Chief Detail Officer."
Every corporation should have one,
and every government should have a Ministry of Detail.
The people who actually have no money,
who have no extravagant budget,
but who realize that actually
you might achieve greater success in uptake
of a government program
by actually doubling the level of benefits you pay,
but you'll probably achieve exactly that same effect
simply by redesigning the form
and writing it in comprehensible English.
And if actually we created a Ministry of Detail
and business actually had Chief Detail Officers,
then that fourth quadrant,
which is so woefully neglected at the moment,
might finally get the attention it deserves.
One thing the world needs,
one thing this country desperately needs
is a better way
of conducting our political debates.
We need to rediscover
the lost art of democratic argument.
(Applause)
If you think about the arguments we have,
most of the time it's shouting matches
on cable television,
ideological food fights on the floor of Congress.
I have a suggestion.
Look at all the arguments we have these days
over health care,
over bonuses and bailouts on Wall Street,
over the gap between rich and poor,
over affirmative action and same-sex marriage.
Lying just beneath the surface
of those arguments,
with passions raging on all sides,
are big questions
of moral philosophy,
big questions of justice.
But we too rarely
articulate and defend
and argue about
those big moral questions in our politics.
is have something of a discussion.
First, let me take
a famous philosopher
who wrote about those questions
of justice and morality,
give you a very short lecture
on Aristotle of ancient Athens,
Aristotle's theory of justice,
and then have a discussion here
to see whether Aristotle's ideas
actually inform
the way we think and argue
about questions today.
So, are you ready for the lecture?
According to Aristotle,
justice means giving people what they deserve.
That's it; that's the lecture.
The real questions begin
when it comes to arguing about
who deserves what and why.
Take the example of flutes.
Suppose we're distributing flutes.
Who should get the best ones?
Let's see what people --
What would you say?
Who should get the best flute?
You can just call it out.
Or by the first person to rush into the hall to get them.
Who else?
How many say the best flute players?
Why?
Actually, that was Aristotle's answer too.
Why do you think,
those of you who voted this way,
that the best flutes should go to the best flute players?
We'll hear better music
if the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
That's Peter? (Audience: Peter.)
Well, it's a good reason.
We'll all be better off if good music is played
rather than terrible music.
But Peter,
Aristotle doesn't agree with you that that's the reason.
That's all right.
Aristotle had a different reason
for saying the best flutes should go to the best flute players.
He said,
that's what flutes are for --
to be played well.
He says that to reason about
just distribution of a thing,
we have to reason about,
and sometimes argue about,
the purpose of the thing,
or the social activity --
in this case, musical performance.
And the point, the essential nature,
of musical performance
is to produce excellent music.
It'll be a happy byproduct
that we'll all benefit.
But when we think about justice,
Aristotle says,
what we really need to think about
is the essential nature of the activity in question
and the qualities that are worth
honoring and admiring and recognizing.
One of the reasons
that the best flute players should get the best flutes
is that musical performance
is not only to make the rest of us happy,
but to honor
and recognize
the excellence
of the best musicians.
may seem a trivial case.
Let's take a contemporary example
of the dispute about justice.
It had to do with golf.
Casey Martin -- a few years ago,
Casey Martin --
did any of you hear about him?
He was a very good golfer,
but he had a disability.
He had a bad leg, a circulatory problem,
that made it very painful
for him to walk the course.
In fact, it carried risk of injury.
He asked the PGA,
the Professional Golfers' Association,
for permission to use a golf cart
in the PGA tournaments.
They said, "No.
Now that would give you an unfair advantage."
He sued,
and his case went all the way
to the Supreme Court, believe it or not,
the case over the golf cart,
because the law says
that the disabled
must be accommodated,
provided the accommodation does not
change the essential nature
of the activity.
He says, "I'm a great golfer.
I want to compete.
But I need a golf cart
to get from one hole to the next."
on the Supreme Court.
Suppose you were deciding
the justice of this case.
How many here would say
that Casey Martin does have a right to use a golf cart?
And how many say, no, he doesn't?
All right, let's take a poll, show of hands.
How many would rule in favor of Casey Martin?
And how many would not? How many would say he doesn't?
All right, we have a good division of opinion here.
Someone who would not
grant Casey Martin the right to a golf cart,
what would be your reason?
Raise your hand, and we'll try to get you a microphone.
What would be your reason?
if he gets to ride in a golf cart.
All right, those of you,
I imagine most of you who would not give him the golf cart
worry about an unfair advantage.
What about those of you who say
he should be given a golf cart?
How would you answer the objection?
Yes, all right.
We'll get Charlie a microphone in case someone wants to reply.
Tell us, Charlie,
why would you say he should be able to use a golf cart?
All right, who has an answer for Charlie?
What would you say?
walking all those holes.
That's part of the game of golf? (Audience: Absolutely.)
Charlie, what do you say to Warren?
(Laughter)
it's interesting.
In the case, in the lower court,
they brought in golfing greats
to testify on this very issue.
Is walking the course essential to the game?
And they brought in Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer.
And what do you suppose they all said?
Yes. They agreed with Warren.
They said, yes, walking the course
is strenuous physical exercise.
The fatigue factor is an important part of golf.
And so it would change
the fundamental nature of the game
to give him the golf cart.
Now, notice,
something interesting --
Well, I should tell you about the Supreme Court first.
decided.
What do you suppose they said?
They said yes,
that Casey Martin must be provided a golf cart.
Seven to two, they ruled.
What was interesting about their ruling
and about the discussion we've just had
is that the discussion about
the right, the justice, of the matter
depended on
figuring out what is
the essential nature of golf.
And the Supreme Court justices
wrestled with that question.
And Justice Stevens, writing for the majority,
said he had read all about the history of golf,
and the essential point of the game
is to get very small ball from one place
into a hole
in as few strokes as possible,
and that walking was not essential, but incidental.
one of whom was Justice Scalia.
He wouldn't have granted the cart,
and he had a very interesting dissent.
It's interesting because
he rejected the Aristotelian premise
underlying the majority's opinion.
He said it's not possible
to determine the essential nature
of a game like golf.
Here's how he put it.
"To say that something is essential
is ordinarily to say that it is necessary
to the achievement of a certain object.
But since it is the very nature of a game
to have no object except amusement,
(Laughter)
that is, what distinguishes games
from productive activity,
(Laughter)
it is quite impossible to say
that any of a game's arbitrary rules
is essential."
taking on the Aristotelian premise
of the majority's opinion.
Justice Scalia's opinion
is questionable
for two reasons.
First, no real sports fan would talk that way.
(Laughter)
If we had thought that the rules
of the sports we care about
are merely arbitrary,
rather than designed to call forth
the virtues and the excellences
that we think are worthy of admiring,
we wouldn't care about the outcome of the game.
It's also objectionable
on a second ground.
On the face of it,
it seemed to be -- this debate about the golf cart --
an argument about fairness,
what's an unfair advantage.
But if fairness were the only thing at stake,
there would have been an easy and obvious solution.
What would it be? (Audience: Let everyone use the cart.)
Let everyone ride in a golf cart
if they want to.
Then the fairness objection goes away.
would have been, I suspect,
more anathema
to the golfing greats
and to the PGA,
even than making an exception for Casey Martin.
Why?
Because what was at stake
in the dispute over the golf cart
was not only the essential nature of golf,
but, relatedly, the question:
What abilities
are worthy
of honor and recognition
as athletic talents?
Let me put the point
as delicately as possible:
Golfers are a little sensitive
about the athletic status of their game.
(Laughter)
After all, there's no running or jumping,
and the ball stands still.
(Laughter)
So if golfing is the kind of game
that can be played while riding around in a golf cart,
it would be hard to confer
on the golfing greats
the status that we confer,
the honor and recognition
that goes to truly great athletes.
That illustrates
that with golf,
as with flutes,
it's hard to decide the question
of what justice requires,
without grappling with the question,
"What is the essential nature
of the activity in question,
and what qualities,
what excellences
connected with that activity,
are worthy of honor and recognition?"
that's prominent in contemporary political debate:
same-sex marriage.
There are those who favor state recognition
only of traditional marriage
between one man and one woman,
and there are those who favor state recognition
of same-sex marriage.
How many here
favor the first policy:
the state should recognize traditional marriage only?
And how many favor the second, same-sex marriage?
Now, put it this way:
What ways of thinking
about justice and morality
underlie the arguments we have
over marriage?
The opponents of same-sex marriage say
that the purpose of marriage,
fundamentally, is procreation,
and that's what's worthy of honoring
and recognizing and encouraging.
And the defenders of same-sex marriage say no,
procreation is not the only purpose of marriage;
what about a lifelong, mutual, loving commitment?
That's really what marriage is about.
So with flutes, with golf carts,
and even with a fiercely contested question
like same-sex marriage,
Aristotle has a point.
Very hard to argue about justice
without first arguing
about the purpose of social institutions
and about what qualities are worthy
of honor and recognition.
and see how they shed light
on the way we might improve, elevate,
the terms of political discourse
in the United States,
and for that matter, around the world.
There is a tendency to think
that if we engage too directly
with moral questions in politics,
that's a recipe for disagreement,
and for that matter, a recipe for
intolerance and coercion.
So better to shy away from,
to ignore,
the moral and the religious convictions
that people bring to civic life.
It seems to me that our discussion
reflects the opposite,
that a better way
to mutual respect
is to engage directly
with the moral convictions
citizens bring to public life,
rather than to require
that people leave their deepest moral convictions
outside politics
before they enter.
That, it seems to me, is a way
to begin to restore
the art of democratic argument.
Thanks. Thank you.
Chris.
Thanks, Chris.
to same-sex marriage --
that was a genius link.
Now look, you're a pioneer of open education.
Your lecture series was one of the first to do it big.
What's your vision for the next phase of this?
In the classroom, we have arguments
on some of the most fiercely held
moral convictions that students have
about big public questions.
And I think we can do that in public life more generally.
And so my real dream would be
to take the public television series
that we've created of the course --
it's available now, online,
free for everyone anywhere in the world --
and to see whether we can partner with institutions,
at universities in China, in India,
in Africa, around the world,
to try to promote
civic education
and also a richer kind
of democratic debate.
live, in real time,
you could have this kind of conversation, inviting questions,
but with people from China and India joining in?
with 1,500 people in Long Beach,
and we do it in a classroom at Harvard
with about 1,000 students.
Wouldn't it be interesting
to take this way
of thinking and arguing,
engaging seriously with big moral questions,
exploring cultural differences
and connect through a live video hookup,
students in Beijing and Mumbai
and in Cambridge, Massachusetts
and create a global classroom.
That's what I would love to do.
that there are a lot of people who would love to join you in that endeavor.
Michael Sandel. Thank you so much. (MS: Thanks so much.)
Hi there.
I'm going to be talking a little bit about
music, machines and life.
Or, more specifically,
what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine
for a music video.
Some of you may recognize this image.
This is the opening frame of the video that we created.
We'll be showing the video at the end,
but before we do, I want to talk a little bit about
what it is that they wanted.
the name of the song is "This Too Shall Pass" --
we were really excited because
they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with.
And we were very excited about this
because, of course,
they have a history of dancing with machines.
They're responsible for this video, "Here It Goes Again."
50-million-plus views on YouTube.
Four guys dancing on treadmills,
no cuts, just a static camera.
A fantastically viral and wonderful video.
So we were really excited about working with them.
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted.
And they explained that they wanted
kind of a Rube Goldberg machine.
a Rube Goldberg machine
is a complicated contraption,
an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery
that accomplishes a relatively simple task.
So we were excited by this idea,
and we started talking about
exactly what it would look like.
And we came up with some parameters, because,
you know, building a Rube Goldberg machine
has limitations,
but it also is pretty wide open.
that would work for a music video.
So we came up with a list of requirements,
the "10 commandments,"
and they were, in order of ascending difficulty:
The first is "No magic."
Everything that happened on screen had to be
very easily understood by a typical viewer.
The rule of thumb was that, if my mother couldn't understand it,
then we couldn't use it in the video.
They wanted band integration,
that is, the machine acting upon the band members,
specifically not the other way around.
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling.
So as the song picks up emotion,
so should the machine
get grander in its process.
They wanted us to make use of the space.
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using,
divided between two floors.
It included an exterior loading dock.
We used all of that, including a giant hole in the floor
that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through.
They wanted it messy, and we were happy to oblige.
The machine itself would start the music.
So the machine would get started,
it would travel some distance,
reacting along the way,
hit play on an iPod or a tape deck
or something that would start playback.
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout.
And speaking of synchronization,
they wanted it to sync to the rhythm
and to hit specific beats along the way.
Okay. (Laughter)
They wanted it to end precisely on time.
Okay, so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect.
And they wanted the music to drop out
at a certain point in the video
and actual live audio from the machine
to play part of the song.
And as if that wasn't enough,
all of these incredibly complicating things, right,
they wanted it in one shot.
So, just some statistics
about what we went through in the process.
The machine itself has
89 distinct interactions.
It took us 85 takes
to get it on film
to our satisfaction.
Of those 85 takes,
only three actually successfully completed their run.
We destroyed two pianos
and 10 televisions in the process.
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times.
(Laughter)
And we lost one high-heeled shoe
when one of our engineers, Heather Knight,
left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner,
and returned back to the build --
and left it in a pile of stuff.
And another engineer thought, "Well, that would be a really good thing to use"
and ended up using it as a really nice trigger.
And it's actually in the machine.
Well, having completed this,
we have the opportunity to step back and reflect
on some of the things.
And we learned that small stuff stinks.
Little balls in wooden tracks
are really susceptible to
humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust,
and they fall out of the tracks,
the exact angles makes it hard to get right.
And yet, a bowling ball will always follow the same path.
It doesn't matter what temperature it is,
doesn't matter what's in its way;
it will pretty much get where it needs to go.
But as much as the small stuff stinks, we needed somewhere to start,
so that we would have somewhere to go.
And so you have to start with it. You have to focus on it.
Small stuff stinks,
but, of course, it's essential, right?
(Laughter)
You know, we spent a lot of time ideating
and even building some of these things.
It's been said that, "No battle plan
survives contact with the enemy."
I think our enemy was physics --
(Laughter)
and she's a cruel mistress.
Often, we had to pull things out as a result
because of timing or aesthetics or whatever.
And so while planning is important, so is flexibility.
These are all things that ended up
not making it into the final machine.
So also, put reliable stuff last,
the stuff that's going to run every time.
Again, small to large is relevant here.
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video
references the big, real car
near the end of the video.
The big, real car works every time; there's no problem about it.
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track
and that's a problem.
But you don't want to have to reset the whole machine
because the Lego car at the end doesn't work, right.
So you put that up front so that, if it fails,
at least you know
you don't have to reset the whole thing.
messy.
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing.
Months were spent in this tiny, cold warehouse.
And the wonderful elation that we had
when we finally completed it.
So it's important to remember that whether it's good or it's bad,
"This Too Shall Pass."
And now to introduce
we have OK Go.
We are OK Go.
What are we doing? Oh, just hanging out with our Grammy. What what!
It think we can do better than this. Hello TEDxUSC.
We are OK Go. Have you read the "Natural Curiosity Cabinet?"
I mean, "Curiosity" -- excuse me.
Let me start again.
We need some more ridiculous things besides "The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities."
Tim's sundial hat.
Have you seen the new work they've done to the Waltz Towers?
Sorry, start again.
(Barking)
Dogs.
Hello, TEDxUSC. We are OK Go,
and this our new video, "This Too Shall Pass."
[unclear]
Kay, we can still do one better I think, yeah.
That one's pretty good. It's getting better.
We live in difficult and challenging
economic times, of course.
And one of the first victims
of difficult economic times,
I think, is public spending of any kind,
but certainly in the firing line at the moment
is public spending for science,
and particularly curiosity-led science
and exploration.
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes
that that's a ridiculous
and ludicrous thing to do.
I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt
to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,
but it is a bit of a mess.
(Laughter)
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration
of how much science costs.
Because, if I'm going to make the case
for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,
I should tell you how much it costs.
So this is a game called "spot the science budgets."
This is the U.K. government spend.
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.
if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs
and then yellow set of blobs.
And it's one of the yellow set of blobs
around the big yellow blob.
It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year
out of 620 billion.
That funds everything in the U.K.
from medical research, space exploration,
where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,
engineering, even arts and humanities,
funded from the science budget,
which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob
around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.
So that's what we're arguing about.
That percentage, by the way, is about the same
in the U.S. and Germany and France.
R&D in total in the economy,
publicly funded, is about
0.6 percent of GDP.
So that's what we're arguing about.
and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"
is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe
has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.
This is a picture that actually was sent back
by the Cassini space probe around Saturn,
after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."
So it isn't in the series.
It's of the moon Enceladus.
So that big sweeping, white
sphere in the corner is Saturn,
which is actually in the background of the picture.
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,
which is about as big as the British Isles.
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.
So, tiny moon.
What's fascinating and beautiful ...
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,
it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.
some faint, sort of,
wisps of almost smoke
rising up from the limb.
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."
It's a beautiful graphic.
What we found out were that those faint wisps
are actually fountains of ice
rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself,
but we think that the mechanism
for powering those fountains
requires there to be lakes of liquid water
beneath the surface of this moon.
And what's important about that
is that, on our planet, on Earth,
wherever we find liquid water,
we find life.
So, to find strong evidence
of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon
750 million miles away from the Earth
is really quite astounding.
So what we're saying, essentially,
is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.
That's one more picture of Enceladus.
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.
So it made a very low pass,
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,
absolutely beautiful.
That's probably this place,
which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.
And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system
to get any sense that this moon, as most moons,
was anything other than a dead ball of rock.
It's actually an ice moon.
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,
which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.
But by measuring the way that
Europa interacts
with the magnetic field of Jupiter,
and looking at how those cracks in the ice
that you can see there on that graphic move around,
we've inferred very strongly
that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding
the entire surface of Europa.
So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that
there's more water on that moon of Jupiter
than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter,
is probably the prime candidate
for finding life on a moon
or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.
has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.
It may also have pointed the way to answering
one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,
which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"
Is there any other use to exploration and science,
other than just a sense of wonder?
Well, there is.
This is a very famous picture
taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,
December 24th, 1968,
when I was about eight months old.
It was taken by Apollo 8
as it went around the back of the moon.
Earthrise from Apollo 8.
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture
that saved 1968,
which was a turbulent year --
the student riots in Paris,
the height of the Vietnam War.
The reason many people think that about this picture,
and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,
is that this picture, arguably, was
the beginning of the environmental movement.
Because, for the first time,
we saw our world,
not as a solid, immovable,
kind of indestructible place,
but as a very small, fragile-looking world
just hanging against the blackness of space.
about the space exploration, about the Apollo program,
is the economic contribution it made.
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful
and a tremendous achievement
and delivered pictures like this,
it cost a lot, didn't it?
Well, actually, many studies have been done
about the economic effectiveness,
the economic impact of Apollo.
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.
And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,
14 came back into the U.S. economy.
So the Apollo program paid for itself
in inspiration,
in engineering, achievement
and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers
14 times over.
So exploration can pay for itself.
What about driving innovation?
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.
What it is, is a picture of the spectrum
of hydrogen.
See, back in the 1880s, 1890s,
many scientists, many observers,
looked at the light given off from atoms.
And they saw strange pictures like this.
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism
is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow
like a white light,
it just emits light at particular colors,
a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure
because the way that's explained
is atoms are a single nucleus
with electrons going around them.
And the electrons can only be in particular places.
And when they jump up to the next place they can be,
and fall back down again,
they emit light at particular colors.
only emit light at very specific colors,
was one of the key drivers
that led to the development of the quantum theory,
the theory of the structure of atoms.
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere
absorbing light.
And again, they only absorb light at particular colors
when electrons jump up and fall down,
jump up and fall down.
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.
And the element helium
was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun
because some of those black lines were found
that corresponded to no known element.
And that's why helium's called helium.
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.
and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,
but the quantum theory quickly led
to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials
like silicon, for example.
The way that silicon behaves,
the fact that you can build transistors,
is a purely quantum phenomenon.
So without that curiosity-driven
understanding of the structure of atoms,
which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,
then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,
we wouldn't have pretty much the basis
of our modern economy.
In "Wonders of the Solar System,"
we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics
and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,
is you can transport it, not only to the planets,
but to the most distant stars and galaxies.
And one of the astonishing predictions
of quantum mechanics,
just by looking at the structure of atoms --
the same theory that describes transistors --
is that there can be no stars in the universe
that have reached the end of their life
that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,
get a telescope, swing it to the sky,
and you find that there are no dead stars
bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.
That's quite an incredible prediction.
Well, this is a picture of it.
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy
with, what, 100 billion
stars like our Sun in it.
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.
There are a billion stars in the galactic core,
which is why it's shining out so brightly.
This is about 50 million light years away,
so one of our neighboring galaxies.
But that bright star there
is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.
So that star is also
50 million light years away.
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly
as the center of the galaxy
with a billion suns in it.
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.
Now that's an incredible phenomena,
because it's a star that sits there.
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.
And it has a binary companion that goes around it,
so a big star, a big ball of gas.
And what it does is it sucks gas
off its companion star,
until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,
and then it explodes.
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly
as a billion suns for about two weeks,
and releases, not only energy,
but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.
in the universe at the Big Bang.
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe
throughout the first generation of stars.
It was made in stars like that,
locked away and then returned to the universe
in explosions like that
in order to recondense into planets,
stars, new solar systems
and, indeed, people like us.
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power
and beauty and universality of the laws of physics,
because we understand that process,
because we understand
the structure of atoms here on Earth.
we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming:
"When I woke up just after dawn
on September 28, 1928,
I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine
by discovering the world's first antibiotic."
Now, the explorers of the world of the atom
did not intend to invent the transistor.
And they certainly didn't intend to
describe the mechanics of supernova explosions,
which eventually told us where
the building blocks of life
were synthesized in the universe.
So, I think science can be --
serendipity is important.
It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.
It can also, I think, finally
reveal the most profound
ideas to us
about our place in the universe
and really the value of our home planet.
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.
But it's a famous picture, not because of
the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,
but actually because of a tiny, faint blob
just hanging underneath one of the rings.
And if I blow it up there, you see it.
It looks like a moon,
but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.
I think the Earth has got a strange property
that the farther away you get from it,
the more beautiful it seems.
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.
The Voyager is a tiny machine.
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,
transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,
and we're still in contact with it.
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus and Neptune.
And after it visited all four of those planets,
Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,
had the wonderful idea
of turning Voyager around
and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.
And it took this picture of Earth.
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,
but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.
That's Earth from four billion miles away.
Sagan wrote about it, just to finish,
because I cannot say words as beautiful as this
to describe what he saw
in that picture that he had taken.
He said, "Consider again that dot.
That's here. That's home. That's us.
On it, everyone you love,
everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,
every human being who ever was
lived out their lives.
The aggregates of joy and suffering
thousands of confident religions,
ideologies and economic doctrines,
every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,
every creator and destroyer of civilization,
every king and peasant, every young couple in love,
every mother and father, hopeful child,
inventor and explorer,
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,
every superstar, every supreme leader,
every saint and sinner in the history of our species,
lived there, on a mote of dust,
suspended in a sunbeam.
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling
and character-building experience.
There is perhaps no better demonstration
of the folly of human conceits
than this distant image of our tiny world.
To me, it underscores our responsibility
to deal more kindly with one another
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,
the only home we've ever known."
the power of science and exploration.
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made,
that we know enough about the universe.
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.
Surely, we know enough.
We don't need to discover anything else about our universe.
who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,
Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.
He was clearly under assault all the time.
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.
Just exploit it; just build things."
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal
to the progress of the human mind
than to presume that our views of science
are ultimate,
that our triumphs are complete,
that there are no mysteries in nature,
and that there are no new worlds to conquer."
Tom Green: That's a 4chan thing.
These kids on the Internet, they have this group of kids
and they like to say funny words
like "barrel roll."
It's a video game move from "Star Fox."
"Star Fox 20"? (Assistant: "Star Fox 64.")
Tom Green: Yeah. And they've been dogging me for a year.
I got to tell you, it's driving me nuts, actually.
Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night and I scream,
"4chan!"
I found this website called Futaba Channel.
And it was a Japanese forum and imageboard.
That format of forum, at that time,
was not well-known outside of Japan.
And so what I did is I took it, I translated it into English,
and I stuck it up for my friends to use.
Now, six and a half years later,
over seven million people are using it,
contributing over 700,000 posts per day.
And we've gone from one board
to 48 boards.
So, what's unique about the site
is that it's anonymous,
and it has no memory.
There's no archive, there are no barriers, there's no registration.
These things that we're used to with forums
don't exist on 4chan.
And that's led to this
discussion that's completely raw, completely unfiltered.
What the site's known for,
because it has this environment,
is it's fostered the creation of a lot of
Internet phenomena, viral videos and whatnot, known as "memes."
some of you might be familiar with are these LOLcats --
just silly pictures of cats with text.
And this resonates with millions of people, apparently,
because there are tens of thousands of these,
and there is a whole blogging empire now
dedicated to pictures like these.
And Rick Astley's kind of rebirth
these past two years ...
Rickroll was this bait and switch,
really simple, classic bait and switch.
Somebody says they're linking to something interesting,
and you get an '80s pop song. That's all it was.
And it got big enough to the point where
there was a float last year at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade,
and Rick Astley pops out, and rickrolls
millions of people on television.
(Laughter)
There are a handful that have escaped into the mainstream,
the ones I've just shown you,
but every day, every month,
people are producing thousands of these.
We do; they're the codified rules that I've come up with,
which are more-or-less ignored by the community.
And so they've come up with their own set of rules,
the "Rules of the Internet."
And so there are three that I want to show you specifically.
Rule one is you don't talk about /b/.
Two is you do not talk about /b/.
And this one's kind of interesting:
"If it exists, there is porn of it. No exceptions."
(Laughter)
And I will spare you that slide.
I assure you, it is very true.
and it is, in many ways,
the beating heart of the website.
It is where a third of all the traffic is going.
And /b/ is known for,
more than anything,
not just the memes they've created, but the exploits.
And Chris just touched on one of those a second ago,
and that was the Time 100 poll.
So somebody at Time, at the magazine,
thought it would be fun to nominate me
for this thing they did last year.
And so they placed me on it,
and the Internet got wind of it. My community
decided they wanted me to win it.
I didn't instruct them to do it; they just decided that that's what they wanted.
And so, you know, 390 percent approval rating ain't so bad.
(Laughter)
So they broke that poll.
And I ended up on top.
I ended up at this really fancy party.
It's that they weren't putting me at the top of this list;
they were actually --
it got so sophisticated to the point where they gamed
all of the top 21 places
to spell "mARBLECAKE. ALSO, THE GAME."
(Laughter)
The amount of time and effort that went into that
is absolutely incredible.
And "marble cake" is significant because
it is the channel that this group called Anonymous organized.
Anonymous is this group of people
that protested, very famously,
Scientology.
The story is,
Scientology had this embarrassing video of Tom Cruise. It went up online.
They got it taken offline and managed to piss off part of the Internet.
And so these people, over 7,000 people,
less than one month later,
organized in a hundred cities around the globe and --
this is L.A. --
protested the Church of Scientology,
and they have continued to do so,
now, two full years after the fact.
They are still protesting.
(Laughter)
So we've got this activist group that's this grassroots group
that's come out of the site.
the story of Dusty the cat.
Dusty is the name that we've given to this cat.
This young man
posted a video
of him abusing his cat on YouTube.
And, you know, this didn't sit well with people,
and so there was this outpouring of support
for people to do something about this.
So what they did is they -- I mean, they put CSI to shame here --
the Internet detectives came out.
They matched, they found his MySpace.
They took the YouTube video and they mashed everything in the video.
Within 24 hours,
they had his name,
and within 48 hours, he was arrested.
about a community like 4chan
is just that it's this open place.
As I said, it's raw, it's unfiltered.
And sites like it are kind of
going the way of the dinosaur right now.
They're endangered because we're moving
towards social networking.
We're moving towards persistent identity.
We're moving towards,
you know, a lack of privacy, really.
We're sacrificing a lot of that, and I think in doing so,
moving towards those things, we're losing something valuable.
Got a couple questions for you.
But if I ask them, is the TED website going to go down?
being streamed to them live right now.
we've got people in 75 countries out there watching.
Don't tell.
But seriously,
this issue on anonymity is --
I mean, you made the case there.
But anonymity basically allows people to say anything,
all the rules gone.
You've had to wrestle with issues like child pornography.
And I'm just curious whether you
sometimes lie awake in the night
worrying that you've opened Pandora's box.
I mean, for as much good
that kind of comes out of this environment,
there is plenty of bad.
There are plenty of downsides.
But I think that the greater good
is being served here by just allowing people --
there are very few places, now, where you can go
and not have identity, to be completely anonymous
and say whatever you'd like.
And saying whatever you like, I think, is powerful.
Doing whatever you like is now crossing a line.
But I think it's important to have these places.
When I get emails, people say, "Thank you for giving me this place,
this outlet, where I can come after work
and be myself."
you know, can be constructive; it can be really damaging.
And if you cut the link between what is said
and any attribution back to you,
I mean, surely there are huge risks with that.
But --
what you might say at TED, right?
on Sunday.
And within 24 hours,
it had over 12,000 responses.
And the thing is,
I didn't make it into that presentation
because I can't read to you anything that they said, more or less.
(Laughter)
99 percent of it is just,
would have been, you know, bleeped out.
But there were some good things that came out of that too.
(Laughter)
Love and peace were mentioned.
kind of with quote marks around them, right?
CA: And that content is all off the board now.
Right, it's gone? Or is it still up there?
It went up to about 16,000 posts,
and now it has been taken off.
Now, I'm not sure I would have necessarily recommended
everyone at TED to go and check it out anyway.
Chris, you yourself? I mean, you're a figure of some intrigue.
You've got this surprising
semi-underground influence,
but it's not making you a lot of money, yet.
What's the commercial picture here?
much of one, I guess.
The site has adult content on it.
I mean, obviously, it's got some very offensive, obscene content on it,
just in terms of language alone.
And when you've got that, you've pretty much sacrificed
any hope of making lots of money.
have with your mother about 4chan?
awkward conversations.
The content is not dinner table conversation in the least.
But my parents -- I think part of why
they kind of are able to appreciate it
is because they don't understand it.
(Laughter)
CA: And they were probably pleased to see you
on top of the Time poll.
what do you picture yourself doing?
As I said, I just went back to school,
and I am considering
majoring in urban studies
and then going on to urban planning,
kind of taking whatever I've learned from online communities
and trying to adapt that
to a physical community.
I would like to share with you this morning
some stories about the ocean
through my work as a still photographer
for National Geographic magazine.
I guess I became an underwater photographer
and a photojournalist
because I fell in love with the sea as a child.
And I wanted to tell stories
about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater,
incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors.
And after even 30 years of doing this,
after 30 years of exploring the ocean,
I never cease to be amazed
at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I'm at sea.
But more and more frequently these days
I'm seeing terrible things underwater as well,
things that I don't think most people realize.
And I've been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues
to tell a more complete story.
I want people to see what's happening underwater,
both the horror and the magic.
where I recognized the ability to include
environmental issues within a natural history coverage,
was a story I proposed on harp seals.
The story I wanted to do initially
was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year
where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic
to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada
to engage in courtship, mating and to have their pups.
And all of this is played out against
the backdrop of transient pack ice
that moves with wind and tide.
And because I'm an underwater photographer,
I wanted to do this story from both above and below,
to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups
making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water.
But as I got more involved in the story,
I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn't ignore.
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted,
killed with hakapiks at about eight, 15 days old.
It actually is the largest marine mammal
slaughter on the planet,
with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year.
I think the bigger problem for harp seals
is the loss of sea ice due to global warming.
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows
the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season.
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture,
there's a lot of water as well, which wasn't there historically.
And the ice that is there is quite thin.
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice
in order to nurse from their moms.
They only need 12 days from the moment they're born until they're on their own.
But if they don't get 12 days,
they can fall into the ocean and die.
This is a photo that I made showing
one of these pups that's only about five or seven days old --
still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly --
that has fallen in because of the thin ice,
and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe
and to get it back to stable purchase.
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there.
I read that last year the pup mortality rate
was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
So, clearly, this species has a lot of problems going forward.
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic.
And it received quite a bit of attention.
doing other stories about ocean problems.
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis,
in part because I had personally witnessed
a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years,
but also because I read a scientific paper
that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean
have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years.
These are the tuna, the billfish and the sharks.
When I read that, I was blown away by those numbers.
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet,
but it really wasn't, so I wanted to do a story
that was a very different kind of underwater story.
I wanted it to be more like war photography,
where I was making harder-hitting pictures
that showed readers what was happening
to marine wildlife around the planet.
was to give readers a sense of appreciation
for the ocean animals that they were eating.
You know, I think people go into a restaurant,
and somebody orders a steak, and we all know where steak comes from,
and somebody orders a chicken, and we know what a chicken is,
but when they're eating bluefin sushi,
do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they're consuming?
These are the lions and tigers of the sea.
In reality, these animals have no terrestrial counterpart;
they're unique in the world.
These are animals that can practically swim
from the equator to the poles
and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year.
If we weren't so efficient at catching them, because they grow their entire life,
would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton.
But the truth is we're way too efficient at catching them,
and their stocks have collapsed worldwide.
that I photographed a couple years ago.
And every single day these tuna, bluefin like this,
are stacked up like cordwood,
just warehouse after warehouse.
As I wandered around and made these pictures,
it sort of occurred to me that the ocean's not a grocery store, you know.
We can't keep taking without expecting
serious consequences as a result.
how fish are caught, some of the methods that are used to catch fish,
like a bottom trawler, which is one of the most common methods in the world.
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp,
but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world.
You have a large net in the middle
with two steel doors on either end.
And as this assembly is towed through the water,
the doors meet resistance with the ocean,
and it opens the mouth of the net,
and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom.
And this just drags over the bottom, in this case to catch shrimp.
But as you can imagine, it's catching everything else in its path as well.
And it's destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom,
things like sponges and corals,
that critical habitat for other animals.
holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour.
So he had a handful of shrimp, maybe seven or eight shrimp,
and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch.
These are animals that died in the process,
but have no commercial value.
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner,
maybe seven or eight shrimp
and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process.
And to make that point even more visual, I swam under the shrimp boat
and made this picture of the guy shoveling
this bycatch into the sea as trash
and photographed this cascade of death,
you know, animals like guitarfish, bat rays,
flounder, pufferfish, that only an hour before,
were on the bottom of the ocean, alive,
but now being thrown back as trash.
because, currently on planet Earth,
we're killing over 100 million sharks
every single year.
But before I went out to photograph this component,
I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark
that will resonate with readers
You know, I think there's still a lot of people out there who think
the only good shark is a dead shark.
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher
that had just recently died in the gill net.
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible,
it struck me as sort of a crucifixion, if you will.
This ended up being the lead picture
in the global fishery story in National Geographic.
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice
of this problem of 100 million sharks.
I wanted to do another, more celebratory, story about sharks,
as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation.
So I went to the Bahamas
because there're very few places in the world
where sharks are doing well these days,
but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy,
largely due to the fact that the government there
had outlawed longlining several years ago.
And I wanted to show several species
that we hadn't shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations.
in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks
aggregate in shallow water.
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made
showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks
sort of just swimming around behind.
But the one thing I definitely didn't want to do with this coverage
was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters.
I didn't want them to be overly threatening or scary.
And with this photograph of a beautiful
15-feet, probably 14-feet, I guess,
female tiger shark,
I sort of think I got to that goal,
where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose,
and my strobe created a shadow on her face.
And I think it's a gentler picture, a little less threatening,
a little more respectful of the species.
for the elusive great hammerhead,
an animal that really hadn't been photographed much
until maybe about seven or 10 years ago.
It's a very solitary creature.
But this is an animal that's considered data deficient by science
in both Florida and in the Bahamas.
You know, we know almost nothing about them.
We don't know where they migrate to or from,
where they mate, where they have their pups,
and yet, hammerhead populations in the Atlantic
have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years.
You know, we're losing them faster than we can possibly find them.
an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species,
if you pay attention to such lists.
But it's an animal that's about 98 percent in decline
throughout most of its range.
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water,
and because we weren't working on the bottom,
I brought along a shark cage here,
and my friend, shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage.
You'll see that the photographer, of course, was not inside the cage here,
so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess.
I also wanted to focus on baby sharks, shark nurseries.
And I went to the island of Bimini, in the Bahamas,
to work with lemon shark pups.
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup,
and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives
in these protective mangroves.
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph.
It's not what you typically might think of as a shark picture.
But, you know, here we see a shark that's maybe 10 or 11 inches long
swimming in about a foot of water.
But this is crucial habitat and it's where they spend the first two, three years of their lives,
until they're big enough to go out on the rest of the reef.
After I left Bimini, I actually learned
that this habitat was being bulldozed
to create a new golf course and resort.
single, flagship species, if you will,
that are at risk in the ocean
as a way of talking about other threats.
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle.
This is the largest, widest-ranging,
deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species.
Here we see a female crawling
out of the ocean under moonlight
on the island of Trinidad.
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years.
And there was a time in their lifespan
where they were coming out of the water to nest
and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by.
And today, they crawl out and see condominiums.
But despite this amazing longevity,
they're now considered critically endangered.
In the Pacific, where I made this photograph,
their stocks have declined about 90 percent
in the last 15 years.
about to taste saltwater for the very first time
beginning this long and perilous journey.
Only one in a thousand
leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity.
But that's due to natural predators
like vultures that pick them off on a beach
or predatory fish that are waiting offshore.
Nature has learned to compensate with that,
and females have multiple clutches of eggs
to overcome those odds.
But what they can't deal with is anthropogenic stresses,
human things, like this picture that shows
a leatherback caught at night in a gill net.
I actually jumped in and photographed this,
and with the fisherman's permission,
I cut the turtle out, and it was able to swim free.
But, you know, thousands of other leatherbacks each year
are not so fortunate,
and the species' future is in great danger.
is the story I did on the right whale.
And essentially, the story is this with right whales,
that about a million years ago, there was
one species of right whale on the planet,
but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated,
the species sort of separated,
and today we have essentially two distinct stocks.
We have the Southern right whale that we see here
and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here
with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida.
Now, both species were hunted to the brink of extinction
by the early whalers,
but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better
because they're located in places
farther away from human activity.
the most endangered species on the planet today
because they are urban whales; they live along the east coast
of North America, United States and Canada,
and they have to deal with all these urban ills.
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida.
You can see the coal burning plant in the background.
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals
that are flushed out into the ocean,
and maybe even affecting their reproduction.
They also get entangled in fishing gear.
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale.
And those white markings are not natural markings.
These are entanglement scars.
72 percent of the population has such scars,
but most don't shed the gear, things like lobster traps and crab pots.
They hold on to them, and it eventually kills them.
And the other problem is they get hit by ships.
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship
in Nova Scotia, Canada
being towed in, where they did a necropsy
to confirm the cause of death,
which was indeed a ship strike.
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals
and keeping their numbers very low.
I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales
that had only been discovered about 10 years ago
in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand, a place called the Auckland Islands.
I went down there in the winter time.
And these are animals that had never seen humans before,
and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen.
And I got in the water with them,
and I was amazed at how curious they were.
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet
and one of these amazingly beautiful, 45-foot,
70-ton whales,
like a city bus just swimming up, you know.
They were in perfect condition,
very fat and healthy, robust, no entanglement scars,
the way they're supposed to look.
You know, I read that the pilgrims, when they landed at Plymouth Rock
in Massachusetts in 1620,
wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay
on the backs of right whales.
And we can't go back and see that today,
but maybe we can preserve what we have left.
a story I did on marine reserves
as sort of a solution
to the problem of overfishing, the global fish crisis story.
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand
because New Zealand was rather progressive,
and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean.
And I really wanted this story to be about three things:
I wanted it to be about abundance,
about diversity and about resilience.
And one of the first places I worked
was a reserve called Goat Island
in Leigh of New Zealand.
What the scientists there told me was that
when protected this first marine reserve in 1975,
they hoped and expected that certain things might happen.
like the New Zealand snapper would return
because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction.
And they did come back. What they couldn't predict was that other things would happen.
For example, these fish
predate on sea urchins,
and when the fish were all gone,
all anyone ever saw underwater
was just acres and acres of sea urchins.
But when the fish came back
and began predating and controlling the urchin population,
low and behold, kelp forests emerged in shallow water.
And that's because the urchins eat kelp.
So when the fish control the urchin population,
the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium.
You know, this is probably how the ocean looked here
one or 200 years ago, but nobody was around to tell us.
in beautiful, fragile, protected areas
like in Fiordland, where this sea pen colony was found.
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color.
In the northern part of New Zealand,
I dove in the blue water, where the water's a little warmer,
and photographed animals like this giant sting ray
swimming through an underwater canyon.
Every part of the ecosystem in this place
seems very healthy,
from tiny, little animals like a nudibrank
crawling over encrusting sponge
or a leatherjacket
that is a very important animal in this ecosystem
because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold.
a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand
when I just laid on the bottom
amidst a school of fish swirling around me.
And I was in a place that had only been protected
about 20 years ago.
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years,
and they said that the marine life was better here today
than it was in the 1960s.
And that's because it's been protected,
that it has come back.
The ocean is, indeed, resilient and tolerant to a point,
but we must be good custodians.
I became an underwater photographer
because I fell in love with the sea,
and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it,
and I don't think it's too late.
We're 25, 26 years after
the advent of the Macintosh,
which was an astoundingly seminal event
in the history
of human-machine interface
and in computation in general.
It fundamentally changed the way
that people thought about computation,
thought about computers,
how they used them and who and how many people were able to use them.
It was such a radical change, in fact,
that the early Macintosh development team
in '82, '83, '84
had to write an entirely new operating system from the ground up.
Now, this is an interesting little message,
and it's a lesson that has since, I think,
been forgotten or lost or something,
and that is, namely, that the OS is the interface.
The interface is the OS.
It's like the land and the king (i.e. Arthur) they're inseparable, they are one.
And to write a new operating system was not a capricious matter.
It wasn't just a matter of tuning up some graphics routines.
There were no graphics routines. There were no mouse drivers.
So it was a necessity.
we've seen all of the fundamental
supporting technologies go berserk.
So memory capacity and disk capacity
have been multiplied by something between 10,000 and a million.
Same thing for processor speeds.
Networks, we didn't have networks at all
at the time of the Macintosh's introduction,
and that has become the single most salient aspect
of how we live with computers.
And, of course, graphics: Today
84 dollars and 97 cents at Best Buy
buys you more graphics power
than you could have gotten for a million bucks from SGI only a decade ago.
So we've got that incredible ramp-up.
Then, on the side, we've got the Web
and, increasingly, the cloud,
which is fantastic,
but also -- in the regard in which an interface is fundamental --
kind of a distraction.
So we've forgotten to invent new interfaces.
Certainly we've seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard,
and people are starting to wake up about that.
So what happens next? Where do we go from there?
has to do with a single, simple word: "space,"
or a single, simple phrase:
"real world geometry."
Computers and the programming languages
that we talk to them in, that we teach them in,
are hideously insensate when it comes to space.
They don't understand real world space.
It's a funny thing because the rest of us occupy it quite frequently and quite well.
They also don't understand time, but that's a matter for a separate talk.
explain space to them?
One thing you might get is something like the Luminous Room.
The Luminous Room is a system
in which it's considered that
input and output spaces are co-located.
That's a strangely simple,
and yet unexplored idea, right?
When you use a mouse, your hand is down here on the mouse pad.
It's not even on the same plane as what you're talking about:
The pixels are up on the display.
So here was a room in which all the walls, floors, ceilings,
pets, potted plants, whatever was in there,
were capable, not only of display but of sensing as well.
And that means input and output are in the same space
enabling stuff like this.
That's a digital storage in a physical container.
The contract is the same
as with real word objects in real world containers.
Has to come back out, whatever you put in.
This little design experiment
that was a small office here knew a few other tricks as well.
If you presented it with a chess board,
it tried to figure out what you might mean by that.
And if there was nothing for them to do,
the chess pieces eventually got bored
and hopped away.
thought that that was too frivolous,
so we built deadly serious applications
like this optics prototyping workbench
in which a toothpaste cap on a cardboard box
becomes a laser.
The beam splitters and lenses are represented by physical objects,
and the system projects down the laser beam path.
So you've got an interface that has no interface.
You operate the world as you operate the real world,
which is to say, with your hands.
Similarly, a digital wind tunnel with digital wind
flowing from right to left --
not that remarkable in a sense; we didn't invent the mathematics.
But if you displayed that on a CRT or flat panel display,
it would be meaningless to hold up an arbitrary object,
a real world object in that.
Here, the real world merges with the simulation.
this is a system called Urp, for urban planners,
in which we give architects and urban planners back
the models that we confiscated
when we insisted that they use CAD systems.
And we make the machine meet them half way.
It projects down digital shadows, as you see here.
And if you introduce tools like this inverse clock,
then you can control the sun's position in the sky.
That's 8 a.m. shadows.
They get a little shorter at 9 a.m.
There you are, swinging the sun around.
Short shadows at noon and so forth.
And we built up a series of tools like this.
There are inter-shadowing studies
that children can operate,
even though they don't know anything about urban planning:
To move a building, you simply reach out your hand and you move the building.
A material wand makes the building
into a sort of Frank Gehry thing that reflects light in all directions.
Are you blinding passers by and motorists on the freeways?
A zoning tool connects distant structures, a building and a roadway.
Are you going to get sued by the zoning commission? And so forth.
Now, if these ideas seem familiar
or perhaps even a little dated,
that's great; they should seem familiar.
This stuff was undertaken at MIT and the Media Lab
under the incredible direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii,
director of the Tangible Media Group.
But it was that work that was seen
by Alex McDowell,
one of the world's legendary production designers.
But Alex was preparing a little, sort of obscure, indie, arthouse film
called "Minority Report" for Steven Spielberg,
and invited us to come out from MIT
and design the interfaces
that would appear in that film.
And the great thing about it was
that Alex was so dedicated to the idea of verisimilitude,
the idea that the putative 2054
that we were painting in the film be believable,
that he allowed us to take on that design work
as if it were an R&D effort.
And the result is sort of
gratifyingly perpetual.
People still reference those sequences in "Minority Report"
when they talk about new UI design.
So this led full circle, in a strange way,
to build these ideas into what we believe
is the necessary future of human machine interface:
the Spatial Operating Environment, we call it.
And, using a hand,
we can actually exercise six degrees of freedom,
six degrees of navigational control.
And it's fun to fly through Mr. Beckett's eye.
And you can come back out
through the scary orangutan.
And that's all well and good.
Let's do something a little more difficult.
Here, we have a whole bunch of disparate images.
We can fly around them.
So navigation is a fundamental issue.
You have to be able to navigate in 3D.
Much of what we want computers to help us with in the first place
is inherently spatial.
And the part that isn't spatial can often be spatialized
to allow our wetware to make greater sense of it.
Now we can distribute this stuff in many different ways.
So we can throw it out like that. Let's reset it.
We can organize it this way.
but about manipulation as well.
So if we don't like stuff,
or we're intensely curious about
Ernst Haeckel's scientific falsifications,
we can pull them out like that.
And then if it's time for analysis, we can pull back a little bit
and ask for a different distribution.
Let's just come down a bit
and fly around.
So that's a different way to look at stuff.
If you're of a more analytical nature
then you might want, actually, to look at this
as a color histogram.
So now we've got the stuff color-sorted,
angle maps onto color.
And now, if we want to select stuff,
3D, space,
the idea that we're tracking hands in real space
becomes really important because we can reach in,
not in 2D, not in fake 2D, but in actual 3D.
Here are some selection planes.
And we'll perform this Boolean operation
because we really love yellow and tapirs on green grass.
Here's a logistics system,
a small piece of one that we're currently building.
There're a lot of elements.
And one thing that's very important is to combine traditional tabular data
with three-dimensional and geospatial information.
So here's a familiar place.
And we'll bring this back here for a second.
Maybe select a little bit of that.
And bring out this graph.
And we should, now,
be able to fly in here
and have a closer look.
These are logistics elements
that are scattered across the United States.
and the general idea of imbuing
computation with space affords you
is a final destruction of that unfortunate
one-to-one pairing between human beings and computers.
That's the old way, that's the old mantra:
one machine, one human, one mouse, one screen.
Well, that doesn't really cut it anymore.
In the real world, we have people who collaborate;
we have people who have to work together,
and we have many different displays.
And we might want to look at these various images.
We might want to ask for some help.
is sitting over there,
so I can pull this from there to there.
These are unrelated machines, right?
So the computation is space soluble and network soluble.
So I'm going to leave that over there
because I have a question for Paul.
Paul is the designer of this wand, and maybe its easiest
for him to come over here and tell me in person what's going on.
So let me get some of these out of the way.
Let's pull this apart:
I'll go ahead and explode it.
Kevin, can you help?
Let me see if I can help us find the circuit board.
Mind you, it's a sort of gratuitous field-stripping exercise,
but we do it in the lab all the time.
All right.
So collaborative work, whether it's immediately co-located
or distant and distinct, is always important.
And again, that stuff
needs to be undertaken in the context of space.
that takes us back to the world of imagery.
This is a system called TAMPER,
which is a slightly whimsical look
at what the future of editing
and media manipulation systems might be.
We at Oblong believe that media should be
accessible in much more fine-grained form.
So we have a large number of movies
stuck inside here.
And let's just pick out a few elements.
We can zip through them
as a possibility.
We can grab elements off the front,
where upon they reanimate, come to life,
and drag them down onto the table here.
We'll go over to Jacques Tati here
and grab our blue friend
and put him down on the table as well.
We may need more than one.
And we probably need,
well, we probably need a cowboy
to be quite honest.
(Laughter)
Yeah, let's
take that one.
(Laughter)
You see, cowboys and French farce people
don't go well together, and the system knows that.
and that is that
one of the greatest English language writers
of the last three decades
suggested that great art is always a gift.
And he wasn't talking about whether the novel costs 24.95 [dollars],
or whether you have to spring 70 million bucks
to buy the stolen Vermeer;
he was talking about the circumstances of its creation
and of its existence.
And I think that it's time that we asked
for the same from technology.
Technology is capable of
expressing and being imbued with
a certain generosity,
and we need to demand that, in fact.
For some of this kind of technology,
ground center is
a combination of design, which is crucially important.
We can't have advances in technology any longer
unless design is integrated from the very start.
And, as well, as of efficacy, agency.
We're, as human beings, the creatures that create,
and we should make sure that our machines aid us in that task
and are built in that same image.
actually this is from Bill Gates --
when? (John Underkoffler: When?)
CA: When real? When for us, not just in a lab and on a stage?
Can it be for every man, or is this just for corporations and movie producers?
That's our goal entirely.
We won't have succeeded
unless we take that next big step.
I mean it's been 25 years.
Can there really be only one interface? There can't.
you need projectors, cameras?
You know, how can it work?
It'll be built into architecture.
The gloves go away in a matter of months or years.
So this is the inevitability about it.
someone can buy this as part of
a standard computer interface?
you'll get this.
(Applause)
The world has a habit of surprising us as to how these things are actually used.
What do you think, what in your mind is the first killer app for this?
At the moment, our early-adopter customers --
and these systems are deployed out in the real world --
do all the big data intensive, data heavy problems with it.
So, whether it's logistics and supply chain management
or natural gas and resource extraction,
financial services, pharmaceuticals, bioinformatics,
those are the topics right now, but that's not a killer app.
And I understand what you're asking.
(Laughter)
John, thank you for making science-fiction real.
Thank you to you all.
I want to talk about
what we learn from conservatives.
And I'm at a stage in life where I'm yearning for my old days,
so I want to confess to you
that when I was a kid,
indeed, I was a conservative.
I was a Young Republican, a Teenage Republican,
a leader in the Teenage Republicans.
Indeed, I was the youngest member
of any delegation
in the 1980 convention that elected Ronald Reagan
to be the Republican nominee for president.
(Laughter)
You're thinking, "That's not what the Internets say."
You're thinking, "Wikipedia doesn't say this fact."
And indeed, this is just one of the examples
of the junk that flows across the tubes
in these Internets here.
Wikipedia reports that this guy,
this former congressman from Erie, Pennsylvania
was, at the age of 20, one of the youngest people
at the Republican National Convention,
but it's just not true.
(Laughter)
Indeed, it drives me so nuts, let me just change this little fact here.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
All right. Okay, so ... perfect.
Perfect.
(Laughter)
Okay, speaker Lawrence Lessig, right.
Okay.
Finally, truth will be brought here.
Okay, see? It's done. It's almost done. Here we go.
"... Youngest Republican," okay, we're finished.
That's it. Please save this.
Great, here we go.
And ... Wikipedia is fixed, finally.
Okay, but no, this is really besides the point.
not so much this issue of the 1980 convention --
the thing to think about is this:
They go to church.
Now, you know, I mean, a lot of people go to church.
I'm not talking about that only conservatives go to church.
And I'm not talking about the God thing.
I don't want to get into that, you know; that's not my point.
They go to church, by which I mean,
they do lots of things for free for each other.
They hold potluck dinners.
Indeed, they sell books about potluck dinners.
They serve food to poor people.
They share, they give,
they give away for free.
And it's the very same people
who, on Sundays, show up
and share.
And not only food, right.
are strong believers, in lots of contexts,
in the limits on the markets.
They are in many important places
against markets.
Indeed, they, like all of us, celebrate this kind of relationship.
But they're very keen that we don't
let money drop into that relationship,
else it turns into something like this.
They want to regulate us, those conservatives,
to stop us from allowing the market to spread in those places.
Because they understand:
There are places for the market
and places where the market should not exist,
where we should be free
to enjoy the fellowship of others.
They recognize: Both of these things have to live together.
they get ecology.
Right, it was the first great Republican president of the 20th century
who taught us about
environmental thinking -- Teddy Roosevelt.
They first taught us about ecology
in the context of natural resources.
And then they began to teach us in the context of
innovation, economics.
They understand, in that context,
"free." They understand "free" is an important
essential part of the
cultural ecology as well.
That's the thing I want you to think about them.
you don't believe me, really, here.
So here's exhibit number one.
I want to share with you my latest hero, Julian Sanchez,
a libertarian who works at the, for many people,
"evil" Cato Institute.
Okay, so Julian made this video.
He's a terrible producer of videos,
but it's great content, so I'm going to give you a little bit of it.
So here he is beginning.
remix culture seems to be evolving ...
about these three videos.
This is this fantastic Brat Pack remix
set to Lisztomania.
Which, of course, spread virally.
Hugely successful.
And then some people from Brooklyn saw it.
They decided they wanted to do the same.
And then, of course, people from San Fransisco saw it.
And San Franciscans thought they had to do the same as well.
And so they're beautiful, but this libertarian
has some important lessons he wants us to learn from this.
Here's lesson number one.
They are acting in the sense that they're
emulating the original mashup.
And the guy who shot it obviously has a strong eye
and some experience with video editing.
But this is also basically just a group of friends
having an authentic social moment
and screwing around together.
It should feel familiar and kind of resonate
for anyone who's had a sing-a-long or a dance party
with a group of good friends.
because here, remix isn't just about
an individual doing something alone in his basement;
it becomes an act of social creativity.
And it's not just that it yields
a different kind of product at the end,
All of our normal social interactions
become a kind of invitation
to this sort of collective expression.
It's our real social lives themselves
that are transmuted into art.
individuals using our shared culture
as a kind of language to communicate something to an audience.
Stage two, social remix,
is really about using it to mediate
people's relationships to each other.
First, within each video,
the Brat Pack characters are used as a kind of template
for performing the social reality of each group.
But there's also a dialogue between the videos,
where, once the basic structure is established,
it becomes a kind of platform
for articulating the similarities and differences
between the groups' social and physical worlds.
the critical key to what
Julian has to say ...
how to incentivize the production
of a certain kind of artistic commodity;
it's about what level of control
we're going to permit to be exercised
over our social realities --
social realities that are now inevitably
permeated by pop culture.
I think it's important that we
keep these two different kinds of public goods in mind.
If we're only focused on how to maximize
the supply of one,
I think we risk suppressing
this different and richer
and, in some ways, maybe even more important one.
Freedom needs this opportunity
to both have the commercial success
of the great commercial works
and the opportunity
to build this different kind of culture.
And for that to happen, you need
ideas like fair use to be central and protected,
to enable this kind of innovation,
as this libertarian tells us,
between these two creative cultures,
a commercial and a sharing culture.
The point is they, he, here,
gets that culture.
too often, not so much.
All right, take for example this great company.
In the good old days when this Republican ran that company,
their greatest work was work that built on the past, right.
All of the great Disney works
were works that took works that
were in the public domain and remixed them,
or waited until they entered the public domain to remix them,
to celebrate this add-on remix creativity.
Indeed, Mickey Mouse himself, of course,
as "Steamboat Willie,"
is a remix of the then, very dominant,
very popular "Steamboat Bill"
by Buster Keaton.
This man was a remixer extraordinaire.
He is the celebration and ideal
of exactly this kind of creativity.
through this dark stage
to this Democrat.
Wildly different.
This is the mastermind behind
the eventual passage of what we call
the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act,
extending the term of existing copyrights
by 20 years,
so that no one could do to Disney
what Disney did to the Brothers Grimm.
Now, when we tried to challenge this,
going to the Supreme Court, getting the Supreme Court, the bunch of conservatives there --
if we could get them to wake up to this -- to strike it down,
we had the assistance of Nobel Prize winners
including this right-wing
Nobel Prize winner, Milton Friedman,
who said he would join our brief
only if the word "no brainer"
was in the brief somewhere.
(Laughter)
But apparently, no brains
existed in this place
when Democrats passed and signed
this bill into law.
Now, tiny little quibble of a footnote:
Sonny Bono, you might say, was a Republican,
but I don't buy it.
This guy is no Republican.
think about this cultural hero,
icon on the Left,
creator of this character.
Look at the site that he built: "Star Wars" MashUps,
inviting people to come and use their creative energy
to produce a new generation of attention
towards this extraordinarily important cultural icon.
Read the license.
The license for these remixers
assigns all of the rights
to the remix back to Lucas.
The mashup is owned by Lucas.
Indeed, anything you add to the mashup,
music you might add,
Lucas has a worldwide perpetual right
to exploit that for free.
There is no creator here to be recognized.
The creator doesn't have any rights.
The creator is a sharecropper in this story.
And we should remember
who employed the sharecroppers:
the Democrats, right?
recognize that there's a certain need
of ownership,
a respect for ownership,
the respect we should give the creator,
the remixer, the owner, the property owner,
the copyright owner
of this extraordinarily powerful stuff,
and not a generation of sharecroppers.
Now, I think there are lessons we should learn here,
lessons about openness.
Our lives are sharing activities,
at least in part.
Even for the head of Goldman Sachs,
at least in part.
And for that sharing activity to happen, we have to have
well-protected spaces of fair use.
This ecology of sharing
needs freedom
within which to create.
Freedom, which means without permission from anyone,
the ability to create.
And number three: We need to
respect the creator,
the creator of these remixes
through rights that are
directly tied to them.
Creative Commons.
Actually, it's not a right-wing nonprofit,
but of course -- let me just tie it here --
the Creative Commons, which is
offering authors this simple way to mark their content
with the freedoms
they intended to carry.
to a "some rights reserved" world
so that people can know the freedoms they have attached to the content,
building and creating
on the basis of this
creative copyrighted work.
These tools that we built
enable this sharing in parts
through licenses that make it clear
and a freedom to create
without requiring permission first
because the permission has already been granted
and a respect for the creator because it builds upon
a copyright the creator
has licensed freely.
And it explains the vast right-wing conspiracy
that's obviously developed around these licenses,
as now more than 350 million digital objects
are out there, licensed freely
in this way.
the picture of an ecology
of balanced creativity,
is that the ecology of creativity we have right now?
Well, as you all know,
not many of us believe we do.
I tripped on the reality of this ecology of creativity
just last week.
I created a video which was based
on a Wireside Chat that I'd given,
and I uploaded it to YouTube.
I then got this email from YouTube
weirdly notifying me
that there was content in that
owned by the mysterious WMG
that matched their content ID.
So I didn't think much about it.
"Your talk on YouTube was DMCA'd. Was that your purpose?"
imagining that I had this deep conspiracy
to reveal the obvious flaws in the DMCA.
I answered, "No." I didn't even think about it.
But then I went to the site
and all of the audio in my site had been silenced.
My whole 45-minute video
had been silenced
because there were snippets in that video,
a video about fair use,
that included Warner Music Group music.
Now, interestingly,
they still sold ads for that music,
if you played the silent video.
You could still buy the music,
but you couldn't hear anything
because it had been silenced.
says I must do
to be free to use
YouTube to talk about fair use.
I went to this site, and I had to answer these questions.
And then in an extraordinarily
Bart Simpson-like, juvenile way
you've actually got to type out these words
and get them right
to reassert your freedom to speak.
And I felt like I was in third grade again.
"I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair.
I will not put tacks on the teacher's chair."
This is absurd.
It is outrageous.
It is an extraordinary perversion of the system of freedom
we should be encouraging.
Well, interestingly, in the last presidential election,
who was the number one, active
opponent of this system of regulation
in online speech?
John McCain.
Letter after letter attacking YouTube's refusal
to be more respectful of fair use
with their extraordinary notice and take down system,
that led his campaign so many times
to be thrown off the Internet.
my good old days of right-wing lunacy.
Let me come back to now,
now when I'm a little leftist --
I'm certainly left-handed, so at least a lefty --
And I wonder, can we on the Left
expect to build this
ecology of freedom, now,
in a world where
we know the extraordinarily powerful
influences against it,
where even icons of the Left like this
entertain and push bills
that would effectively ban the requirement
of open access for government-funded research?
The president, who has supported
a process that secretly negotiates agreements,
which effectively lock us into the insane system
of DMCA
that we have adopted
and likely lock us down a path of three strikes, you're out
that, of course, the rest of the world are increasingly adopting.
Not a single example of reform
has been produced yet.
And we're not going to see this change
in this system
anytime soon.
that I think we need to learn.
Openness is a commitment
to a certain set of values.
We need to speak of those values.
The value of freedom. It's a value of community.
It's a value of the limits in regulation.
It's a value respecting the creator.
Now, if we can learn those values
from at least some influences on the Right,
if we can take them and incorporate them,
maybe we could do a little trade.
We learn those values on the Left,
and maybe they'll do health care
or global warming legislation or something in the Right.
in teaching these values.
Do you worry about what is going to kill you?
Heart disease, cancer,
a car accident?
Most of us worry about things we can't control,
like war, terrorism,
the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti.
But what really threatens humanity?
A few years ago, Professor Vaclav Smil
tried to calculate the probability
of sudden disasters
large enough to change history.
He called these,
"massively fatal discontinuities,"
meaning that they could kill
up to 100 million people
in the next 50 years.
He looked at the odds of another world war,
of a massive volcanic eruption,
even of an asteroid hitting the Earth.
But he placed the likelihood of one such event
above all others
at close to 100 percent,
and that is a severe flu pandemic.
Now, you might think of flu
as just a really bad cold,
but it can be a death sentence.
Every year, 36,000 people in the United States
die of seasonal flu.
In the developing world, the data is much sketchier
but the death toll is almost
certainly higher.
You know, the problem is if
this virus occasionally mutates
so dramatically,
it essentially is a new virus
and then we get a pandemic.
that killed some 50 to 100 million people.
It spread like wildfire
and some died within hours of developing symptoms.
Are we safer today?
Well, we seem to have dodged
the deadly pandemic this year
that most of us feared,
but this threat could reappear at any time.
The good news is that
we're at a moment in time
when science, technology, globalization is converging
to create an unprecedented possibility:
the possibility to make history
by preventing infectious diseases
that still account for one-fifth of all deaths
and countless misery on Earth.
We can do this.
We're already preventing millions of deaths
with existing vaccines,
and if we get these to more people,
we can certainly save more lives.
But with new or better vaccines
for malaria, TB, HIV,
pneumonia, diarrhea, flu,
we could end suffering
that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time.
But first, I have to explain why they're important
because vaccines, the power of them,
is really like a whisper.
When they work, they can make history,
but after a while
you can barely hear them.
Now, some of us are old enough
to have a small, circular scar on our arms
from an inoculation we received as children.
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox,
a disease that killed half a billion people last century
and no longer is with us?
Or polio? How many of you remember the iron lung?
We don't see scenes like this anymore
because of vaccines.
because there are 30-odd diseases
that can be treated with vaccines now,
but we're still threatened by things like HIV and flu.
Why is that?
Well, here's the dirty little secret.
Until recently, we haven't had to know
exactly how a vaccine worked.
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error.
You took a pathogen, you modified it,
you injected it into a person or an animal
and you saw what happened.
This worked well for most pathogens,
somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu,
but not at all for HIV,
for which humans have no natural immunity.
They basically create a cache
of weapons for your immune system
which you can deploy when needed.
Now, when you get a viral infection,
what normally happens is it takes days or weeks
for your body to fight back
at full strength,
and that might be too late.
When you're pre-immunized,
what happens is you have forces in your body
pre-trained to recognize
and defeat specific foes.
So that's really how vaccines work.
Now, let's take a look at a video
that we're debuting at TED, for the first time,
on how an effective HIV vaccine might work.
how to recognize and neutralize
a specific invader.
After HIV penetrates the body's mucosal barriers,
it infects immune cells to replicate.
The invader draws the attention
of the immune system's front-line troops.
Dendritic cells, or macrophages,
capture the virus and display pieces of it.
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine
are activated when they learn
HIV is present from the front-line troops.
These memory cells immediately deploy
the exact weapons needed.
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells,
which produce wave after wave
of the specific antibodies
that latch onto HIV
to prevent it from infecting cells,
while squadrons of killer T cells
seek out and destroy cells
that are already HIV infected.
The virus is defeated.
Without a vaccine,
these responses would have taken more than a week.
By that time, the battle against HIV
would already have been lost.
The antibodies you just saw in this video,
in action, are the ones that make most vaccines work.
So the real question then is:
How do we ensure that your body makes
the exact ones that we need to protect
against flu and HIV?
The principal challenge for both of these viruses
is that they're always changing.
So let's take a look at the flu virus.
In this rendering of the flu virus,
these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you.
And also, what the antibodies use is a handle
to essentially grab and neutralize the virus.
When these mutate, they change their shape,
and the antibodies don't know what they're looking at anymore.
So that's why every year
you can catch a slightly different strain of flu.
It's also why in the spring,
we have to make a best guess
at which three strains are going to prevail the next year,
put those into a single vaccine
and rush those into production for the fall.
the most common influenza -- influenza A --
also infects animals
that live in close proximity to humans,
and they can recombine
in those particular animals.
In addition, wild aquatic birds
carry all known strains
of influenza.
So, you've got this situation:
In 2003,
we had an H5N1 virus
that jumped from birds into humans
in a few isolated cases
with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent.
Now luckily, that particular virus,
although very scary at the time,
did not transmit from person to person
very easily.
This year's H1N1 threat
was actually a human, avian, swine mixture
that arose in Mexico.
It was easily transmitted,
but, luckily, was pretty mild.
And so, in a sense,
our luck is holding out,
but you know, another wild bird could fly over at anytime.
As variable as flu is,
HIV makes flu
look like the Rock of Gibraltar.
The virus that causes AIDS
is the trickiest pathogen
scientists have ever confronted.
It mutates furiously,
it has decoys to evade the immune system,
it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it
and it quickly hides itself
in your genome.
Here's a slide looking at
the genetic variation of flu
and comparing that to HIV,
a much wilder target.
In the video a moment ago,
you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells.
Now realize that in a recently infected person,
there are millions of these ships;
each one is just slightly different.
Finding a weapon that recognizes
and sinks all of them
makes the job that much harder.
was identified as the cause of AIDS,
we've developed more drugs to treat HIV
than all other viruses put together.
These drugs aren't cures,
but they represent a huge triumph of science
because they take away the automatic death sentence
from a diagnosis of HIV,
at least for those who can access them.
The vaccine effort though is really quite different.
Large companies moved away from it
because they thought the science was so difficult
and vaccines were seen as poor business.
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine,
but today, evidence tells us otherwise.
we had surprising but exciting findings
from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand.
For the first time, we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans --
albeit, quite modestly --
and that particular vaccine was made
almost a decade ago.
Newer concepts and early testing now
show even greater promise in the best of our animal models.
But in the past few months, researchers have also isolated
several new broadly neutralizing antibodies
from the blood of an HIV infected individual.
Now, what does this mean?
We saw earlier that HIV
is highly variable,
that a broad neutralizing antibody
latches on and disables
multiple variations of the virus.
If you take these and you put them
in the best of our monkey models,
they provide full protection from infection.
In addition, these researchers found
a new site on HIV
where the antibodies can grab onto,
and what's so special about this spot
is that it changes very little
as the virus mutates.
It's like, as many times
as the virus changes its clothes,
it's still wearing the same socks,
and now our job is to make sure
we get the body to really hate those socks.
The Thai results tell us
we can make an AIDS vaccine,
and the antibody findings
tell us how we might do that.
This strategy, working backwards
from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate,
has never been done before in vaccine research.
It's called retro-vaccinology,
and its implications extend
way beyond that of just HIV.
So think of it this way.
We've got these new antibodies we've identified,
and we know that they latch onto many, many variations of the virus.
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part,
so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part,
present that through a vaccine,
what we hope is we can prompt
your immune system to make these matching antibodies.
And that would create
a universal HIV vaccine.
Now, it sounds easier than it is
because the structure actually looks more like
this blue antibody diagram
attached to its yellow binding site,
and as you can imagine, these three-dimensional structures
are much harder to work on.
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this,
we'd love to hear about it.
has really helped with innovation with other diseases.
So for instance, a biotechnology company
has now found broadly neutralizing
antibodies to influenza,
as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus.
They're currently making a cocktail --
an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat
severe, overwhelming cases of flu.
In the longer term, what they can do
is use these tools of retro-vaccinology
to make a preventive flu vaccine.
Now, retro-vaccinology is just one technique
within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design.
We talked about before the H and N spikes
on the surface of the flu virus.
Notice these other, smaller protuberances.
These are largely hidden from the immune system.
Now it turns out that these spots
also don't change much when the virus mutates.
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies,
you could cripple all versions of the flu.
So far, animal tests indicate
that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease,
although you might get a mild case.
So if this works in humans, what we're talking about
is a universal flu vaccine,
one that doesn't need to change every year
and would remove the threat of death.
We really could think of flu, then,
as just a bad cold.
is only valuable to the extent
we get it to everyone who needs it.
So to do that, we have to combine
smart vaccine design with smart production methods
and, of course, smart delivery methods.
So I want you to think back a few months ago.
In June, the World Health Organization
declared the first global
flu pandemic in 41 years.
The U.S. government promised
150 million doses of vaccine
by October 15th for the flu peak.
Vaccines were promised to developing countries.
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent
and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing.
So what happened?
how to make flu vaccines, how to produce them,
in the early 1940s.
It was a slow, cumbersome process
that depended on chicken eggs,
millions of living chicken eggs.
Viruses only grow in living things,
and so it turned out that, for flu,
chicken eggs worked really well.
For most strains, you could get one to two doses
of vaccine per egg.
Luckily for us,
we live in an era of breathtaking
biomedical advances.
So today, we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs,
(Laughter)
hundreds of millions of chicken eggs.
Almost nothing has changed.
The system is reliable
but the problem is you never know how well
a strain is going to grow.
This year's swine flu strain
grew very poorly in early production:
basically .6 doses per egg.
So, here's an alarming thought.
What if that wild bird flies by again?
You could see an avian strain
that would infect the poultry flocks,
and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines.
So, Dan [Barber], if you want
billions of chicken pellets
for your fish farm,
I know where to get them.
So right now, the world can produce
about 350 million doses
of flu vaccine for the three strains,
and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses
if we want to target a single variant
like swine flu.
But this assumes that our factories are humming
because, in 2004,
the U.S. supply was cut in half
by contamination at one single plant.
And the process still takes
more than half a year.
than we were in 1918?
Well, with the new technologies emerging now,
I hope we can say definitively, "Yes."
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine
for everyone in the entire world
for less than half of what we're currently spending
now in the United States.
With a range of new technologies, we could.
Here's an example:
A company I'm engaged with has found
a specific piece of the H spike of flu
that sparks the immune system.
If you lop this off and attach it
to the tail of a different bacterium,
which creates a vigorous immune response,
they've created a very powerful flu fighter.
This vaccine is so small
it can be grown in a common bacteria, E. coli.
Now, as you know, bacteria reproduce quickly --
it's like making yogurt --
and so we could produce enough swine origin flu
for the entire world in a few factories, in a few weeks,
with no eggs,
for a fraction of the cost of current methods.
And, aside from the radically increased production
and huge cost savings --
for example, the E. coli method I just talked about --
look at the time saved: this would be lives saved.
The developing world,
mostly left out of the current response,
sees the potential of these alternate technologies
and they're leapfrogging the West.
India, Mexico and others are already
making experimental flu vaccines,
and they may be the first place
we see these vaccines in use.
Because these technologies are so efficient
and relatively cheap,
billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines
if we can figure out how to deliver them.
New infectious diseases
appear or reappear
every few years.
Some day, perhaps soon,
we'll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us.
Will we be quick enough to react
before millions die?
Luckily, this year's flu was relatively mild.
I say, "luckily" in part
because virtually no one in the developing world
was vaccinated.
So if we have the political and financial foresight
to sustain our investments,
we will master these and new tools of vaccinology,
and with these tools we can produce
enough vaccine for everyone at low cost
and ensure healthy productive lives.
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year.
No longer does AIDS
need to kill two million a year.
No longer do the poor and vulnerable
need to be threatened by infectious diseases,
or indeed, anybody.
Instead of having Vaclav Smil's
"massively fatal discontinuity" of life,
we can ensure
the continuity of life.
What the world needs now are these new vaccines,
and we can make it happen.
(Applause)
Thank you.
So, the science is changing.
In your mind, Seth -- I mean, you must dream about this --
what is the kind of time scale
on, let's start with HIV,
for a game-changing vaccine that's actually out there and usable?
because the problem we have now is
we've shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans;
we just need a better one.
And with these types of antibodies, we know humans can make them.
So, if we can figure out how to do that,
then we have the vaccine,
and what's interesting is there already is
some evidence that we're beginning to crack that problem.
So, the challenge is full speed ahead.
but it's been 10 years every 10 years.
So I hate to put a timeline
on scientific innovation,
but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends.
we've got a bunch -- I just showed some of this --
a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now.
They look good. The problem has been that,
what we did is we invested in traditional technologies
because that's what we were comfortable with.
You also can use adjuvants, which are chemicals you mix.
That's what Europe is doing, so we could have diluted out
our supply of flu and made more available,
but, going back to what Michael Specter said,
the anti-vaccine crowd didn't really want that to happen.
that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial
and is currently in phase three trials now.
It probably isn't the perfect vaccine, but it's moving along.
we produce something;
we get that kind of gratification.
You've been slaving away at this for more than a decade,
and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do.
The world needs people like you. Thank you.
Today, I want you to look at
children who become suicide bombers
through a completely different lens.
In 2009, there were 500
bomb blasts across Pakistan.
I spent the year working
with children
who were training to become suicide bombers
and with Taliban recruiters,
trying to understand how the Taliban
were converting these children
into live ammunition
and why these children were actively
signing up to their cause.
from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."
They target poor families
and convince the parents to send their children.
In return, they provide free food and shelter
and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.
We've obtained a propaganda video
made by the Taliban.
Young boys are taught justifications
for suicide attacks
and the execution of spies.
who studied in a madrassa like this.
Hazrat Ali is from a
poor farming family in Swat.
He joined the Taliban a year ago
when he was 13.
Then they take us to a madrassa
and teach us things from the Koran.
are then given months of military training.
rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.
They ask us to use them only against the infidels.
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.
have seen that the Taliban have perfected
the way in which they recruit
and train children,
and I think it's a five-step process.
Step one is that the Taliban prey
on families that are large, that are poor,
that live in rural areas.
They separate the parents from the children
by promising to provide food, clothing,
shelter to these children.
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away
to hard-line schools
that run along the Taliban agenda.
They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,
in Arabic, a language these children do not understand
and cannot speak.
They rely very heavily on teachers,
who I have personally seen
distort the message to these children
as and when it suits their purpose to.
These children are explicitly forbidden
from reading newspapers, listening to radio,
reading any books
that the teachers do not prescribe them.
If any child is found violating these rules,
he is severely reprimanded.
Effectively, the Taliban create
a complete blackout
of any other source of information for these children.
to hate the world that they currently live in.
So they beat these children --
I have seen it;
they feed them twice a day dried bread and water;
they rarely allow them to play games;
they tell them that, for eight hours at a time,
all they have to do is read the Koran.
The children are virtual prisoners;
they cannot leave, they cannot go home.
Their parents are so poor,
they have no resources to get them back.
the fighters,
start talking to the younger boys
about the glories of martyrdom.
They talk to them about how when they die,
they will be received up
with lakes of honey and milk,
how there will be 72 virgins
waiting for them in paradise,
how there will be unlimited food,
and how this glory
is going to propel them to become
heroes in their neighborhoods.
Effectively, this is the brainwashing process
that has begun.
one of the most effective
means of propaganda.
Their videos that they use
are intercut with photographs
of men and women and children
dying in Iraq and Afghanistan
and in Pakistan.
And the basic message is that the Western powers
do not care about civilian deaths,
so those people who live
in areas and support governments
that work with Western powers are fair game.
That's why Pakistani civilians,
over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,
are fair game.
Now these children are primed
to become suicide bombers.
They're ready to go out and fight
because they've been told that this is
effectively their only way
to glorify Islam.
He blew himself up, killing six.
This boy is called Sadik.
He killed 22.
This boy is called Messoud.
He killed 28.
The Taliban are running suicide schools,
preparing a generation of boys
for atrocities against civilians.
But only if I get permission from my dad.
When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,
I get so inspired by their terrific attacks.
from carrying out a suicide attack?
"Why did you do that?"
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."
Then God will look at my intention.
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,
then I will be rewarded with paradise.
♫ My God will call me ♫
♫ My body will be put back together ♫
♫ And God will ask me why I did this ♫
If you grew up in these circumstances,
faced with these choices,
would you choose to live in this world
or in the glorious afterlife?
As one Taliban recruiter told me,
"There will always be sacrificial lambs in this war."
(Applause)
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.
She's an Italian fashion designer.
She goes to this vintage store in Paris
with a friend of hers.
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --
she loves it.
She's turning it inside out.
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.
Her friend says, "Buy it already."
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."
Now, the academics in this audience may think,
"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."
But to a fashionista, what it really is
is a sign of Prada's genius:
that she can root through the history of fashion
and pick the one jacket
that doesn't need to be changed by one iota,
and to be current and to be now.
that this is illegal for her to do this.
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.
In the fashion industry, there's very little
intellectual property protection.
They have trademark protection,
but no copyright protection
and no patent protection to speak of.
All they have, really, is trademark protection,
and so it means that anybody
could copy any garment
on any person in this room
and sell it as their own design.
The only thing that they can't copy
is the actual trademark label
within that piece of apparel.
That's one reason that you see logos
splattered all over these products.
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists
to knock off these designs
because they can't knock off the logo.
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.
(Laughter) Well, yeah.
Canal Street, I know.
And sometimes these are fun, right?
doesn't have any copyright protection
is because the courts decided long ago
that apparel is too utilitarian
to qualify for copyright protection.
They didn't want a handful of designers
owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve
because Joe Blow owns it.
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?
This is Vivienne Westwood. No!
We think of it as maybe too silly,
too unnecessary.
behind copyright protection --
which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --
might be really surprised
by both the critical success of the fashion industry
and the economic success of this industry.
What I'm going to argue today is that
because there's no copyright protection
in the fashion industry,
fashion designers have actually been able to elevate
utilitarian design,
things to cover our naked bodies,
into something that we consider art.
Because there's no copyright protection
in this industry,
there's a very open and creative
ecology of creativity.
who are sculptors or photographers
or filmmakers or musicians,
fashion designers can sample
from all their peers' designs.
They can take any element from any garment
from the history of fashion
and incorporate it into their own design.
They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.
And here, I suspect,
they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.
Maybe just a little.
Can't copyright a costume either.
the broadest palette imaginable
in this creative industry.
This wedding dress here
is actually made of sporks,
and this dress is actually made of aluminum.
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes
as they walk through.
So, one of the magical side effects
of having a culture of copying,
which is really what it is,
is the establishment of trends.
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.
there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain
who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,
but if you talk to any designer at any level,
including these high-end designers,
they always say
their main inspiration comes from the street:
where people like you and me remix and match
our own fashion looks.
And that's where they really get a lot of their
creative inspiration,
so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.
probably benefited the most
from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs
and selling them at very low prices.
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,
but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need
any more intellectual property protection."
When you look at copies like this,
you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands
remain in business?
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.
We invited Tom Ford to come --
the conference was called, "Ready to Share:
Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --
and we asked him exactly this question.
Here's what he had to say.
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,
in case you didn't know.
that -- actually not much research, quite simple research --
that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.
The people on Santee Alley
are not the ones who shop at Gucci.
(Laughter)
This is a very different demographic.
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same
as an original high-end design,
at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.
But even sometimes a cheaper version
can actually have some charming aspects,
can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.
There's lots of virtues of copying.
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to
is that we now have
a much broader palette
of design choices to choose from than we ever have before,
and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.
helps you project who you are to the world.
Because of fast fashion,
global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;
they want trends to be set
so that they can move product.
For fashionistas,
they want to stay ahead of the curve.
They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.
And so, they want to move on to the next trend
as soon as possible.
Every season, these designers have to struggle
to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.
And this, let me tell you,
is very good for the bottom line.
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects
that this culture of copying has
on the creative process.
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.
He has complained a lot about people copying him,
but in one interview I read,
he said it has really forced him to up his game.
He had to come up with new ideas,
new things that would be hard to copy.
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel
that has to be made out of steel or titanium;
if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,
it'll actually crack in two.
It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)
of jazz great, Charlie Parker.
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop
was that he was pretty sure
that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,
and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.
They're trying to put together
a signature look, an aesthetic
that reflects who they are.
When people knock it off, everybody knows
because they've put that look out on the runway,
and it's a coherent aesthetic.
Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter)
I don't know if you know that jokes
also can't be copyright protected.
So when one-liners were really popular,
everybody stole them from one another.
But now, we have a different kind of comic.
They develop a persona,
a signature style, much like fashion designers.
And their jokes,
much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,
really only work within that aesthetic.
If somebody steals a joke
from Larry David, for instance,
it's not as funny.
to survive in this culture of copying
is they've learned how to copy themselves.
They knock themselves off.
They make deals with the fast fashion giants
and they come up with a way to sell their product
to a whole new demographic:
the Santee Alley demographic.
"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.
In other countries there is protection
for our artful designs."
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,
it turns out that the protection that's offered
is really ineffectual.
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,
they have a design law; it protects apparel,
but the novelty standard is so high,
you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,
it's totally unique.
And that's sort of like
the novelty standard for a U.S. patent,
which fashion designers never get --
rarely get here in the states.
Very low novelty standard,
anybody can register anything.
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry
and you have a lot of luxury designers there,
they don't register their garments, generally,
and there's not a lot of litigation.
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,
cut off three inches from the bottom,
go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.
If you look at the registry, actually,
a lot of the registered things in the E.U.
are Nike T-shirts
that are almost identical to one another.
She is the head of
the Council of Fashion Designers of America,
and she has told her constituency that
she is going to get copyright protection
for fashion designs.
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,
because they realized it is so hard
to tell the difference between a pirated design
and something that's just part of a global trend.
Who owns a look?
That is a very difficult question to answer.
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,
and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.
that doesn't have copyright protection.
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,
including the food industry.
You cannot copyright a recipe
because it's a set of instructions, it's fact,
and you cannot copyright the look and feel
of even the most unique dish.
Same with automobiles.
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,
you cannot copyright the sculptural design.
It's a utilitarian article, that's why.
Same with furniture,
it's too utilitarian.
Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:
no copyright protection.
Hairdos, no copyright protection.
Open source software, these guys decided
they didn't want copyright protection.
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.
They share their designs.
Jokes, no copyright protection.
Fireworks displays,
the rules of games,
the smell of perfume: no.
And some of these industries may seem
sort of marginal to you,
but these are the gross sales
for low I.P. industries,
industries with very little copyright protection,
and there's the gross sales of
films and books.
(Applause)
It ain't pretty.
and they're like, "Shhh!
Don't tell anybody
we can actually steal from each other's designs.
It's embarrassing."
But you know what? It's revolutionary,
and it's a model that a lot of other industries --
like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --
they might have to think about this.
Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection
are operating in an atmosphere
where it's as if they don't have any protection,
and they don't know what to do.
that didn't have copyright protection,
I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,
so I made one.
These are the two main
sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.
It is more complex than this, but this will do.
First: Is something an artistic object?
Then it deserves protection.
Is it a utilitarian object?
Then no, it does not deserve protection.
This is a difficult, unstable binary.
Is it something that needs to
freely circulate in a free society?
No protection.
Or is it a physically fixed
expression of an idea:
something that somebody made
and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?
The problem is that digital technology
has completely subverted the logic
of this physically fixed, expression
versus idea concept.
Nowadays,
we don't really recognize a book
as something that sits on our shelf
or music as something that is
a physical object that we can hold.
It's a digital file.
It is barely tethered to any sort of
physical reality in our minds.
And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,
actually circulate within our culture
a lot more like ideas
than like physically instantiated objects.
when you talk about creativity
and ownership
and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.
They're smart.
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.
He's smart, he's smart.
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people
hashing this out,
trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,
in a digital world,
that's going to lead to the most innovation?
And my suggestion is that
fashion might be a really good place
to start looking for a model
for creative industries in the future.
please visit our website: it's ReadyToShare.org.
And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui
for making this very fashionable presentation.
We're here today to announce
the first synthetic cell,
a cell made by
starting with the digital code in the computer,
building the chromosome
from four bottles of chemicals,
assembling that chromosome in yeast,
transplanting it into
a recipient bacterial cell
and transforming that cell
into a new bacterial species.
So this is the first self-replicating species
that we've had on the planet
whose parent is a computer.
It also is the first species
to have its own website
encoded in its genetic code.
But we'll talk more about
the watermarks in a minute.
15 years ago
when our team then --
we called the institute TIGR --
was involved in sequencing
the first two genomes in history.
We did Haemophilus influenzae
and then the smallest genome of a self-replicating organism,
that of Mycoplasma genitalium.
And as soon as
we had these two sequences
we thought, if this is supposed to be the smallest genome
of a self-replicating species,
could there be even a smaller genome?
Could we understand the basis of cellular life
at the genetic level?
It's been a 15-year quest
just to get to the starting point now
to be able to answer those questions,
because it's very difficult to eliminate
multiple genes from a cell.
You can only do them one at a time.
We decided early on
that we had to take a synthetic route,
even though nobody had been there before,
to see if we could synthesize
a bacterial chromosome
so we could actually vary the gene content
to understand the essential genes for life.
That started our 15-year quest
to get here.
we actually asked
Art Caplan's team at the University of Pennsylvania
to undertake a review
of what the risks, the challenges,
the ethics around creating new
species in the laboratory were
because it hadn't been done before.
They spent about two years
reviewing that independently
and published their results in Science in 1999.
Ham and I took two years off
as a side project to sequence the human genome,
but as soon as that was done
we got back to the task at hand.
a new institute,
the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives,
where we set out two goals:
One, to understand
the impact of our technology on the environment,
and how to understand the environment better,
and two, to start down this process
of making synthetic life
to understand basic life.
In 2003,
we published our first success.
So Ham Smith and Clyde Hutchison
developed some new methods
for making error-free DNA
at a small level.
Our first task was
a 5,000-letter code bacteriophage,
a virus that attacks only E. coli.
So that was
the phage phi X 174,
which was chosen for historical reasons.
It was the first DNA phage,
DNA virus, DNA genome
that was actually sequenced.
So once we realized
that we could make 5,000-base pair
viral-sized pieces,
we thought, we at least have the means
then to try and make serially lots of these pieces
to be able to eventually assemble them together
to make this mega base chromosome.
So, substantially larger than
we even thought we would go initially.
We had to solve the chemistry
for making large DNA molecules,
and we had to solve the biological side
of how, if we had this new chemical entity,
how would we boot it up, activate it
in a recipient cell.
We had two teams working in parallel:
one team on the chemistry,
and the other on trying to
be able to transplant
entire chromosomes
to get new cells.
When we started this out, we thought the synthesis would be the biggest problem,
which is why we chose the smallest genome.
to a much larger one.
And we can walk through the reasons for that,
but basically the small cell
took on the order of
one to two months to get results from,
whereas the larger, faster-growing cell
takes only two days.
So there's only so many cycles we could go through
in a year at six weeks per cycle.
And you should know that basically
99, probably 99 percent plus
of our experiments failed.
So this was a debugging,
problem-solving scenario from the beginning
because there was no recipe
of how to get there.
was in 2007.
Carole Lartigue led the effort
to actually transplant a bacterial chromosome
from one bacteria to another.
I think philosophically, that was one of the most important papers
that we've ever done
because it showed how dynamic life was.
And we knew, once that worked,
that we actually had a chance
if we could make the synthetic chromosomes
to do the same with those.
We didn't know that it was going to take us
several years more to get there.
we reported the complete synthesis
of the Mycoplasma genitalium genome,
a little over 500,000 letters of genetic code,
but we have not yet succeeded in booting up that chromosome.
We think in part, because of its slow growth
and, in part,
cells have all kinds of unique defense mechanisms
to keep these events from happening.
It turned out the cell that we were trying to transplant into
had a nuclease, an enzyme that chews up DNA on its surface,
and was happy to eat
the synthetic DNA that we gave it
and never got transplantations.
But at the time, that was the largest
molecule of a defined structure
that had been made.
but part of the synthesis
had to be accomplished or was able to be accomplished
using yeast, putting the fragments in yeast
and yeast would assemble these for us.
It's an amazing step forward,
but we had a problem because now we had
the bacterial chromosomes growing in yeast.
So in addition to doing the transplant,
we had to find out how to get a bacterial chromosome
out of the eukaryotic yeast
into a form where we could transplant it
into a recipient cell.
for actually growing, cloning
entire bacterial chromosomes in yeast.
So we took the same mycoides genome
that Carole had initially transplanted,
and we grew that in yeast
as an artificial chromosome.
And we thought this would be a great test bed
for learning how to get chromosomes out of yeast
and transplant them.
When we did these experiments, though,
we could get the chromosome out of yeast
but it wouldn't transplant and boot up a cell.
That little issue took the team two years to solve.
was actually methylated,
and the methylation protects it from the restriction enzyme,
from digesting the DNA.
So what we found is if we took the chromosome
out of yeast and methylated it,
we could then transplant it.
Further advances came
when the team removed the restriction enzyme genes
from the recipient capricolum cell.
And once we had done that, now we can take
naked DNA out of yeast and transplant it.
when we published the results of that work in Science,
we all became overconfident
and were sure we were only
a few weeks away
from being able to now boot up
a chromosome out of yeast.
Because of the problems with
Mycoplasma genitalium and its slow growth
about a year and a half ago,
we decided to synthesize
the much larger chromosome, the mycoides chromosome,
knowing that we had the biology worked out on that
for transplantation.
And Dan led the team for the synthesis
of this over one-million-base pair chromosome.
But it turned out it wasn't going to be as simple in the end,
and it set us back three months
because we had one error
out of over a million base pairs in that sequence.
where we could test each synthetic fragment
to see if it would grow in a background
of wild type DNA.
And we found that 10 out of the 11
100,000-base pair pieces we synthesized
were completely accurate
and compatible with
a life-forming sequence.
We narrowed it down to one fragment;
we sequenced it
and found just one base pair had been deleted
in an essential gene.
So accuracy is essential.
There's parts of the genome
where it cannot tolerate even a single error,
and then there's parts of the genome
where we can put in large blocks of DNA,
as we did with the watermarks,
and it can tolerate all kinds of errors.
So it took about three months to find that error
and repair it.
And then early one morning, at 6 a.m.
we got a text from Dan
saying that, now, the first blue colonies existed.
15 years from the beginning.
We felt
one of the tenets of this field
was to make absolutely certain
we could distinguish synthetic DNA
from natural DNA.
Early on, when you're working in a new area of science,
you have to think about all the pitfalls
and things that could lead you
to believe that you had done something when you hadn't,
and, even worse, leading others to believe it.
So, we thought the worst problem would be
a single molecule contamination
of the native chromosome,
leading us to believe that we actually had
created a synthetic cell,
when it would have been just a contaminant.
of putting in watermarks in the DNA
to absolutely make clear
that the DNA was synthetic.
And the first chromosome we built
in 2008 --
the 500,000-base pair one --
we simply assigned
the names of the authors of the chromosome
into the genetic code,
but it was using just amino acid
single letter translations,
which leaves out certain letters of the alphabet.
So the team actually developed a new code
within the code within the code.
So it's a new code
for interpreting and writing messages in DNA.
Now, mathematicians have been hiding and writing
messages in the genetic code for a long time,
but it's clear they were mathematicians and not biologists
because, if you write long messages
with the code that the mathematicians developed,
it would more than likely lead to
new proteins being synthesized
with unknown functions.
actually puts frequent stop codons,
so it's a different alphabet
but allows us to use
the entire English alphabet
with punctuation and numbers.
So, there are four major watermarks
all over 1,000 base pairs of genetic code.
The first one actually contains within it
this code for interpreting
the rest of the genetic code.
So in the remaining information,
in the watermarks,
contain the names of, I think it's
46 different authors
and key contributors
to getting the project to this stage.
And we also built in
a website address
so that if somebody decodes the code
within the code within the code,
they can send an email to that address.
So it's clearly distinguishable
from any other species,
having 46 names in it,
its own web address.
And we added three quotations,
because with the first genome
we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound
than just signing the work.
but we will give the three quotations.
The first is,
"To live, to err,
to fall, to triumph
and to recreate life out of life."
It's a James Joyce quote.
The second quotation is, "See things not as they are,
but as they might be."
It's a quote from the "American Prometheus"
book on Robert Oppenheimer.
And the last one is a Richard Feynman quote:
"What I cannot build,
I cannot understand."
So, because this is as much a philosophical advance
as a technical advance in science,
we tried to deal with both the philosophical
and the technical side.
is that the extensive work
that we've done --
asking for ethical review,
pushing the envelope
on that side as well as the technical side --
this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community,
in the policy community
and at the highest levels of the federal government.
Even with this announcement,
as we did in 2003 --
that work was funded by the Department of Energy,
so the work was reviewed
at the level of the White House,
trying to decide whether to classify the work or publish it.
And they came down on the side of open publication,
which is the right approach --
we've briefed the White House,
we've briefed members of Congress,
we've tried to take and push
the policy issues
in parallel with the scientific advances.
to open it first to the floor for questions.
Yes, in the back.
how significant a breakthrough this is please?
I'm not sure we're the ones that should be explaining how significant it is.
It's significant to us.
Perhaps it's a giant philosophical change
in how we view life.
We actually view it as a baby step in terms of,
it's taken us 15 years to be able
to do the experiment
we wanted to do 15 years ago
on understanding life at its basic level.
But we actually believe
this is going to be a very powerful set of tools
and we're already starting
in numerous avenues
to use this tool.
ongoing funding now from NIH
in a program with Novartis
to try and use these new
synthetic DNA tools
to perhaps make the flu vaccine
that you might get next year.
Because instead of taking weeks to months to make these,
Dan's team can now make these
in less than 24 hours.
So when you see how long it took to get an H1N1 vaccine out,
we think we can shorten that process
quite substantially.
In the vaccine area,
Synthetic Genomics and the Institute
are forming a new vaccine company
because we think these tools can affect vaccines
to diseases that haven't been possible to date,
things where the viruses rapidly evolve,
such with rhinovirus.
Wouldn't it be nice to have something that actually blocked common colds?
Or, more importantly, HIV,
where the virus evolves so quickly
the vaccines that are made today
can't keep up
with those evolutionary changes.
we've been working
on major environmental issues.
I think this latest oil spill in the Gulf
is a reminder.
We can't see CO2 --
we depend on scientific measurements for it
and we see the beginning results
of having too much of it --
but we can see pre-CO2 now
floating on the waters
and contaminating the beaches in the Gulf.
We need some alternatives
for oil.
We have a program with Exxon Mobile
to try and develop new strains of algae
that can efficiently capture carbon dioxide
from the atmosphere or from concentrated sources,
make new hydrocarbons that can go into their refineries
to make normal gasoline
and diesel fuel out of CO2.
and directions that we're taking.
For the next few minutes we're going to talk about energy,
and it's going to be a bit of a varied talk.
I'll try to spin a story about energy,
and oil's a convenient starting place.
The talk will be broadly about energy,
but oil's a good place to start.
And one of the reasons is this is remarkable stuff.
You take about eight or so carbon atoms,
about 20 hydrogen atoms,
you put them together in exactly the right way
and you get this marvelous liquid:
very energy-dense and very easy to refine
into a number of very useful products and fuels.
It's great stuff.
Now, as far as it goes,
there's a lot of oil out there in the world.
of where it's all located.
A bigger one for you to look at.
But this is it, this is the oil in the world.
Geologists have a pretty good idea of where the oil is.
This is about 100 trillion gallons
of crude oil
still to be developed and produced in the world today.
Now, that's just one story about oil,
and we could end it there and say,
"Well, oil's going to last forever
because, well, there's just a lot of it."
But there's actually more to the story than that.
Oh, by the way, if you think you're very far from some of this oil,
1000 meters below where you're all sitting
is one of the largest producing oil fields in the world.
Come talk to me about it, I'll fill in some of the details if you want.
But what about oil? Where is it in the energy system?
Here's a little snapshot of 150 years of oil,
and it's been a dominant part of our energy system
for most of those 150 years.
Now, here's another little secret I'm going to tell you about:
For the last 25 years,
oil has been playing less and less of a role
in global energy systems.
There was one kind of peak oil in 1985,
when oil represented 50 percent of global energy supply.
Now, it's about 35 percent.
It's been declining
and I believe it will continue to decline.
Gasoline consumption in the U.S. probably peaked in 2007
and is declining.
every year.
And so, 25 years ago,
there was a peak oil;
just like, in the 1920s,
there was a peak coal;
and a hundred years before that,
there was a peak wood.
This is a very important picture of the evolution of energy systems.
And what's been taking up the slack in the last few decades?
Well, a lot of natural gas
and a little bit of nuclear, for starters.
And what goes on in the future?
Well, I think out ahead of us a few decades
is peak gas,
and beyond that,
peak renewables.
story about this picture.
Now, I'm not pretending that energy use in total
isn't increasing, it is --
that's another part of the story. Come talk to me about it,
we'll fill in some of the details --
but there's a very important message here:
This is 200 years of history,
and for 200 years we've been systematically decarbonizing
our energy system.
Energy systems of the world
becoming progressively -- year on year,
decade on decade, century on century --
becoming less carbon intense.
And that continues into the future
with the renewables that we're developing today,
reaching maybe 30 percent of primary energy
by mid century.
Now that might be the end of the story --
Okay, we just replace it all with conventional renewables --
but I think, actually, there's more to the story than that.
and this is looking out say 2100 and beyond.
What is the future
of truly sustainable, carbon-free energy?
Well, we have to take a little excursion,
and we'll start in central Texas.
Here's a piece of limestone.
I picked it up outside of Marble Falls, Texas.
It's about 400 million years old.
And it's just limestone, nothing really special about it.
Now, here's a piece of chalk.
I picked this up at MIT. It's a little younger.
And it's different than this limestone, you can see that.
You wouldn't build a building out of this stuff,
and you wouldn't try to give a lecture and write on the chalkboard with this.
Yeah, it's very different -- no, it's not different.
It's not different, it's the same stuff:
calcium carbonate, calcium carbonate.
What's different is how the molecules are put together.
the story gets really neat right now.
Off the coast of California comes this:
It's an abalone shell.
Now, millions of abalone every year
make this shell.
Oh, by the way, just in case you weren't already guessing,
it's calcium carbonate.
It's the same stuff as this
and the same stuff as this.
But it's not the same stuff; it's different.
It's thousands of times,
maybe 3,000 times tougher than this.
And why? Because the lowly abalone
is able to lay down
the calcium carbonate crystals in layers,
making this beautiful, iridescent
mother of pearl.
Very specialized material
that the abalone self-assembles,
millions of abalone,
all the time, every day, every year.
This is pretty incredible stuff.
All the same, what's different?
How the molecules are put together.
Here's a piece of coal.
And I'll suggest that this coal
is about as exciting
as this chalk.
Now, whether we're talking about fuels
or energy carriers,
or perhaps novel materials for batteries
or fuel cells,
nature hasn't ever built those perfect materials yet
because nature didn't need to.
Nature didn't need to because, unlike the abalone shell,
the survival of a species didn't depend
on building those materials,
until maybe now when it might just matter.
So, when we think about the future of energy,
imagine
what would it be like
if instead of this,
we could build the energy equivalent of this
just by rearranging the molecules differently.
The oil will never run out.
It's not because we have a lot of it.
It's not because we're going to build a bajillion windmills.
It's because, well,
thousands of years ago,
people invented ideas --
they had ideas, innovations, technology --
and the Stone Age ended,
not because we ran out of stones.
(Laughter)
It's ideas, it's innovation, it's technology
that will end the age of oil, long before we run out of oil.
I want to talk about penguins today.
But first, I want to start by saying that
we need a new operating system,
for the oceans and for the Earth.
When I came to the Galapagos 40 years ago,
there were 3,000 people
that lived in the Galapagos.
Now there are over 30,000.
There were two Jeeps on Santa Cruz.
Now, there are around a thousand trucks
and buses and cars there.
So the fundamental problems that we face
are overconsumption and too many people.
It's the same problems in the Galapagos,
except, obviously,
it's worse here, in some ways, than other places.
Because we've only doubled the population of the Earth
since the 1960s -- a little more than doubled --
but we have 6.7 billion people in the world,
and we all like to consume.
And one of the major problems that we have
is our operating system
is not giving us the proper feedback.
We're not paying the true
environmental costs of our actions.
let me just say, that I had never
camped before.
I had never lived alone
for any period of time,
and I'd never slept with sea lions
snoring next to me all night.
But moreover, I'd never lived on an uninhabited island.
Punta Espinosa is where I lived for over a year,
and we call it uninhabited
because there are no people there.
But it's alive with life;
it's hardly uninhabited.
So a lot has happened in the last 40 years,
is the importance of wild places, wild things,
certainly wildlife,
and the amazing qualities that penguins have.
Penguins are real athletes:
They can swim 173 kilometers in a day.
They can swim at the same speed day and night --
that's faster than any Olympic swimmer.
I mean, they can do like seven kilometers an hour
and sustain it.
But what is really amazing, because of this deepness here,
Emperor penguins can go down
more than 500 meters
and they can hold their breath for 23 minutes.
Magellanic penguins, the ones that I work on,
they can dive to about 90 meters
and they can stay down for
about 4.6 minutes.
Humans, without fins: 90 meters, 3.5 minutes.
And I doubt anybody in this room
could really hold their breath for 3.5 minutes.
You have to train to be able to do that.
So penguins are amazing athletes.
that really doesn't say that they like penguins.
They're comical, they walk upright,
and, of course, they're diligent.
And, more importantly, they're well-dressed.
So they have all the criteria
that people normally like.
But scientifically, they're amazing because they're sentinels.
They tell us about our world in a lot of different ways,
and particularly the ocean.
that's on the front of a little zodiac here in the Galapagos.
And that's what I came to study.
I thought I was going to study the social behavior of Galapagos penguins,
but you already know
penguins are rare.
These are the rarest penguins in the world.
Why I thought I was going to be able to do that, I don't know.
But the population has changed
dramatically since I was first here.
When I counted penguins for the first time
and tried to do a census,
we just counted all the individual beaks that we could
around all these islands.
We counted around 2,000, so I don't know how many penguins there really are,
but I know I can count 2,000.
If you go and do it now, the national parks
count about 500.
So we have a quarter of the penguins
that we did 40 years ago.
And this is true of most of our living systems.
We have less than we had before,
and most of them are in fairly steep decline.
And I want to just show you a little bit about why.
to tell you that
it's important to pay attention to penguins.
Most important of all,
I didn't know what that was the first time I heard it.
And you can imagine sleeping on Fernandina your first night there
and you hear this lonesome, plaintful call.
I fell in love with penguins,
and it certainly has changed the rest of my life.
What I found out I was studying
is really the difference in how the Galapagos changes,
the most extreme variation.
You've heard about these El Ninos,
but this is the extreme that penguins all over the world
have to adapt to.
This is a cold-water event
called La Nina.
Where it's blue and it's green, it means the water is really cold.
And so you can see this current coming up --
in this case, the Humboldt Current --
that comes all the way out to the Galapagos Islands,
and this deep undersea current, the Cromwell Current,
that upwells around the Galapagos.
That brings all the nutrients:
When this is cold in the Galapagos,
it's rich, and there's plenty of food for everyone.
you see all this red,
and you see no green
out here around the Galapagos.
That means that there's no upwelling,
and there's basically no food.
So it's a real desert
for not only for the penguins and the sea lions and the marine iguanas ...
things die when there's no food.
But we didn't even know that that
affected the Galapagos when I went to study penguins.
And you can imagine being on an island hoping you're going to see penguins,
and you're in the middle of an El Nino event
and there are no penguins.
They're not breeding; they're not even around.
I studied marine iguanas at that point.
But this is a global phenomenon, we know that.
at a place called Punta Tombo --
the largest Magellanic penguin colony in the world
down here about 44 degrees south latitude --
you see that there's great variation here.
Some years, the cold water
goes all the way up to Brazil,
and other years, in these La Nina years, it doesn't.
So the oceans don't always act together; they act differently,
but that is the kind of variation
that penguins have to live with,
and it's not easy.
So when I went to study the Magellanic penguins,
I didn't have any problems.
There were plenty of them.
showing all the penguins along the beach.
I went there because the Japanese wanted to start harvesting them
and turning them into high fashion golf gloves,
protein and oil.
Fortunately, nobody has harvested any penguins
and we're getting over 100,000 tourists a year to see them.
But the population is declining
and it's declined fairly substantially, about 21 percent
since 1987, when I started these surveys,
in terms of number of active nests.
Here, you can see where Punta Tombo is,
and they breed in incredibly dense colonies.
We know this because of long-term science,
because we have long-term studies there.
And science is important in informing decision makers,
and also in changing how we do
and knowing the direction of change that we're going in.
has funded me along with a lot of individuals
over the last 27 years
to be able to produce these kinds of maps.
And also, we know that it's not only
Galapagos penguins that are in trouble,
but Magellanics and many other species of penguins.
And so we have started a global penguin society
to try to focus on the real plight of penguins.
This is one of the plights of penguins: oil pollution.
Penguins don't like oil
and they don't like to swim through oil.
The nice thing is, if you look down here in Argentina,
there's no surface oil pollution from this composite map.
But, in fact, when we went to Argentina,
penguins were often found
totally covered in oil.
So they were just minding their own business.
They ended up swimming through ballast water that had oil in it.
Because when tankers carry oil
they have to have ballast at some point,
so when they're empty, they have the ballast water in there.
When they come back, they actually dump
this oily ballast water into the ocean.
Why do they do that? Because it's cheaper,
because they don't pay the real environmental costs.
We usually don't, and we want to start
getting the accounting system right
so we can pay the real cost.
You can't find oiled penguins in Argentina.
We have laws,
and we can't have illegal dumping; it's against the law."
So we ended up spending nine years
convincing the government that there were lots of oiled penguins.
In some years, like this year, we found
more than 80 percent
of the adult penguins dead on the beach
were covered in oil.
These little blue dots are the fledglings --
we do this survey every March --
which means that they're only in the environment
from January until March,
so maybe three months at the most
that they could get covered in oil.
And you can see, in some years over 60 percent
of the fledglings were oiled.
and, amazingly, they changed their laws.
They moved the tanker lanes
40 kilometers farther off shore,
and people are not doing as much illegal dumping.
So what we're seeing now
is very few penguins are oiled.
Why are there even these penguins oiled?
Because we've solved the problem in Chubut province,
which is like a state in Argentina
where Punta Tombo is --
so that's about 1,000 kilometers of coastline --
but we haven't solved the problem
in northern Argentina, Uruguay and Brazil.
So now I want to show you that penguins are affected.
This is climate change. Now this has really been a fun study
because I put satellite tags on the back
of these Magellanic penguins.
Try to convince donors to give you a couple thousand dollars
to glue a satellite tag on the back of penguins.
But we've been doing this now for more than a decade to learn where they go.
We thought we needed a marine protected area
of about 30 kilometers,
and then we put a satellite tag on the back of a penguin.
And what the penguins show us --
and these are all the little dots
from where the penguins' positions were
for penguins in incubation in 2003 --
and what you see is some of these individuals
are going 800 kilometers away from their nests.
So that means as their mate
is sitting on the nest incubating the eggs,
the other one is out there foraging,
and the longer they have to stay gone,
the worse condition the mate is in when the mate comes back.
And, of course, all of this then leads to a vicious cycle
and you can't raise a lot of chicks.
these are all the dots of where the penguins are --
they were raising a little over
a half of a chick.
Here, you can see in 2006,
they raised almost three quarters
of a chick per nest,
and you can see that they're closer to Punta Tombo;
they're not going as far away.
This past year, in 2009,
you can see that they're now raising
about a fourth of a chick,
and some of these individuals are going
more than 900 kilometers away from their nests.
So it's kind of like you having a job in Chicago,
and then you get transferred
to St. Louis,
and your mate is not happy about this
because you've got to pay airfare,
because you're gone longer.
The same thing's true for penguins as well.
And they're going about, on average now,
40 kilometers farther than they did a decade ago.
And so we started a publication
with the Society for Conservation
that we think presents cutting-edge science
in a new, novel way,
because we have reporters that are good writers
that actually can distill the information
and make it accessible to the general public.
So if you're interested in cutting-edge science
and smarter conservation,
you should join with our 11 partners --
some of them here in this room, like the Nature Conservancy --
and look at this magazine
because we need to get information out about conservation
to the general public.
all of you, probably,
have had some relationship at some time in your life
with a dog, a cat, some sort of pet,
and you recognized that those are individuals.
And some of you consider them almost part of your family.
If you had a relationship with a penguin,
you'd see it in the same sort of way.
They're amazing creatures
that really change how you view the world
because they're not that different from us:
They're trying to make a living,
they're trying to raise their offspring,
they're trying to get on and survive in the world.
Turbo's never been fed.
He met us and got his name
because he started standing under
my diesel truck: a turbo truck,
so we named him Turbo.
Turbo has taken to knocking on the door with his beak,
we let him in and he comes in here.
And I just wanted to show you
what happened one day
when Turbo brought in a friend.
So this is Turbo.
He's coming up to one of my graduate students and flipper patting,
which he would do to a female penguin.
And you can see, he's not trying to bite.
This guy has never been in before
and he's trying to figure out, "What is going on?
What is this guy doing?
This is really pretty weird."
And you'll see soon
that my graduate student ...
and you see, Turbo's pretty intent
on his flipper patting.
And now he's looking at the other guy,
saying, "You are really weird."
And now look at this: not friendly.
So penguins really differ in their personalities
just like our dogs and our cats.
and become more technologically literate.
So we're trying to put that
in computers in the field.
And penguins are always involved in helping us
or not helping us in one way or another.
This is a radio frequency ID system.
You put a little piece of rice in the foot of a penguin
that has a barcode, so it tells you who it is.
It walks over the pad, and you know who it is.
See, this one's coming back to its nest.
They're all coming in at this time,
walking across there, just kind of leisurely coming in.
Here's a female that's in a hurry. She's got food.
She's really rushing back, because it's hot,
to try to feed her chicks.
And then there's another fellow that will leisurely come by.
Look how fat he is. He's walking back to feed his chicks.
Then I realize that they're playing
king of the box.
This is my box up here, and this is the system that works.
You can see this penguin, he goes over, he looks at those wires,
does not like that wire.
He unplugs the wire; we have no data.
OK.
Most important thing is:
Only you can change yourself,
and only you can change the world
and make it better, for people
as well as penguins.
Good afternoon.
There's a medical revolution happening all around us,
and it's one that's going to help us conquer
some of society's most dreaded conditions,
including cancer.
The revolution is called angiogenesis,
and it's based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels.
Well, the human body is literally packed with them --
60,000 miles worth in a typical adult.
End to end, that would form a line that would circle the earth twice.
The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.
We've got 19 billion of them in our bodies.
And these are the vessels of life,
and as I'll show you, they can also be the vessels of death.
Now, the remarkable thing about blood vessels
is that they have this ability
in the lungs, they line air sacs for gas exchange.
In muscle, they corkscrew,
so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation.
And in nerves, they course along like power lines,
keeping those nerves alive.
when we're actually still in the womb.
And what that means is that as adults,
blood vessels don't normally grow.
Except in a few special circumstances.
In women, blood vessels grow every month,
to build the lining of the uterus.
During pregnancy, they form the placenta,
which connects mom and baby.
And after injury, blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab
in order to heal a wound.
And this is actually what it looks like,
hundreds of blood vessels, all growing toward the center of the wound.
the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time.
It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances,
stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis,
such that, when we need a brief burst of blood vessels,
the body can do this by releasing stimulators,
proteins called angiogenic factors,
that act as natural fertilizer, and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout.
When those excess vessels are no longer needed,
the body prunes them back to baseline,
using naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
There are other situations where we start beneath the baseline,
and we need to grow more blood vessels, just to get back to normal levels --
for example, after an injury --
that set point.
there are defects in the system,
where the body can't prune back extra blood vessels,
or can't grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time.
And in these situations, angiogenesis is out of balance.
And when angiogenesis is out of balance,
a myriad of diseases result.
For example, insufficient angiogenesis -- not enough blood vessels --
leads to wounds that don't heal, heart attacks,
legs without circulation, death from stroke,
nerve damage.
And on the other end, excessive angiogenesis --
too many blood vessels -- drives disease,
and we see this in cancer, blindness,
arthritis, obesity, Alzheimer's disease.
In total, there are more than 70 major diseases
affecting more than a billion people worldwide,
that all look on the surface to be different from one another,
And this realization is allowing us to re-conceptualize
the way that we actually approach these diseases,
by controlling angiogenesis.
because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer --
every type of cancer.
So here we go.
This is a tumor: dark, gray, ominous mass growing inside a brain.
And under the microscope,
you can see hundreds of these brown-stained blood vessels,
capillaries that are feeding cancer cells,
bringing oxygen and nutrients.
But cancers don't start out like this,
and in fact, cancers don't start out with a blood supply.
They start out as small, microscopic nests of cells,
that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size.
That's the tip of a ballpoint pen.
Then they can't get any larger because they don't have a blood supply,
so they don't have enough oxygen or nutrients.
all the time in our body.
Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents
have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50
actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts.
About 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s
have microscopic prostate cancers,
and virtually 100 percent of us, by the time we reach our 70s,
will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid.
Yet, without a blood supply,
most of these cancers will never become dangerous.
Dr. Judah Folkman, who was my mentor
and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field,
once called this "cancer without disease."
when it's working properly,
prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers.
And this turns out to be
one of our most important defense mechanisms
against cancer.
In fact, if you actually block angiogenesis
and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells,
tumors simply can't grow up.
But once angiogenesis occurs,
cancers can grow exponentially.
And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless,
to being deadly.
Cancer cells mutate,
and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors,
natural fertilizer,
that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer.
And once those vessels invade the cancer,
it can expand, it can invade local tissues,
and the same vessels that are feeding tumors
when angiogenesis is already turned on,
and cancer cells are growing like wild.
between a harmless cancer and a harmful one,
then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution
is a new approach to treating cancer
by cutting off the blood supply.
We call this antiangiogenic therapy,
and it's completely different from chemotherapy,
because it selectively aims
at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers.
we see in other places of the body --
they're abnormal, they're very poorly constructed,
and because of that, they're highly vulnerable
to treatments that target them.
In effect, when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy --
here, an experimental drug for a glioma,
which is a type of brain tumor --
you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur
when the tumor is being starved.
Here's a woman with a breast cancer,
being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin,
which is FDA approved.
And you can see that the halo of blood flow
disappears after treatment.
that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy.
So a few years ago, I asked myself,
"Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers,
even in other species?"
So here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo,
who had a very aggressive tumor
called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder.
It invaded into his lungs.
His veterinarian only gave him three months to live.
So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs
that could be mixed into his dog food,
as well as an antiangiogenic cream,
that could be applied on the surface of the tumor.
And within a few weeks of treatment,
we were able to slow down that cancer's growth,
such that we were ultimately able to extend Milo’s survival
to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted,
all with a very good quality of life.
And we've subsequently treated more than 600 dogs.
We have about a 60 percent response rate,
and improved survival for these pets
that were about to be euthanized.
This is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida,
and she had these lesions in her mouth
that, over the course of three years,
developed into invasive squamous cell cancers.
So we created an antiangiogenic paste.
We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week.
And over the course of seven months,
the cancers completely disappeared,
and the biopsies came back as normal.
of a Quarter Horse named Guinness.
It's a very, very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma.
It had already spread to his lymph nodes,
And over the course of six months,
he experienced a complete remission.
And here he is six years later,
Guinness, with his very happy owner.
And in fact, the first pioneering treatments
for people as well as dogs,
are already becoming available.
There are 12 different drugs, 11 different cancer types.
But the real question is:
How well do these work in practice?
So here's actually the patient survival data
from eight different types of cancer.
The bars represent survival time
taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy,
or surgery, or radiation available.
But starting in 2004,
when antiangiogenic therapies first became available,
you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival
for people with kidney cancer, multiple myeloma,
colorectal cancer, and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.
That's impressive.
But for other tumors and cancer types,
the improvements have only been modest.
"Why haven't we been able to do better?"
And the answer, to me, is obvious:
we're treating cancer too late in the game,
when it's already established,
and oftentimes, it's already spread or metastasized.
And as a doctor,
I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage,
achieving a cure can be difficult, if not impossible.
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis, and started thinking:
Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis,
This could help healthy people,
as well as people who've already beaten cancer once or twice,
and want to find a way to keep it from coming back.
I went back to look at cancer's causes.
And what really intrigued me,
was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent
of environmentally-caused cancers.
But I actually took a completely opposite approach,
and began asking: What could we be adding to our diet
that's naturally antiangiogenic,
and that could boost the body's defense system,
and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers?
In other words, can we eat to starve cancer?
And our search for this has taken us to the market,
the farm and to the spice cabinet,
because what we've discovered
is that Mother Nature has laced a large number
of foods and beverages and herbs
with naturally-occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis.
And we can use this system to test dietary factors
at concentrations that are obtainable by eating.
Let me show you what happens
when we put in an extract from red grapes.
The active ingredient is resveratrol,
it's also found in red wine.
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis,
by 60 percent.
Here's what happens when we added an extract from strawberries.
It potently inhibits angiogenesis.
And extract from soybeans.
And here is a growing list
of antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we're interested in studying.
For each food type,
we believe that there are different potencies
within different strains and varietals.
And we want to measure this because,
well, while you're eating a strawberry
or drinking tea,
why not select the one that's most potent
for preventing cancer?
They're all common ones: Chinese jasmine, Japanese sencha,
Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared,
and you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency,
from less potent to more potent.
But what's very cool
is when we combine the two less potent teas together,
the combination, the blend, is more potent than either one alone.
This means there's food synergy.
the less angiogenesis -- that's good.
And here are some common drugs
that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people.
Statins, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs,
and a few others -- they inhibit angiogenesis, too.
And here are the dietary factors
going head-to-head against these drugs.
You can see they clearly hold their own,
and in some cases, they're more potent than the actual drugs.
Soy, parsley, garlic, grapes, berries.
Imagine if we could create the world's first rating system,
in which we could score foods
according to their antiangiogenic, cancer-preventative properties.
And that's what we're doing right now.
and so the real question is:
What is the evidence in people
that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer?
Well, the best example I know
is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years,
in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes
two to three times a week,
had up to a 50 percent reduction
in their risk of developing prostate cancer.
Now, we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene,
and lycopene is antiangiogenic.
But what's even more interesting from this study,
is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer,
those who ate more servings of tomato sauce,
actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer.
So this human study is a prime example
can have an impact on cancer.
And we're now studying the role of a healthy diet --
with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University --
the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis
that we can find in the bloodstream.
even beyond cancer research.
Because if we're right, it could impact consumer education,
food services, public health
and even the insurance industry.
And in fact, some insurance companies
are already beginning to think along these lines.
Check out this ad from BlueCross BlueShield of Minnesota.
For many people around the world,
dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution,
based on local, sustainable, antiangiogenic crops.
I've talked to you about food,
and I've talked to you about cancer,
so there's just one more disease that I have to tell you about,
and that's obesity.
Because it turns out that adipose tissue -- fat --
is highly angiogenesis-dependent.
And like a tumor, fat grows when blood vessels grow.
So the question is:
The top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse
that eats nonstop until it turns fat,
like this furry tennis ball.
and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor, it loses weight.
Stop the treatment, gains the weight back. Restart the treatment, loses the weight.
Stop the treatment, it gains the weight back.
And, in fact, you can cycle the weight up and down
simply by inhibiting angiogenesis.
So this approach that we're taking for cancer prevention
may also have an application for obesity.
The truly interesting thing about this
is that we can't take these obese mice
and make them lose more weight
than what the normal mouse's weight is supposed to be.
In other words, we can't create supermodel mice.
"Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen,
and thinking what no one has thought."
that for diseases like cancer, obesity and other conditions,
there may be a great power
in attacking their common denominator: angiogenesis.
And that's what I think the world needs now.
For anyone out here who has cancer, what would you recommend?
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now, for most cancer patients?
that are FDA approved,
and if you're a cancer patient,
or working for one or advocating for one, you should ask about them.
And there are many clinical trials.
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies,
and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline.
So, consider the approved ones,
look for clinical trials,
but then between what the doctor can do for you,
we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves.
This is one of the themes I'm talking about:
We can empower ourselves
to do the things that doctors can't do for us,
which is to use knowledge and take action.
And if Mother Nature has given us some clues,
we think there might be a new future in the value of how we eat,
and what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day.
for people who might have risk factors for cancer,
would you recommend pursuing any treatments prophylactically,
or simply pursuing the right diet,
with lots of tomato sauce?
it doesn't take long to go to a credible source like PubMed,
the National Library of Medicine,
to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction
based on diet and based on common medications.
And that's certainly something that anybody can look into.
I have a daughter, Mulan.
And when she was eight, last year,
she was doing a report for school
or she had some homework about frogs.
And we were at this restaurant,
and she said, "So, basically,
frogs lay eggs
and the eggs turn into tadpoles,
and tadpoles turn into frogs."
It's the females, I think, that lay the eggs,
and then the males fertilize them.
And then they become tadpoles and frogs."
you know, that you need
to create a new frog
from the mom and dad frog." (Laughter)
I didn't know it would happen so quick, at eight.
I was trying to remember all the guidebooks,
and all I could remember was,
"Only answer the question they're asking.
Don't give any more information." (Laughter)
So I said, "Yes."
where do human women,
like, where do women lay their eggs?"
funny you should ask. (Laughter)
We have evolved to have our own pond.
We have our very own pond inside our bodies.
And we lay our eggs there,
we don't have to worry about other eggs or anything like that.
It's our own pond. And that's how it happens."
Men, through their penis,
they fertilize the eggs by the sperm coming out.
And you go through the woman's vagina."
and she goes, "Mom!
Like, where you go to the bathroom?"
I know."
(Laughter)
That's how we evolved. It does seem odd.
It is a little bit like having a waste treatment plant
right next to an amusement park ...
Bad zoning, but ..." (Laughter)
but men and women can't ever see each other naked, Mom.
So how could that ever happen?"
"Human males and females
develop a special bond,
and when they're much older, much, much older than you,
and they have a very special feeling,
then they can be naked together."
have you done this before?"
Because she knows that I adopted her and that I can't have kids.
Like, how do they know that's the time?
Mom, does the man just say,
'Is now the time to take off my pants?'"
(Laughter)
"That is exactly right.
That's exactly how it happens."
"Mom. What if two just people saw each other on the street,
like a man and a woman, they just started doing it. Would that ever happen?"
Oh ..."
and there was just like a whole bunch of girls and a whole bunch of boys,
and there was a bunch of men and women and they just started doing it, Mom?
Would that ever happen?"
That's not how we do it."
"Mom, how do cats do it?"
I don't understand the legs."
She goes, "Mom, everyone can't do the splits."
and I'm probably like, "The legs get worked out."
and maybe we can see ... like on Wikipedia." (Laughter)
And, unfortunately, on YouTube, there's many cats mating videos.
And we watched them and I'm so thankful,
because she's just like, "Wow! This is so amazing."
She goes, "What about dogs?"
So we put in dogs mating, and,
you know, we're watching it, and she's totally absorbed.
do you think they would have, on the Internet,
any humans mating?"
(Laughter)
And then I realized that
I had taken my little eight year old's hand,
and taken her right into Internet porn. (Laughter)
trusting, loving face,
and I said,
"Oh, no.
That would never happen."
About a year ago,
I asked myself a question:
"Knowing what I know,
why am I not a vegetarian?"
After all, I'm one of the green guys:
I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.
I started a site called TreeHugger --
I care about this stuff.
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day
can increase my risk of dying by a third.
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion
animals we raise each year for meat
are raised in factory farm conditions
that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider
for our own cats, dogs and other pets.
Environmentally, meat, amazingly,
causes more emissions
than all of transportation combined:
cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.
And beef production uses 100 times the water
that most vegetables do.
We as a society
are eating twice as much meat
as we did in the 50s.
So what was once the special little side treat
now is the main, much more regular.
So really, any of these angles
should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk --
tucking into a big old steak.
I realized that what I was being pitched
was a binary solution.
It was either
you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,
and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.
Imagine your last hamburger.
(Laughter)
So my common sense,
my good intentions,
were in conflict with my taste buds.
And I'd commit to doing it later,
and not surprisingly, later never came.
Sound familiar?
might there be a third solution?
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.
It's called weekday veg.
The name says it all:
Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.
On the weekend, your choice.
Simple.
If you want to take it to the next level,
remember, the major culprits
in terms of environmental damage and health
are red and processed meats.
So you want to swap those out
with some good, sustainably harvested fish.
It's structured,
so it ends up being simple to remember,
and it's okay to break it here and there.
After all, cutting five days a week
is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.
My footprint's smaller,
I'm lessening pollution,
I feel better about the animals,
I'm even saving money.
Best of all, I'm healthier,
I know that I'm going to live longer,
and I've even lost a little weight.
for your health,
for your pocketbook,
for the environment, for the animals:
What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?
After all, if all of us
ate half as much meat,
it would be like half of us
were vegetarians.
Can I ask you to please recall a time
when you really loved something --
a movie, an album, a song or a book --
and you recommended it wholeheartedly
to someone you also really liked,
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,
and it came back, and the person hated it?
So, by way of introduction,
that is the exact same state
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)
I teach high school math.
I sell a product to a market
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.
a useful stereotype about you all.
I could give you guys
an algebra-two final exam,
and I would expect no higher
than a 25 percent pass rate.
And both of these facts say less about you or my students
than they do about what we call math education
in the U.S. today.
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.
For example, factoring quadratics with
leading coefficients greater than one.
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,
provided you have a really strong grounding
in reasoning. Math reasoning --
we'll call it the application
of math processes to the world around us --
this is hard to teach.
This is what we would love students to retain,
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won't retain it.
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time
to be a math teacher.
that you're doing math reasoning wrong
in your classroom.
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.
You finish your lecture block
and immediately you have five hands going up
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.
Students lack perseverance.
They lack retention; you find yourself
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.
There's an aversion to word problems,
which describes 99 percent of my students.
And then the other one percent
is eagerly looking for the formula
to apply in that situation.
This is really destructive.
has a really good description for this.
He swore off creating
contemporary drama,
shows set in the present day,
because he saw that when people fill their mind
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,
in such a way that they expect simple problems.
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,
three commercial breaks and a laugh track.
And I'll put it to all of you,
what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.
I am very concerned about this
because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.
I'm doing bad things
to my own future and well-being
when I teach this way.
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning
and patient problem solving,
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.
It applies equally to math.
Notice, first of all here,
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,
each of which will figure into a formula
somewhere, eventually,
which the student will then compute.
I believe in real life.
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,
that was worth solving
where you knew all of the given information in advance;
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,
or you didn't have sufficient information
and had to go find some.
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,
we have problems like this right here
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,
it helpfully explains to you
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.
You could literally, I mean this,
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.
It's about defining steepness and slope
using a ski lift.
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together
and presented to the student all at once,
how that creates this impatient problem solving.
I'll define them here: You have the visual.
You also have the mathematical structure,
talking about grids, measurements, labels,
points, axes, that sort of thing.
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:
which section is the steepest.
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,
but we're paving a smooth, straight path
from one to the other
and congratulating our students for how well
they can step over the small cracks in the way.
That's all we're doing here.
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way
and build them up with students,
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.
and I immediately ask the question:
Which section is the steepest?
And this starts conversation
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.
So you get people arguing against each other,
friend versus friend,
in pairs, journaling, whatever.
And then eventually we realize
it's getting annoying to talk about
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen
or the skier just above the mid line.
And we realize how great would it be
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels
to talk about them more easily.
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.
And then and only then,
we throw down that mathematical structure.
The math serves the conversation,
the conversation doesn't serve the math.
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.
But if you need to,
your students can then develop those substeps together.
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,
who, I believe, has paid his dues.
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,
we just give problems to students;
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.
with my five hours of prep time per week
is to take fairly compelling elements
of problems like this from my textbook
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.
And here's how it works.
I like this question. It's about a water tank.
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.
Students have to develop those,
they have to formulate those.
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.
Students need to decide, "All right, well,
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.
So now we have a water tank.
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,
not in terms of line art or clip art
that you so often see in textbooks,
we go out and we take a picture of it.
So now we have the real deal.
How long will it take it to fill it up?
And then even better is we take a video,
a video of someone filling it up.
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.
It's tedious.
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,
and they're all wondering at some point or another,
"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"
(Laughter)
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?
because, like the intro,
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math
because someone else has the formula;
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,
so I won't talk about it.
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.
Everyone's filled something up with water before,
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated
joining the conversation.
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,
and kids have bought in here.
And then we follow the process I've described.
And the best part here, or one of the better parts
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key
in the back of the teacher's edition.
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.
(Laughter)
And that's terrifying,
because the theoretical models that always work out
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,
that's great, but
it's scary to talk about sources of error
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.
But those conversations have been so valuable,
among the most valuable.
with students who come pre-installed
with these viruses day one of the class.
These are the kids who now, one semester in,
I can put something on the board,
totally new, totally foreign,
and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more
than they would have at the start of the year,
which is just so fun.
We're no longer averse to word problems,
because we've redefined what a word problem is.
We're no longer intimidated by math,
because we're slowly redefining what math is.
This has been a lot of fun.
because it brings the real world into your classroom
in high resolution and full color;
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;
to ask the shortest question you possibly can
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;
to let students build the problem,
because Einstein said so;
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:
It's buying you out of your obligation,
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.
is because we have the tools to create
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,
and the tools to distribute it
freely under open licenses
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"
which, wow.
I put this problem on my blog recently:
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,
the one that has one cart and 19 items
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,
which is just bizarre, right?
that people, not just students,
are really hungry for this.
Math makes sense of the world.
Math is the vocabulary
for your own intuition.
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --
whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --
insist on better math curriculum.
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)
I'm going to tell you two things today:
One is what we have lost,
and two, a way to bring it back.
And let me start with this.
This is my baseline:
This is the Mediterranean coast
with no fish, bare rock
and lots of sea urchins that like to eat the algae.
Something like this is what I first saw
when I jumped in the water for the first time
in the Mediterranean coast off Spain.
Now, if an alien came to earth --
let's call him Joe --
what would Joe see?
If Joe jumped in a coral reef,
there are many things the alien could see.
Very unlikely, Joe would jump
on a pristine coral reef,
a virgin coral reef with lots of coral, sharks, crocodiles,
manatees, groupers,
turtles, etc.
So, probably, what Joe would see
would be in this part, in the greenish part of the picture.
Here we have the extreme with dead corals,
microbial soup and jellyfish.
And where the diver is,
this is probably where most of the reefs of the world are now,
with very few corals, algae overgrowing the corals,
lots of bacteria,
and where the large animals are gone.
because we started modern science
with scuba diving long after
we started degrading marine ecosystems.
and we're going to the left; we're going to go back to the past
to see what the ocean was like.
And let's start with this time machine, the Line Islands,
where we have conducted a series
of National Geographic expeditions.
This sea is an archipelago belonging to Kiribati
that spans across the equator
We didn't see a single shark.
This is the place that Captain Cook discovered in 1777
and he described a huge abundance of sharks
biting the rudders and the oars of their small boats
while they were going ashore.
if this is your baseline.
If we go back to a place
like Palmyra Atoll,
where I was with Jeremy Jackson a few years ago,
You can see sharks in every single dive.
then we get to the places where the corals
This is what we call the biomass pyramid.
If we get all of the fish of a coral reef together and weigh them,
the parrotfish, the surgeonfish that eat the algae.
Then the plankton feeders, these little damselfish,
But this is a consequence.
This view of the world is a consequence
we realized that the natural world
was upside down;
this pyramid was inverted.
The top head does account for most of the biomass,
in some places up to 85 percent,
like Kingman Reef, which is now protected.
like these parrot fish that are like marine goats.
They clean the reef; everything that grows enough to be seen,
they keep the water clean from
during El Nino, year '97, '98,
the water was too warm for too long,
and many corals bleached
where the large animals are gone,
the corals have not recovered.
a big table coral that died and collapsed.
And the fish have grazed the algae,
so the turf of algae is a little lower.
Then you go to Palmyra Atoll
that has more biomass of herbivores,
and the dead corals are clean,
[and] the more complex your food web,
the higher the resilience, [and] the more likely
that the system is going to recover
from the short-term impacts of warming events.
And that's good news, so we need to recover that structure.
We need to make sure that all of the pieces of the ecosystem are there
so the ecosystem can adapt
to the effects of global warming.
especially no-take reserves
that we set aside
to allow for the recovery for marine life.
And let me go back to that image
of the Mediterranean.
This was my baseline. This is what I saw when I was a kid.
And at the same time I was watching
Jacques Cousteau's shows on TV,
with all this richness and abundance and diversity.
And I thought that this richness
belonged to tropical seas,
and that the Mediterranean was a naturally poor sea.
But, little did I know,
fish come back, they eat the urchins,
and then the algae grow again.
So you have this little algal forest,
and in the size of a laptop
you can find more than 100 species of algae,
mostly microscopic fit
hundreds of species of little animals
that then feed the fish,
so that the system recovers.
And this particular place, the Medes Islands Marine Reserve,
20 times more than fishing,
and it represents 88 percent
of all the tourist revenue.
So these places not only help the ecosystem
but also help the people
who can benefit from the ecosystem.
of what no-take reserves do.
These places, when we protect them,
so if you have 1,000 species
The size of organisms increases a third,
so your fish are now this big.
The abundance, how many fish you have per square meter,
increases almost 170 percent.
And the biomass -- this is the most spectacular change --
4.5 times greater biomass
on average, just after five to seven years.
In some places up to 10 times
larger biomass inside the reserves.
inside the reserve that grow, and what do they do?
they grow larger and they reproduce a lot.
And same thing for invertebrates. This is the example.
These are egg cases
you cannot even detect this.
One point three million eggs per square meter
inside the marine reserve where these snails are very abundant.
the little larvae juveniles spill over,
they all spill over,
the more fish you have.
So the fishermen are catching more.
You can see where the limits of the reserve are
because you see the boats lined up.
So there is spill over;
there are benefits beyond the boundaries of these reserves
that help people around them,
while at the same time
the reserve is protecting
the entire habitat. It is building resilience.
or a world without reserves --
is like a debit account
where we withdraw all the time
and we never make any deposit.
Reserves are like savings accounts.
We have this principal that we don't touch;
that produces returns,
social, economic and ecological.
Two examples, again,
of how these reserves can benefit people.
This is how much fishermen get
everyday in Kenya, fishing
over a series of years,
in a place where
But if we add the no-take reserve on top of that,
the fishermen are still making more money
by fishing less around an area that is protected.
Nassau groupers in Belize in the Mesoamerican Reef.
This is grouper sex,
and the groupers aggregate around the full moons
of December and January for a week.
They used to aggregate up to the
tens of thousands, 30,000 groupers about this big
in one hectare, in one aggregation.
Fishermen knew about these things; they caught them, and they depleted them.
When I went there for the first time in 2000,
there were only 3,000 groupers left.
And the fishermen were authorized to catch 30 percent
of the entire spawning population every year.
So we did a simple analysis,
and it doesn't take rocket science
to figure out that, if you take 30 percent every year,
your fishery is going to collapse very quickly.
It happened in many places around the Caribbean.
And they would make 4,000 dollars per year,
total, for the entire fishery,
several fishing boats.
Now, if you do an economic analysis
and project what would happen
if the fish were not cut,
if we brought just 20 divers
one month per year,
the revenue would be more than 20 times higher
If this is so good, if this is such a no-brainer, how much of this do we have?
And you already heard that
less than one percent of the ocean's protected.
We're getting closer to one percent now,
thanks to the protections of the Chagos Archipelago,
and only a fraction of this is fully protected from fishing.
Scientific studies recommend that at least 20 percent
of the ocean should be protected.
The estimated range is between 20 and 50 percent
for a series of goals of biodiversity
and fishery enhancement and resilience.
how much we are paying now
to subsidize fishing:
35 billion dollars per year.
of how much it would cost to create
a network of protected areas
covering 20 percent of the ocean
that would be only a fraction
of what we are now paying;
the government hands out to a fishery
that is collapsing.
People are losing their jobs because the fisheries are collapsing.
A creation of a network of reserves
If it's so clear that these savings accounts
are good for the environment and for people,
why don't we have 20, 50 percent of the ocean?
And how can we reach that goal?
The trivial solution is to create really large protected areas
like the Chagos Archipelago.
The problem is that we can create these large reserves
only in places where there are no people, where there is no social conflict,
where the political cost is really low
and the economic cost is also low.
where people live and make a living out of fishing?
Well, there are three main reasons why
we don't have tens of thousands of small reserves:
The first one is that people have no idea
what marine reserves do,
and fishermen tend to be really, really defensive
Second, the governance is not right
because most coastal communities around the world
don't have the authority
to monitor the resources to create the reserve and enforce it.
It's a top down hierarchical structure
where people wait for
government agents to come
and this is not effective. And the government doesn't have enough resources.
why we don't have many more reserves,
NGOs and governments
spend a lot of time and energy and resources
So marine conservation and coastal protection
has become a sink for government or philanthropic money,
So the solutions are just
fixing these three issues.
First, we need to develop a global awareness campaign
to inspire local communities and governments
to create no-take reserves
that are better than what we have now.
It's the savings accounts
Second, we need to redesign our governance
so conservation efforts can be decentralized,
so conservation efforts don't depend on
work from NGOs
or from government agencies
And third, and very important,
we need to develop new business models.
is an investment,
because we already know
that these marine reserves provide
is going to save the ocean.
There has been a lot of competition in the past,
and we need to develop
a new model of partnership,
truly collaborative,
The stakes are just too high
First of all, your pyramid, your inverted pyramid,
How could 85 percent
survive on 15 percent?
The big one is moving very slowly, and the small one is moving fast.
they reproduce very fast; they grow really fast; they produce millions of eggs.
Up there, you have sharks and large fish that live 25, 30 years.
They reproduce very slowly; they have a slow metabolism;
and, basically, they just maintain their biomass.
So, basically, the production surplus of these guys down there
They are like capacitors of the system.
marine protected areas
we could solve this problem for negative 19 billion dollars.
So again, one of the big solutions is
The last one's a personal question.
A lot of the experience of people here
who've been in the oceans for a long time
has just been seeing this degradation, the places they saw that were beautiful
getting worse, depressing.
and seeing things coming back.
in front of untamed nature, of raw nature.
And there, only there,
you really feel that you are part of a larger thing
I don't think I could continue doing this job.
It would be just too depressing.
We invent.
My company invents
all kinds of new technology
in lots of different areas.
And we do that for a couple of reasons.
We invent for fun --
invention is a lot of fun to do --
and we also invent for profit.
The two are related because
the profit actually takes long enough that if it isn't fun,
you wouldn't have the time to do it.
So we do this
fun and profit-oriented inventing
for most of what we do,
but we also have a program where we invent for humanity --
where we take some of our best inventors,
and we say, "Are there problems
where we have a good idea for solving a problem the world has?" --
and to solve it in the way we try to solve problems,
which is with dramatic, crazy,
out-of-the-box solutions.
Bill Gates is one of those smartest guys of ours
that work on these problems
and he also funds this work, so thank you.
So I'm going to briefly discuss
a couple of problems that we have
and a couple of problems where
we've got some solutions underway.
key techniques in public health,
a fantastic thing.
But in the developing world a lot of vaccines
spoil before they're administered,
and that's because they need to be kept cold.
Almost all vaccines need to be kept at refrigerator temperatures.
They go bad very quickly if you don't,
and if you don't have stable power grid, this doesn't happen,
so kids die.
It's not just the loss of the vaccine that matters;
it's the fact that those kids don't get vaccinated.
This is one of the ways that
vaccines are carried:
These are Styrofoam chests. These are being carried by people,
but they're also put on the backs of pickup trucks.
We've got a different solution.
Now, one of these Styrofoam chests
will last for about four hours with ice in it.
So we made this thing.
This lasts six months with no power;
absolutely zero power,
because it loses less
than a half a watt.
Now, this is our second generations prototype.
The third generation prototype is, right now,
in Uganda being tested.
Now, the reason we were able to come up with this
is two key ideas:
One is that this is similar to a cryogenic Dewar,
something you'd keep liquid nitrogen or liquid helium in.
They have incredible insulation,
so let's put some incredible insulation here.
The other idea is kind of interesting,
which is, you can't reach inside anymore.
Because if you open it up and reach inside,
you'd let the heat in, the game would be over.
So the inside of this thing actually looks like a Coke machine.
It vends out little individual vials.
So a simple idea,
which we hope is going to change the way vaccines are distributed
in Africa and around the world.
Malaria is one of the great public health problems.
Esther Duflo talked a little bit about this.
Two hundred million people a year.
Every 43 seconds a child in Africa dies;
27 will die during my talk.
And there's no way for us here in this country
to grasp really what that means to the people involved.
Another comment of Esther's
was that we react when there's
a tragedy like Haiti,
but that tragedy is ongoing.
So what can we do about it?
Well, there are a lot of things people have tried
for many years for solving malaria.
You can spray; the problem is there are environmental issues.
You can try to treat people and create awareness.
That's great, except the places that have malaria really bad,
they don't have health care systems.
A vaccine would be a terrific thing,
only they don't work yet.
People have tried for a long time. There are a couple of interesting candidates.
It's a very difficult thing to make a vaccine for.
You can distribute bed nets,
and bed nets are very effective if you use them.
You don't always use them for that. People fish with them.
They don't always get to everyone.
And bed nets
have an effect on the epidemic,
but you're never going to make it extinct with bed nets.
an incredibly complicated disease.
We could spend hours going over this.
It's got this sort of soap opera-like lifestyle;
they have sex, they burrow into your liver,
they tunnel into your blood cells ...
it's an incredibly complicated disease,
but that's actually one of the things we find interesting about it
and why we work on malaria:
There's a lot of potential ways in.
One of those ways might be better diagnosis.
So we hope this year
to prototype each of these devices.
One does an automatic malaria diagnosis
in the same way that a diabetic's glucose meter works:
You take a drop of blood,
you put it in there and it automatically tells you.
Today, you need to do a complicated laboratory procedure,
create a bunch of microscope slides
and have a trained person examine it.
it would be even better if you didn't have to draw the blood.
And if you look through the eye,
or you look at the vessels on the white of the eye,
in fact, you may be able to do this
directly, without drawing any blood at all,
or through your nail beds.
Because if you actually look through your fingernails, you can see blood vessels,
and once you see blood vessels, we think we can see the malaria.
We can see it because of this molecule
called hemozoin.
It's produced by the malaria parasite
and it's a very interesting crystalline substance.
Interesting, anyway, if you're a solid-state physicist.
There's a lot of cool stuff we can do with it.
So this creates pulses of light
that last a femtosecond.
That's really, really, really short.
This is a pulse of light that's
only about one wavelength of light long,
so it's a whole bunch of photons
all coming and hitting simultaneously.
It creates a very high peak power
and it lets you do all kinds of interesting things;
in particular, it lets you find hemozoin.
So here's an image of red blood cells,
and now we can actually map
where the hemozoin and where the malaria parasites are
inside those red blood cells.
And using both this technique
and other optical techniques,
we think we can make those diagnostics.
We also have another hemozoin-oriented
therapy for malaria:
a way, in acute cases, to actually
take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system.
Sort of like doing dialysis,
but for relieving the parasite load.
We're kind of software guys,
and so nearly any problem that you pose,
we like to try to solve with some software.
One of the problems that you have if you're trying to eradicate malaria
or reduce it
is you don't know what's the most effective thing to do.
Okay, we heard about bed nets earlier.
You spend a certain amount per bed net.
Or you could spray.
You can give drug administration.
There's all these different interventions
but they have different kinds of effectiveness.
How can you tell?
So we've created, using our supercomputer,
the world's best computer model of malaria,
which we'll show you now.
We have every road,
every village,
every, almost, square inch of Madagascar.
We have all of the precipitation data
and the temperature data.
That's very important because the humidity and precipitation
tell you whether you've got
standing pools of water for the mosquitoes to breed.
So that sets the stage on which you do this.
You then have to introduce the mosquitoes,
and you have to model that
and how they come and go.
Ultimately, it gives you this.
This is malaria spreading
across Madagascar.
And this is this latter part of the rainy season.
We're going to the dry season now.
It nearly goes away in the dry season,
because there's no place for the mosquitoes to breed.
And then, of course, the next year it comes roaring back.
By doing these kinds of simulations,
we want to eradicate or control malaria
thousands of times in software
before we actually have to do it in real life;
to be able to simulate both the economic trade-offs --
how many bed nets versus how much spraying? --
or the social trade-offs --
what happens if unrest breaks out?
This is a high-speed camera view
of a mosquito.
And, in a moment,
we're going to see a view of the airflow.
Here, we're trying to visualize the airflow
around the wings of the mosquito
with little particles we're illuminating with a laser.
By understanding how mosquitoes fly,
we hope to understand how to make them not fly.
Now, one of the ways you can make them not fly
is with DDT.
This is a real ad.
This is one of those things you just can't make up.
Once upon a time, this was the primary technique,
and, in fact, many countries got rid of malaria through DDT.
The United States did.
In 1935, there were 150,000 cases a year
of malaria in the United States,
but DDT and a massive public health effort
managed to squelch it.
"Well, we've done all these things that are focused on the Plasmodium,
the parasite involved.
What can we do to the mosquito?
Well, let's try to kill it with consumer electronics."
Now, that sounds silly,
but each of these devices
has something interesting in it that maybe you could use.
Your Blu-ray player has
a very cheap blue laser.
Your laser printer has a mirror galvanometer
that's used to steer a laser beam very accurately;
that's what makes those little dots on the page.
And, of course, there's signal processing
and digital cameras.
So what if we could put all that together
to shoot them out of the sky with lasers?
"the pinky-suck moment."
Now, just suspend disbelief for a moment,
and let's think of what could happen
if we could do that.
Well, we could protect very high-value targets like clinics.
Clinics are full of people that have malaria.
They're sick, and so they're less able to defend themselves from the mosquitoes.
You really want to protect them.
Of course, if you do that,
you could also protect your backyard.
And farmers could protect their crops
that they want to sell to Whole Foods
because our photons
are 100 percent organic. (Laughter)
They're completely natural.
You could, if you're really smart,
you could shine a nonlethal laser on the bug
before you zap it,
and you could listen to the wing beat frequency
and you could measure the size.
And then you could decide:
"Is this an insect I want to kill,
or an insect I don't want to kill?"
Moore's law made computing cheap;
so cheap we can weigh
the life of an individual insect
and decide thumbs up
or thumbs down. (Laughter)
Now, it turns out we only kill the female mosquitoes.
They're the only ones that are dangerous.
Mosquitoes only drink blood
to lay eggs.
Mosquitoes actually live ... their day-to-day nutrition
comes from nectar, from flowers --
in fact, in the lab, we feed ours raisins --
but the female needs the blood meal.
So, this sounds really crazy, right?
Would you like to see it?
and here it is.
(Laughter)
Now, after thinking about this a little bit
we thought, you know, it probably would be simpler
to do this with a nonlethal laser.
So, Eric Johanson, who built the device,
actually, with parts from eBay;
and Pablos Holman over here,
he's got mosquitoes in the tank.
We have the device over here.
And we're going to show you,
instead of the kill laser,
which will be a very brief, instantaneous pulse,
we're going to have a green laser pointer
that's going to stay on the mosquito for, actually, quite a long period of time;
otherwise, you can't see it very well.
Take it away Eric.
is a tank on the other side of the stage.
And we have ... this computer screen
can actually see the mosquitoes as they fly around.
And Pablos, if he stirs up our mosquitoes a little bit
we can see them flying around.
Now, that's a fairly straightforward image processing routine,
and let me show you how it works.
Here you can see that the insects are being tracked
as they're flying around,
which is kind of fun.
Next we can actually light them up with a laser. (Laughter)
Now, this is a low powered laser,
and we can actually pick up a wing-beat frequency.
So you may be able to hear some mosquitoes flying around.
There you can see mosquitoes as they fly around, being lit up.
This is slowed way down
so that you have an opportunity to see what's happening.
Here we have it running at high-speed mode.
So this system that was built for TED is here to illustrate
that it is technically possible to actually deploy a system like this,
and we're looking very hard at how to make it
highly cost-effective to use in places like Africa and other parts of the world.
without showing you what actually happens when we hit 'em.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
This is very satisfying.
(Laughter)
This is one of the first ones we did.
The energy's a little bit high here.
(Laughter)
We'll loop around here in just a second, and you'll see another one.
Here's another one. Bang.
An interesting thing is, we kill them all the time;
we've never actually gotten the wings to shut off in midair.
The wing motor is very resilient.
I mean, here we're blowing wings off
but the wing motor keeps all the way down.
For me, this story begins about 15 years ago,
when I was a hospice doctor at the University of Chicago.
And I was taking care of people who were dying and their families
in the South Side of Chicago.
And I was observing what happened to people and their families
over the course of their terminal illness.
And in my lab, I was studying the widower effect,
which is a very old idea in the social sciences,
going back 150 years,
known as "dying of a broken heart."
So, when I die, my wife's risk of death can double,
for instance, in the first year.
And I had gone to take care of one particular patient,
a woman who was dying of dementia.
And in this case, unlike this couple,
she was being cared for
by her daughter.
And the daughter was exhausted from caring for her mother.
And the daughter's husband,
he also was sick
from his wife's exhaustion.
And I was driving home one day,
and I get a phone call from the husband's friend,
calling me because he was depressed
about what was happening to his friend.
So here I get this call from this random guy
that's having an experience
that's being influenced by people
at some social distance.
First, the widowhood effect
was not restricted to husbands and wives.
And second, it was not restricted to pairs of people.
And I started to see the world
in a whole new way,
like pairs of people connected to each other.
And then I realized that these individuals
would be connected into foursomes with other pairs of people nearby.
And then, in fact, these people
were embedded in other sorts of relationships:
marriage and spousal
and friendship and other sorts of ties.
And that, in fact, these connections were vast
and that we were all embedded in this
broad set of connections with each other.
So I started to see the world in a completely new way
and I became obsessed with this.
I became obsessed with how it might be
that we're embedded in these social networks,
and how they affect our lives.
So, social networks are these intricate things of beauty,
and they're so elaborate and so complex
and so ubiquitous, in fact,
that one has to ask what purpose they serve.
Why are we embedded in social networks?
I mean, how do they form? How do they operate?
And how do they effect us?
was not death, but obesity.
It had become trendy
to speak about the "obesity epidemic."
And, along with my collaborator, James Fowler,
we began to wonder whether obesity really was epidemic
and could it spread from person to person
like the four people I discussed earlier.
So this is a slide of some of our initial results.
It's 2,200 people in the year 2000.
Every dot is a person. We make the dot size
proportional to people's body size;
so bigger dots are bigger people.
In addition, if your body size,
if your BMI, your body mass index, is above 30 --
if you're clinically obese --
we also colored the dots yellow.
So, if you look at this image, right away you might be able to see
that there are clusters of obese and
non-obese people in the image.
But the visual complexity is still very high.
It's not obvious exactly what's going on.
In addition, some questions are immediately raised:
How much clustering is there?
Is there more clustering than would be due to chance alone?
How big are the clusters? How far do they reach?
And, most importantly,
what causes the clusters?
This here shows, on the Y-axis,
the increase in the probability that a person is obese
given that a social contact of theirs is obese
and, on the X-axis, the degrees of separation between the two people.
On the far left, you see the purple line.
It says that, if your friends are obese,
your risk of obesity is 45 percent higher.
And the next bar over, the [red] line,
says if your friend's friends are obese,
your risk of obesity is 25 percent higher.
And then the next line over says
if your friend's friend's friend, someone you probably don't even know, is obese,
your risk of obesity is 10 percent higher.
And it's only when you get to your friend's friend's friend's friends
that there's no longer a relationship
between that person's body size and your own body size.
There are at least three possibilities:
One possibility is that, as I gain weight,
it causes you to gain weight.
A kind of induction, a kind of spread from person to person.
Another possibility, very obvious, is homophily,
or, birds of a feather flock together;
here, I form my tie to you
because you and I share a similar body size.
And the last possibility is what is known as confounding,
because it confounds our ability to figure out what's going on.
And here, the idea is not that my weight gain
is causing your weight gain,
nor that I preferentially form a tie with you
because you and I share the same body size,
but rather that we share a common exposure
to something, like a health club
that makes us both lose weight at the same time.
including for induction.
And we found that if your friend becomes obese,
it increases your risk of obesity by about 57 percent
in the same given time period.
There can be many mechanisms for this effect:
One possibility is that your friends say to you something like --
you know, they adopt a behavior that spreads to you --
like, they say, "Let's go have muffins and beer,"
which is a terrible combination. (Laughter)
But you adopt that combination,
and then you start gaining weight like them.
Another more subtle possibility
is that they start gaining weight, and it changes your ideas
of what an acceptable body size is.
Here, what's spreading from person to person
is not a behavior, but rather a norm:
An idea is spreading.
had a field day with our studies.
I think the headline in The New York Times was,
"Are you packing it on?
Blame your fat friends." (Laughter)
What was interesting to us is that the European headline writers
had a different take: They said,
"Are your friends gaining weight? Perhaps you are to blame."
(Laughter)
And we thought this was a very interesting comment on America,
and a kind of self-serving,
"not my responsibility" kind of phenomenon.
should or could justify prejudice
against people of one or another body size at all.
Our next questions was:
Could we actually visualize this spread?
Was weight gain in one person actually spreading
to weight gain in another person?
And this was complicated because
we needed to take into account the fact that the network structure,
the architecture of the ties, was changing across time.
In addition, because obesity is not a unicentric epidemic,
there's not a Patient Zero of the obesity epidemic --
if we find that guy, there was a spread of obesity out from him --
it's a multicentric epidemic.
Lots of people are doing things at the same time.
And I'm about to show you a 30 second video animation
that took me and James five years of our lives to do.
So, again, every dot is a person.
Every tie between them is a relationship.
We're going to put this into motion now,
taking daily cuts through the network for about 30 years.
you're going to see a sea of yellow take over.
You're going to see people be born and die --
dots will appear and disappear --
ties will form and break, marriages and divorces,
friendings and defriendings.
A lot of complexity, a lot is happening
just in this 30-year period
that includes the obesity epidemic.
And, by the end, you're going to see clusters
of obese and non-obese individuals
within the network.
Now, when looked at this,
it changed the way I see things,
because this thing, this network
that's changing across time,
it has a memory, it moves,
things flow within it,
it has a kind of consistency --
people can die, but it doesn't die;
it still persists --
and it has a kind of resilience
that allows it to persist across time.
as living things,
as living things that we could put under a kind of microscope
to study and analyze and understand.
And we used a variety of techniques to do this.
And we started exploring all kinds of other phenomena.
We looked at smoking and drinking behavior,
and voting behavior,
and divorce -- which can spread --
and altruism.
And, eventually, we became interested in emotions.
Now, when we have emotions,
we show them.
Why do we show our emotions?
I mean, there would be an advantage to experiencing
our emotions inside, you know, anger or happiness.
But we don't just experience them, we show them.
And not only do we show them, but others can read them.
And, not only can they read them, but they copy them.
There's emotional contagion
that takes place in human populations.
And so this function of emotions
suggests that, in addition to any other purpose they serve,
they're a kind of primitive form of communication.
And that, in fact, if we really want to understand human emotions,
we need to think about them in this way.
in simple, sort of, brief periods of time.
So, for example,
I was giving this talk recently in New York City,
and I said, "You know when you're on the subway
and the other person across the subway car
smiles at you,
and you just instinctively smile back?"
And they looked at me and said, "We don't do that in New York City." (Laughter)
And I said, "Everywhere else in the world,
that's normal human behavior."
And so there's a very instinctive way
in which we briefly transmit emotions to each other.
And, in fact, emotional contagion can be broader still.
Like we could have punctuated expressions of anger,
as in riots.
The question that we wanted to ask was:
Could emotion spread,
in a more sustained way than riots, across time
and involve large numbers of people,
not just this pair of individuals smiling at each other in the subway car?
Maybe there's a kind of below the surface, quiet riot
that animates us all the time.
Maybe there are emotional stampedes
that ripple through social networks.
Maybe, in fact, emotions have a collective existence,
not just an individual existence.
Again, a social network,
but now we color the people yellow if they're happy
and blue if they're sad and green in between.
And if you look at this image, you can right away see
clusters of happy and unhappy people,
again, spreading to three degrees of separation.
And you might form the intuition
that the unhappy people
occupy a different structural location within the network.
There's a middle and an edge to this network,
and the unhappy people seem to be
located at the edges.
So to invoke another metaphor,
if you imagine social networks as a kind of
vast fabric of humanity --
I'm connected to you and you to her, on out endlessly into the distance --
this fabric is actually like
an old-fashioned American quilt,
and it has patches on it: happy and unhappy patches.
And whether you become happy or not
depends in part on whether you occupy a happy patch.
which are so fundamental,
then got us to thinking about: Maybe
the fundamental causes of human social networks
are somehow encoded in our genes.
Because human social networks, whenever they are mapped,
always kind of look like this:
the picture of the network.
But they never look like this.
Why do they not look like this?
Why don't we form human social networks
that look like a regular lattice?
Well, the striking patterns of human social networks,
their ubiquity and their apparent purpose
beg questions about whether we evolved to have
human social networks in the first place,
and whether we evolved to form networks
with a particular structure.
we need to dissect network structure a little bit first --
and notice that every person in this network
has exactly the same structural location as every other person.
But that's not the case with real networks.
So, for example, here is a real network of college students
at an elite northeastern university.
And now I'm highlighting a few dots.
If you look here at the dots,
compare node B in the upper left
to node D in the far right;
B has four friends coming out from him
and D has six friends coming out from him.
And so, those two individuals have different numbers of friends.
That's very obvious, we all know that.
But certain other aspects
of social network structure are not so obvious.
Now, those people both have four friends,
but A's friends all know each other,
and B's friends do not.
So the friend of a friend of A's
is, back again, a friend of A's,
whereas the friend of a friend of B's is not a friend of B's,
but is farther away in the network.
This is known as transitivity in networks.
And, finally, compare nodes C and D:
C and D both have six friends.
If you talk to them, and you said, "What is your social life like?"
they would say, "I've got six friends.
That's my social experience."
But now we, with a bird's eye view looking at this network,
can see that they occupy very different social worlds.
And I can cultivate that intuition in you by just asking you:
Who would you rather be
if a deadly germ was spreading through the network?
Would you rather be C or D?
You'd rather be D, on the edge of the network.
And now who would you rather be
if a juicy piece of gossip -- not about you --
was spreading through the network? (Laughter)
Now, you would rather be C.
have different implications for your life.
And, in fact, when we did some experiments looking at this,
what we found is that 46 percent of the variation
in how many friends you have
is explained by your genes.
And this is not surprising. We know that some people are born shy
and some are born gregarious. That's obvious.
But we also found some non-obvious things.
For instance, 47 percent in the variation
in whether your friends know each other
is attributable to your genes.
Whether your friends know each other
has not just to do with their genes, but with yours.
And we think the reason for this is that some people
like to introduce their friends to each other -- you know who you are --
and others of you keep them apart and don't introduce your friends to each other.
And so some people knit together the networks around them,
creating a kind of dense web of ties
in which they're comfortably embedded.
And finally, we even found that
30 percent of the variation
in whether or not people are in the middle or on the edge of the network
can also be attributed to their genes.
So whether you find yourself in the middle or on the edge
is also partially heritable.
How does this help us understand?
How does this help us
figure out some of the problems that are affecting us these days?
Well, the argument I'd like to make is that networks have value.
They are a kind of social capital.
New properties emerge
because of our embeddedness in social networks,
and these properties inhere
in the structure of the networks,
not just in the individuals within them.
So think about these two common objects.
They're both made of carbon,
and yet one of them has carbon atoms in it
that are arranged in one particular way -- on the left --
and you get graphite, which is soft and dark.
But if you take the same carbon atoms
and interconnect them a different way,
you get diamond, which is clear and hard.
And those properties of softness and hardness and darkness and clearness
do not reside in the carbon atoms;
they reside in the interconnections between the carbon atoms,
or at least arise because of the
interconnections between the carbon atoms.
So, similarly, the pattern of connections among people
confers upon the groups of people
different properties.
It is the ties between people
that makes the whole greater than the sum of its parts.
And so it is not just what's happening to these people --
whether they're losing weight or gaining weight, or becoming rich or becoming poor,
or becoming happy or not becoming happy -- that affects us;
it's also the actual architecture
of the ties around us.
depends on the actual structure
of the networks in which we're residing
and on all the kinds of things that ripple and flow
through the network.
Now, the reason, I think, that this is the case
is that human beings assemble themselves
and form a kind of superorganism.
Now, a superorganism is a collection of individuals
which show or evince behaviors or phenomena
that are not reducible to the study of individuals
and that must be understood by reference to,
and by studying, the collective.
Like, for example, a hive of bees
that's finding a new nesting site,
or a flock of birds that's evading a predator,
or a flock of birds that's able to pool its wisdom
and navigate and find a tiny speck
of an island in the middle of the Pacific,
or a pack of wolves that's able
to bring down larger prey.
Superorganisms have properties
that cannot be understood just by studying the individuals.
I think understanding social networks
and how they form and operate
can help us understand not just health and emotions
but all kinds of other phenomena --
like crime, and warfare,
and economic phenomena like bank runs
and market crashes
and the adoption of innovation
and the spread of product adoption.
I think we form social networks
because the benefits of a connected life
outweigh the costs.
If I was always violent towards you
or gave you misinformation
or made you sad or infected you with deadly germs,
you would cut the ties to me,
and the network would disintegrate.
So the spread of good and valuable things
is required to sustain and nourish social networks.
Similarly, social networks are required
for the spread of good and valuable things,
like love and kindness
and happiness and altruism
and ideas.
I think, in fact, that if we realized
how valuable social networks are,
we'd spend a lot more time nourishing them and sustaining them,
because I think social networks
are fundamentally related to goodness.
And what I think the world needs now
is more connections.
I bring to you
a message from
tens of thousands of people --
in the villages, in the slums,
in the hinterland of the country --
who have solved problems
through their own genius,
a war on
one third of India,
about 200 districts that he mentioned
were ungovernable,
he missed the point.
The point that we have been stressing
for the last 21 years,
the minds on the margin
are not the marginal minds.
That is the message,
which we started 31 years ago.
And what did it start?
which led me to come to this point.
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh
advising the government and the research council there
how to help scientists work on the lands,
on the fields of the poor people,
and how to develop research technologies,
which are based on the knowledge of the people.
I had been tremendously invigorated
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,
which had 60 percent landlessness
but amazing creativity.
I started looking at my own work:
for the previous 10 years,
almost every time,
had instances of knowledge
that people had shared.
and I looked at my income tax return
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,
which shows how much of this income has gone
to the people whose knowledge
has made it possible?
Is it that I articulate very well?
Is it that I analyze the data very well?
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,
I must be entitled to this reward from society?"
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,
I have worked for the policy changes.
You know, the public policy will become
more responsive to the needs of the poor,
and, therefore I think it's okay."
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --
exploitation by landlords,
by moneylenders, by traders --
probably I was also an exploiter,
which showed this income accrued
because of the brilliance of the people --
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --
and nothing ever went back to them.
So much so, that much of my work till that time
was in the English language.
So what kind of a contributor was I?
I was talking about social justice,
who was pursuing the most unjust act --
getting rent from that knowledge
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and
publishing them in the papers,
getting invited to the conferences,
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma
because I couldn't live with it any longer.
So I did a review of
And I came to the conclusion that
while dilemma is unique,
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.
while coming back from the office towards home,
maybe I saw a honey bee
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,
What the honey bee does: it pollinates,
takes nectar from the flower,
pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.
that whenever we learn something from people
it must be shared with them in their language.
They must not remain anonymous.
I have not made one percent of change
in the professional practice of this art.
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --
that the profession still legitimizes publication
of knowledge of people without attributing them
by making them anonymous.
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences
or Research Councils of the U.K.
or of Indian Councils of Science Research
do not require
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.
And India wants to be a knowledge society.
How will it be a knowledge society?
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,
one for yourself and one for others.
You cannot discriminate.
You cannot be in favor of your own values,
which are at a distance from
the values that you espouse.
So, fairness to one and to the other
is not divisible.
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,
and what is it meant for? Anybody?
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)
Anybody? Any guess at all?
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?
(Murmuring)
Pardon?
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.
It invites tourists
to see the shame of our country.
I'm so sorry to say that.
Is this a beautiful picture
or is it a terrible picture?
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.
If this woman has to carry water on her head
for miles and miles and miles,
you cannot be celebrating that.
We should be doing something about it.
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,
millions of women still carry water on their heads.
And we do not ask this question.
Think for a minute.
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;
you know what the action is? The action is:
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.
Just do it 10 times;
you will realize the pain in this shoulder.
And she does it a few thousand times
every day.
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,
is transplanted by women
bending in a very awkward posture,
millions of them,
every season, in the paddy season,
with their feet in the water.
And feet in the water will develop fungus,
and that infection pains
because then other insects bite that point.
And every year,
99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.
No machines have been developed.
of technologists, of public policy makers,
of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;
this is not the way society will work.
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,
we have a program for employment:
One hundred, 250 million people
have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.
So we asked a question to the parliament:
Do poor have heads?
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?
And what has happened?
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person
gets in contact with the network,
and then gets an identity.
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.
And this network grew voluntarily,
continues to be voluntary,
of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.
They could be creative in terms of education,
either in terms of contemporary innovations,
or in terms of traditional knowledge.
he had a wish.
"God, please cure him.
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."
And this is what he got painted.
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.
There could be nothing more wrong than
the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs
because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,
they were all poor people,
and they had a great reason. (Applause)
Please do not ever think that
only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs
can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.
Any person anywhere is capable
of rising to that highest point of attainment,
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk
in different parts of the country.
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.
we found these dung cakes,
which are used as a fuel.
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,
has made a painting.
That's the only space she could express her creativity.
And she's so marvelous.
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,
to hear about the tragedy, pain
of indigo growers.
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.
Is she an artisan or an artist?
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.
If we can create markets for these artists,
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.
In Motihari in Champaran,
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack
and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.
So he thought, why don't I convert
he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,
and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)
(Applause)
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.
A lot of poor people do not have
enough grains to get ground.
So this fellow is bringing
a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.
They have needs which
have to be met efficiently
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.
But to be able to give them high-quality output
you need to adapt technology to their needs.
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,
he brought a washing machine
to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.
So here's a model where
a two-wheeler washing machine ...
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.
(Applause)
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee
for you per lot,
and a new business model can emerge.
Now, what we need is, we need
people who will be able to scale them up.
It looks like a beautiful photograph.
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?
Somebody from India would know, of course.
It's a tawa.
It's a hot plate made of clay.
When you have a non-stick pan,
five dollars, six dollars.
food-grade materials.
while you use a costly non-stick pan,
you eat the so-called Teflon
or Teflon-like material
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)
You know? But here
in this clay hot plate,
it will never go into your stomach.
So it is better, it is safer;
it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,
And now with one dollar,
you can afford a better alternative
than the people market is offering you.
This lady, she developed
a herbal pesticide formulation.
and she would get revenue.
Now, let me mention one thing:
I think we need a polycentric model of development,
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,
in different parts of the world,
would solve the needs of locality
in a very efficient and adaptive manner.
Higher the local fit,
greater is the chance of scaling up.
there's an inherent inadequacy
to match the needs of the local people,
point by point, with the supply that you're making.
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,
only three options on the cellphone.
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.
But if I had to get a match to match,
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.
So what we're saying is that scalability
should not become an enemy of sustainability.
There must be a place in the world
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,
and yet, one can be able to fund them.
that many times investors would ask this question --
"What is a scalable model?" --
as if the need of a community, which is only
located in a space and time
and has those needs only located in those places,
has no legitimate right to get them for free
because it's not part of a larger scale.
or else you remain out.
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model
tells you that small sales
of a large number of books, for example,
having only a few copies sold
can still be a viable model.
And we must find a mechanism where
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,
where different innovations will go to
a small number of people in their localities,
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.
At the age of 70,
he is linking up something very creative.
I had to meet my love.
My desperation made me an innovator.
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.
New inventions are the passion of my life.

in Motihari, again in Champaran.
Wonderful human being,
but he stills sells, at this age,
honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,
the lake people, in [unclear] operations.
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office
because you can then go to those lanes
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.
So we have not yet cracked the problem
of making it available as a rescue device,
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,
when you have to deliver things to people
in different islands

I've been playing TED for nearly a decade,
and I've very rarely played
any new songs of my own.
And that was largely because there weren't any.
and one of them was this:
The Nutmeg.
A 1930s ship's lifeboat,
which I've been restoring in the garden
of my beach house in England.
And, so now,
when the polar ice caps melt,
my recording studio will rise up like an ark,
and I'll float off into the drowned world
like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel.
During the day,
the Nutmeg collects energy
from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse,
and from a 450 watt turbine
up the mast.
So that when it gets dark,
I've got plenty of power.
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon.
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning,
and I work on new songs.
I'd like to play to you guys,

And it appears that,

mostly a coral reef ecologist.
I started out in Chesapeake Bay
and went diving in the winter
and became a tropical ecologist overnight.
And it was really a lot of fun
for about 10 years.
I mean, somebody pays you
to go around and travel
and look at some of the most
beautiful places on the planet.
And that was what I did.
in the West Indies,
where the coral reefs were really
among the most extraordinary, structurally,
that I ever saw in my life.
And this picture here,
it's really interesting, it shows two things:
First of all, it's in black and white
because the water was so clear
and you could see so far,
and film was so slow
in the 1960s and early 70s,
you took pictures in black and white.
The other thing it shows you
is that, although there's this beautiful
forest of coral,
there are no fish in that picture.
were the most studied coral reefs
in the world for 20 years.
We were the best and the brightest.
People came to study our reefs from Australia,
which is sort of funny
because now we go to theirs.
And the view of scientists
about how coral reefs work, how they ought to be,
was based on these reefs
without any fish.
Then, in 1980,
there was a hurricane, Hurricane Allen.
I put half the lab
up in my house.
The wind blew very strong.
The waves were 25
to 50 feet high.
And the reefs disappeared, and new islands formed,
and we thought, "Well, we're real smart.
We know that hurricanes
have always happened in the past."
And we published a paper in Science,
the first time that anybody ever
described the destruction
on a coral reef by a major hurricane.
And we predicted what would happen,
and we got it all wrong.
And the reason was
because of overfishing,
and the fact that a last common grazer,
a sea urchin, died.
And within a few months
after that sea urchin dying, the seaweed started to grow.
And that is the same reef;
that's the same reef 15 years ago;
that's the same reef today.
The coral reefs of the north coast of Jamaica
have a few percent live coral cover
and a lot of seaweed and slime.
And that's more or less the story
of the coral reefs of the Caribbean,
and increasingly, tragically,
the coral reefs worldwide.
All of us in our 60s and 70s
have comparable depressing stories.
There are tens of thousands
of those stories out there,
and it's really hard to conjure up
much of a sense of well-being,
because it just keeps getting worse.
And the reason it keeps getting worse
is that after a natural catastrophe,
like a hurricane,
it used to be that there was
some kind of successional sequence of recovery,
but what's going on now is that
overfishing and pollution and climate change
are all interacting
in a way that prevents that.
And so I'm going to sort of go through
and talk about those three
kinds of things.
the collapse of cod.
It's difficult to imagine that
two, or some historians would say three world wars
were fought during the colonial era
for the control of cod.
Cod fed most of the people of Western Europe.
It fed the slaves
brought to the Antilles,
the song "Jamaica Farewell" --
"Ackee rice salt fish are nice" --
is an emblem of the importance
of salt cod from northeastern Canada.
It all collapsed in the 80s and the 90s:
35,000 people lost their jobs.
And that was the beginning
of a kind of serial depletion
from bigger and tastier species
to smaller and not-so-tasty species,
from species that were near to home
to species that were all around the world,
and what have you.
It's a little hard to understand that,
because you can go to a Costco in the United States
and buy cheap fish.
You ought to read the label to find out where it came from,
but it's still cheap,
and everybody thinks it's okay.
and one way that I think is really interesting
is to talk about sport fish,
because people like to go out and catch fish.
It's one of those things.
This picture here shows the trophy fish,
the biggest fish caught
by people who pay a lot of money
to get on a boat,
go to a place off of Key West in Florida,
drink a lot of beer,
throw a lot of hooks and lines into the water,
come back with the biggest and the best fish,
and the champion trophy fish
are put on this board, where people take a picture,
and this guy is obviously
really excited about that fish.
Well, that's what it's like now,
but this is what it was like in the 1950s
from the same boat in the same place
on the same board on the same dock.
The trophy fish
were so big
that you couldn't put any of those small fish up on it.
And the average size trophy fish
weighed 250 to 300 pounds, goliath grouper,
and if you wanted to go out and kill something,
you could pretty much count on
being able to catch one of those fish.
And they tasted really good.
And people paid less in 1950 dollars
to catch that
than what people pay now
to catch those little, tiny fish.
And that's everywhere.
that are disappearing.
Industrial fishing uses big stuff,
big machinery.
We use nets that are 20 miles long.
We use longlines
that have one million or two million hooks.
And we trawl,
which means to take something
the size of a tractor trailer truck
that weighs thousands and thousands of pounds,
put it on a big chain,
and drag it across the sea floor
to stir up the bottom and catch the fish.
Think of it as
being kind of the bulldozing of a city
or of a forest,
because it clears it away.
And the habitat destruction
is unbelievable.
This is a photograph,
a typical photograph,
of what the continental shelves
of the world look like.
You can see the rows in the bottom,
the way you can see the rows
in a field that has just been plowed
to plant corn.
What that was, was a forest of sponges and coral,
which is a critical habitat
for the development of fish.
What it is now is mud,
and the area of the ocean floor
that has been transformed from forest
to level mud, to parking lot,
is equivalent to the entire area
of all the forests
that have ever been cut down
on all of the earth
in the history of humanity.
We've managed to do that
in the last 100 to 150 years.
and mercury
and we hear a lot about plastic these days.
And all of that stuff is really disgusting,
but what's really insidious
is the biological pollution that happens
because of the magnitude of the shifts
that it causes
to entire ecosystems.
And I'm going to just talk very briefly
about two kinds of biological pollution:
one is introduced species
and the other is what comes from nutrients.
So this is the infamous
Caulerpa taxifolia,
the so-called killer algae.
A book was written about it.
It's a bit of an embarrassment.
It was accidentally released
from the aquarium in Monaco,
it was bred to be cold tolerant
to have in peoples aquaria.
It's very pretty,
and it has rapidly started
to overgrow
the once very rich
biodiversity of the
northwestern Mediterranean.
I don't know how many of you remember the movie
"The Little Shop of Horrors,"
but this is the plant of "The Little Shop of Horrors."
But, instead of devouring the people in the shop,
what it's doing is overgrowing
and smothering
virtually all of the bottom-dwelling life
of the entire northwestern
Mediterranean Sea.
We don't know anything that eats it,
we're trying to do all sorts of genetics
and figure out something that could be done,
but, as it stands, it's the monster from hell,
about which nobody knows what to do.
that's biological pollution
is what happens from excess nutrients.
The green revolution,
all of this artificial nitrogen fertilizer, we use too much of it.
It's subsidized, which is one of the reasons we used too much of it.
It runs down the rivers,
and it feeds the plankton,
the little microscopic plant cells
in the coastal water.
But since we ate all the oysters
and we ate all the fish that would eat the plankton,
there's nothing to eat the plankton
and there's more and more of it,
so it dies of old age,
which is unheard of for plankton.
And when it dies, it falls to the bottom
and then it rots,
which means that bacteria break it down.
And in the process
they use up all the oxygen,
and in using up all the oxygen
they make the environment utterly lethal
for anything that can't swim away.
So, what we end up with
is a microbial zoo
dominated by bacteria
and jellyfish, as you see
on the left in front of you.
And the only fishery left --
and it is a commercial fishery --
is the jellyfish fishery
you see on the right, where there used to be prawns.
Even in Newfoundland
where we used to catch cod,
we now have a jellyfish fishery.
is what is often called red tides
or toxic blooms.
That picture on the left is just staggering to me.
I have talked about it a million times,
but it's unbelievable.
In the upper right of that picture on the left
is almost the Mississippi Delta,
and the lower left of that picture
is the Texas-Mexico border.
You're looking at the entire
northwestern Gulf of Mexico;
you're looking at one toxic
dinoflagellate bloom that can kill fish,
made by that beautiful little creature
on the lower right.
And in the upper right you see this
black sort of cloud
moving ashore.
That's the same species.
And as it comes to shore and the wind blows,
and little droplets of the water get into the air,
the emergency rooms of all the hospitals fill up
with people with acute respiratory distress.
And that's retirement homes
on the west coast of Florida.
A friend and I did this thing in Hollywood
we called Hollywood ocean night,
and I was trying to figure out how to
explain to actors what's going on.
And I said,
"So, imagine you're in a movie called 'Escape from Malibu'
because all the beautiful people have moved
to North Dakota, where it's clean and safe.
And the only people who are left there
are the people who can't afford
to move away from the coast,
because the coast, instead of being paradise,
is harmful to your health."
It was when I was on holiday last early autumn in France.
This is from the coast of Brittany,
which is being enveloped
in this green, algal slime.
The reason that it attracted so much attention,
besides the fact that it's disgusting,
is that sea birds flying over it
are asphyxiated by the smell and die,
and a farmer died of it,
and you can imagine the scandal that happened.
And so there's this war
between the farmers
and the fishermen about it all,
and the net result is that
the beaches of Brittany have to be bulldozed of this stuff
on a regular basis.
and we all know about climate change.
I guess the iconic figure of it
is the melting of the ice
in the Arctic Sea.
Think about the thousands and thousands of people who died
trying to find the Northwest Passage.
Well, the Northwest Passage is already there.
I think it's sort of funny;
it's on the Siberian coast,
maybe the Russians will charge tolls.
The governments of the world
are taking this really seriously.
The military of the Arctic nations
is taking it really seriously.
For all the denial of climate change
by government leaders,
the CIA
and the navies of Norway
and the U.S. and Canada, whatever
are busily thinking about
how they will secure their territory
in this inevitability
from their point of view.
And, of course, Arctic communities are toast.
this is coral bleaching. It's a beautiful picture, right?
All that white coral.
Except it's supposed to be brown.
What happens is that
the corals are a symbiosis,
and they have these little algal cells
that live inside them.
And the algae give the corals sugar,
and the corals give the algae
nutrients and protection.
But when it gets too hot,
the algae can't make the sugar.
The corals say, "You cheated. You didn't pay your rent."
They kick them out, and then they die.
Not all of them die; some of them survive,
some more are surviving,
but it's really bad news.
To try and give you a sense of this,
imagine you go camping in July
somewhere in Europe or in North America,
and you wake up the next morning, and you look around you,
and you see that 80 percent of the trees,
as far as you can see,
have dropped their leaves and are standing there naked.
And you come home, and you discover
that 80 percent of all the trees
in North America and in Europe
have dropped their leaves.
And then you read in the paper a few weeks later,
"Oh, by the way, a quarter of those died."
Well, that's what happened in the Indian Ocean
during the 1998 El Nino,
an area vastly greater
than the size of North America and Europe,
when 80 percent of all the corals bleached
and a quarter of them died.
about all of this --
the overfishing, the pollution and the climate change --
is that each thing doesn't happen in a vacuum.
But there are these, what we call, positive feedbacks,
the synergies among them
that make the whole vastly greater
than the sum of the parts.
And the great scientific challenge
for people like me in thinking about all this,
is do we know how
to put Humpty Dumpty back together again?
I mean, because we, at this point, we can protect it.
But what does that mean?
We really don't know.
in 20 or 50 years?
Well, there won't be any fish
except for minnows,
and the water will be pretty dirty,
and all those kinds of things
and full of mercury, etc., etc.
And dead zones will get bigger and bigger
and they'll start to merge,
and we can imagine something like
the dead-zonification
of the global, coastal ocean.
Then you sure won't want to eat fish that were raised in it,
because it would be a kind of
That doesn't sell.
are the physical, chemical,
oceanographic things that are happening.
As the surface of the ocean gets warmer,
the water is lighter when it's warmer,
it becomes harder and harder
to turn the ocean over.
We say it becomes
more strongly stratified.
The consequence of that is that
all those nutrients
that fuel the great anchoveta fisheries,
of the sardines of California
or in Peru or whatever,
those slow down
and those fisheries collapse.
And, at the same time,
water from the surface, which is rich in oxygen,
doesn't make it down
and the ocean turns into a desert.
going to respond to this?
And we can do
all sorts of things to fix it,
but in the final analysis,
the thing we really need to fix
is ourselves.
It's not about the fish; it's not about the pollution;
it's not about the climate change.
It's about us
and our greed and our need for growth
and our inability to imagine a world
that is different from the selfish world
we live in today.
So the question is: Will we respond to this or not?
I would say that the future of life
and the dignity of human beings
depends on our doing that.
Or better, how do you explain
For example:
Why is Apple so innovative?
Year after year, after year,
they're more innovative than all their competition.
And yet, they're just a computer company.
They're just like everyone else.
They have the same access to the same talent,
And why is it that the Wright brothers
were able to figure out controlled, powered man flight
when there were certainly other teams
who were better qualified, better funded --
and they didn't achieve powered man flight,
and the Wright brothers beat them to it.
As it turns out, there's a pattern.
whether it's Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers,
All I did was codify it,
I call it the golden circle.
This little idea explains
Let me define the terms really quickly.
Every single person, every single organization on the planet
Some know how they do it,
And by "why" I don't mean "to make a profit."
That's a result. It's always a result.
By "why," I mean: What's your purpose?
What's your cause? What's your belief?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning?
And why should anyone care?
As a result, the way we think, we act,
I use Apple because they're easy to understand and everybody gets it.
If Apple were like everyone else,
a marketing message from them might sound like this:
That's how most of us communicate.
That's how most marketing and sales are done,
Here's our new car:
It gets great gas mileage, it has leather seats.
We believe in thinking differently.

simple to use and user friendly.
We just happen to make great computers.
I just reversed the order of the information.
is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple.
But we're also perfectly comfortable
buying an MP3 player from Apple, or a phone from Apple,
or a DVR from Apple.
Their competitors are equally qualified to make all of these products.
In fact, they tried.
A few years ago, Gateway came out with flat-screen TVs.
They're eminently qualified to make flat-screen TVs.
They've been making flat-screen monitors for years.
Nobody bought one.
and they make great quality products,
and they can make perfectly well-designed products --
and nobody bought one.
In fact, talking about it now, we can't even imagine
buying an MP3 player from Dell.
Why would you buy one from a computer company?
But we do it every day.
People don't buy what you do; they buy why you do it.
It's all grounded in the tenets of biology.
Not psychology, biology.
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain,
from the top down, the human brain is actually broken
into three major components
that correlate perfectly with the golden circle.
Our newest brain, our Homo sapien brain,
our neocortex,
corresponds with the "what" level.
The neocortex is responsible
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains,
and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings,
like trust and loyalty.
It's also responsible for all human behavior,
all decision-making,
and it has no capacity for language.
yes, people can understand vast amounts of complicated information
like features and benefits and facts and figures.
It just doesn't drive behavior.
When we can communicate from the inside out,
we're talking directly to the part of the brain
that controls behavior,
Why would we use that verb, it doesn't "feel" right?
It's all happening here in your limbic brain,
the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language.
and people respond to why you do what you do,
then how will you ever get people
to vote for you, or buy something from you,
or, more importantly, be loyal
and want to be a part of what it is that you do.
The goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have;
the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe.
it's to hire people who believe what you believe.
but if they believe what you believe,
they'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears.
the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day.
Everybody was trying it.
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had, what we assume,
to be the recipe for success.
and people always give you the same permutation
of the same three things:
under-capitalized, the wrong people, bad market conditions.
It's always the same three things, so let's explore that.
Samuel Pierpont Langley
was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department
to figure out this flying machine.
Money was no problem.
He held a seat at Harvard
and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected;
he knew all the big minds of the day.
and the market conditions were fantastic.
The New York Times followed him around everywhere,
and everyone was rooting for Langley.
Then how come we've never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley?
They had no money;
they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop.
not even Orville or Wilbur.
And The New York Times followed them around nowhere.
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different.
He wanted to be rich, and he wanted to be famous.
He was in pursuit of the result.
He was in pursuit of the riches.
The others just worked for the paycheck.
They tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out,
they would have to take five sets of parts,
and no one was there to even experience it.
He could have said,
"That's an amazing discovery, guys,
and I will improve upon your technology," but he didn't.
If you talk about what you believe,
you will attract those who believe what you believe.

I love asking businesses, "What's your conversion on new business?"
as Jeffrey Moore calls it, "Crossing the Chasm" --
And these guys, the innovators and the early adopters,
they're comfortable making those gut decisions.
They're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions

These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars

And when they went IPO,
their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars

In fact, I don't think it's even traded above six,

In the summer of 1963,
to hear Dr. King speak.
They sent out no invitations,
and there was no website to check the date.
How do you do that?
Well, Dr. King wasn't the only man in America
He didn't go around telling people what needed to change in America.
And some of those people created structures
They showed up for themselves.

It's what they believed, and it wasn't about black versus white:

Because there are leaders and there are those who lead.
but those who lead inspire us.

So here it is. You can check: I am short, I'm French,
I have a pretty strong French accent,
so that's going to be clear in a moment.
and something you all know about.
And I suspect many of you gave
something to the people of Haiti this year.
And there is something else
I believe in the back of your mind
you also know.
That is, every day,
25,000 children die
of entirely preventable causes.
That's a Haiti earthquake every eight days.
And I suspect many of you probably gave something
towards that problem as well,
but somehow it doesn't happen
with the same intensity.
Well, here is a thought experiment for you.
Imagine you have a few million dollars that you've raised --
maybe you're a politician in a developing country
and you have a budget to spend. You want to spend it on the poor:
How do you go about it?
Do you believe the people who tell you
that all we need to do is to spend money?
That we know how to eradicate poverty,
we just need to do more?
Or do you believe the people who tell you that
aid is not going to help, on the contrary it might hurt,
it might exacerbate corruption, dependence, etc.?
Or maybe you turn to the past.
After all, we have spent billions of dollars on aid.
Maybe you look at the past and see.
Has it done any good?
And worst of all, we will never know.
And the reason is that -- take Africa for example.
Africans have already got a lot of aid.
These are the blue bars.
And the GDP in Africa is not making much progress.
Okay, fine. How do you know what
would have happened without the aid?
Maybe it would have been much worse,
or maybe it would have been better.
We have no idea. We don't know what the counterfactual is.
There's only one Africa.
To give the aid, and hope and pray that something comes out of it?
Or do you focus on your everyday life
and let the earthquake every eight days
continue to happen?
The thing is, if we don't know
whether we are doing any good,
we are not any better
than the Medieval doctors and their leeches.
Sometimes the patient gets better, sometimes the patient dies.
Is it the leeches? Is it something else?
We don't know.
They're smaller questions,
but they are not that small.
Immunization, that's the cheapest way
to save a child's life.
And the world has spent a lot of money on it:
The GAVI and the Gates Foundations
are each pledging a lot of money towards it,
and developing countries themselves have been doing a lot of effort.
And yet, every year
at least 25 million children
do not get the immunization they should get.
So this is what you call a "last mile problem."
The technology is there,
the infrastructure is there,
and yet it doesn't happen.
So you have your million.
How do you use your million
to solve this last mile problem?
Malaria. Malaria kills almost
900,000 people every year,
most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa,
most of them under five.
In fact, that is the leading cause of under-five mortality.
We already know how to kill malaria,
but some people come to you and say,
"You have your millions. How about bed nets?"
Bed nets are very cheap.
For 10 dollars, you can manufacture and ship
an insecticide treated bed net
and you can teach someone to use them.
And, not only do they protect the people who sleep under them,
but they have these great contagion benefits.
If half of a community sleeps under a net,
the other half also benefits
because the contagion of the disease spread.
And yet, only a quarter of kids at risk sleep under a net.
Societies should be willing to go out
and subsidize the net, give them for free,
or, for that matter, pay people to use them
because of those contagion benefits.
"Not so fast," say other people.
"If you give the nets for free,
people are not going to value them.
They're not going to use them,
or at least they're not going to use them as bed nets,
maybe as fishing nets."
So, what do you do?
Do you give the nets for free to maximize coverage,
or do you make people pay
in order to make sure that they really value them?
How do you know?
Maybe that's the solution, maybe we should send kids to school.
But how do you do that?
Do you hire teachers? Do you build more schools?
Do you provide school lunch?
How do you know?
I cannot answer the big question,
whether aid did any good or not.
But these three questions, I can answer them.
It's not the Middle Ages anymore,
it's the 21st century.
And in the 20th century,
randomized, controlled trials
have revolutionized medicine
by allowing us to distinguish
between drugs that work
and drugs that don't work.
And you can do the same
randomized, controlled trial for social policy.
You can put social innovation to the same
rigorous, scientific tests
that we use for drugs.
And in this way, you can take the guesswork
out of policy-making
by knowing what works,
what doesn't work and why.
And I'll give you some examples with those three questions.
Here's Udaipur District, Rajasthan. Beautiful.
Well, when I started working there,
about one percent of children
were fully immunized.
That's bad, but there are places like that.
Now, it's not because the vaccines are not there --
they are there and they are free --
and it's not because parents do not care about their kids.
The same child that is not immunized against measles,
if they do get measles, parents will spend
thousands of rupees to help them.
So you get these empty village subcenters
and crowded hospitals.
So what is the problem?
Well, part of the problem, surely, is people do not fully understand.
After all, in this country as well,
all sorts of myths and misconceptions
go around immunization.
So if that's the case, that's difficult,
because persuasion is really difficult.
But maybe there is another problem as well.
It's going from intention to action.
Imagine you are a mother
in Udaipur District, Rajasthan.
You have to walk a few kilometers to get your kids immunized.
And maybe when you get there, what you find is this:
The subcenter is closed. Ao you have to come back,
and you are so busy and you have so many other things to do,
you will always tend to postpone and postpone,
and eventually it gets too late.
Well, if that's the problem, then that's much easier.
Because A, we can make it easy,
and B, we can maybe
give people a reason to act today,
rather than wait till tomorrow.
So let's try them.
So what we did is we did a randomized, controlled trial
in 134 villages in Udaipur Districts.
So the blue dots
are selected randomly.
We made it easy -- I'll tell you how in a moment.
In the red dots, we made it easy
and gave people a reason to act now.
The white dots are comparisons, nothing changed.
So we make it easy by organizing
this monthly camp where people can
get their kids immunized.
And then you make it easy
and give a reason to act now
by adding a kilo of lentils for each immunization.
Now, a kilo of lentils is tiny.
It's never going to convince anybody
to do something that they don't want to do.
On the other hand, if your problem is you tend to postpone,
then it might give you a reason to act today
rather than later.
Well, beforehand, everything is the same.
That's the beauty of randomization.
Afterwards,
the camp -- just having the camp --
increases immunization from six percent to 17 percent.
That's full immunization.
That's not bad, that's a good improvement.
Add the lentils and you reach to 38 percent.
So here you've got your answer.
Make it easy and give a kilo of lentils,
you multiply immunization rate by six.
Now, you might say, "Well, but it's not sustainable.
We cannot keep giving lentils to people."
Well, it turns out it's wrong economics,
because it is cheaper
to give lentils than not to give them.
Since you have to pay for the nurse anyway,
the cost per immunization
ends up being cheaper if you give incentives than if you don't.
Should you give them for free, or should you ask people to pay for them?
So the answer hinges
on the answer to three simple questions.
One is: If people must pay for a bed net,
are they going to purchase them?
The second one is:
If I give bed nets for free,
are people going to use them?
And the third one is:
Do free bed nets discourage future purchase?
The third one is important
because if we think people get used to handouts,
it might destroy markets to distribute free bed nets.
Now this is a debate that has generated
a lot of emotion and angry rhetoric.
It's more ideological than practical,
but it turns out it's an easy question.
We can know the answer to this question.
We can just run an experiment.
And many experiments have been run, and they all have the same results,
so I'm just going to talk to you about one.
they went around and distributed to people
vouchers, discount vouchers.
So people with their voucher
could get the bed net in the local pharmacy.
And some people get 100 percent discount,
and some people get 20 percent discounts,
and some people get 50 percent discount, etc.
And now we can see what happens.
So, how about the purchasing?
Well, what you can see is that
when people have to pay for their bed nets,
the coverage rate really falls down a lot.
So even with partial subsidy,
three dollars is still not the full cost of a bed net,
and now you only have 20 percent of the people with the bed nets,
you lose the health immunity, that's not great.
Second thing is, how about the use?
Well, the good news is, people, if they have the bed nets,
will use the bed nets regardless of how they got it.
If they get it for free, they use it.
If they have to pay for it, they use it.
How about the long term?
In the long term,
people who got the free bed nets,
one year later, were offered the option
to purchase a bed net at two dollars.
And people who got the free one
were actually more likely to purchase the second one
than people who didn't get a free one.
So people do not get used to handouts; they get used to nets.
Maybe we need to give them a little bit more credit.
You know how to immunize kids, you know how to give bed nets."
But what politicians need is a range of options.
They need to know: Out of all the things I could do,
what is the best way to achieve my goals?
So suppose your goal is to get kids into school.
There are so many things you could do. You could pay for uniforms,
you could eliminate fees, you could build latrines,
you could give girls sanitary pads, etc., etc.
So what's the best?
Well, at some level, we think
all of these things should work.
So, is that sufficient? If we think they should work intuitively,
should we go for them?
Well, in business, that's certainly not the way we would go about it.
transporting goods.
Before the canals were invented
in Britain before the Industrial Revolution,
goods used to go on horse carts.
And then canals were built,
and with the same horseman and the same horse,
you could carry ten times as much cargo.
So should they have continued
to carry the goods on the horse carts, on the ground,
that they would eventually get there?
Well, if that had been the case,
there would have been no Industrial Revolution.
So why shouldn't we do the same with social policy?
In technology, we spend so much time
experimenting, fine-tuning,
getting the absolute cheapest way to do something,
so why aren't we doing that with social policy?
is answer a simple question.
Suppose you have 100 dollars to spend
on various interventions.
How many extra years of education
do you get for your hundred dollars?
Now I'm going to show you
what we get with various education interventions.
So the first ones are if you want the usual suspects,
hire teachers, school meals,
school uniforms, scholarships.
And that's not bad. For your hundred dollars,
you get between one and three extra years of education.
Things that don't work so well is bribing parents,
just because so many kids are already going to school
that you end up spending a lot of money.
And here are the most surprising results.
Tell people the benefits of education,
that's very cheap to do.
So for every hundred dollars you spend doing that,
you get 40 extra years of education.
And, in places where there are worms,
intestinal worms,
cure the kids of their worms.
And for every hundred dollars,
you get almost 30 extra years of education.
So this is not your intuition,
this is not what people would have gone for,
and yet, these are the programs that work.
We need that kind of information, we need more of it,
and then we need to guide policy.
And I cut it into smaller questions,
and I have the answer to these smaller questions.
And they are good, scientific, robust answers.
In Haiti, about 200,000 people died --
actually, a bit more by the latest estimate.
And the response of the world was great:
Two billion dollars got pledged just last month,
so that's about 10,000 dollars per death.
That doesn't sound like that much when you think about it.
But if we were willing to spend 10,000 dollars
for every child under five who dies,
that would be 90 billion per year
just for that problem.
And yet it doesn't happen.
So, why is that?
Well, I think what part of the problem is that,
in Haiti, although the problem is huge,
somehow we understand it, it's localized.
You give your money to Doctors Without Borders,
you give your money to Partners In Health,
and they'll send in the doctors, and they'll send in the lumber,
and they'll helicopter things out and in.
And the problem of poverty is not like that.
So, first, it's mostly invisible;
second, it's huge;
and third, we don't know whether we are doing the right thing.
There's no silver bullet.
You cannot helicopter people out of poverty.
And that's very frustrating.
I gave you three simple answers to three questions:
Give lentils to immunize people,
provide free bed nets, deworm children.
With immunization or bed nets,
you can save a life for 300 dollars per life saved.
With deworming, you can get
an extra year of education for three dollars.
So we cannot eradicate poverty just yet,
but we can get started.
And maybe we can get started small
with things that we know are effective.
Deworming.
Worms have a little bit of a problem grabbing the headlines.
They are not beautiful and don't kill anybody.
And yet, when the young global leader in Davos
showed the numbers I gave you,
they started Deworm the World.
And thanks to Deworm the World,
and the effort of many country governments and foundations,
20 million school-aged children got dewormed in 2009.
So this evidence is powerful.
It can prompt action.
It's not going to be easy.
It's a very slow process.
You have to keep experimenting, and sometimes ideology
has to be trumped by practicality.
And sometimes what works somewhere doesn't work elsewhere.
So it's a slow process,
but there is no other way.
These economics I'm proposing,
it's like 20th century medicine.
It's a slow, deliberative process
of discovery.
There is no miracle cure,
but modern medicine is saving
millions of lives every year,
and we can do the same thing.
that I started with at the beginning.
I cannot tell you
whether the aid we have spent in the past has made a difference,
but can we come back here in 30 years
and say, "What we have done,
it really prompted a change for the better."
I believe we can and I hope we will.
If you go on the TED website,
you can currently find there
over a full week of TEDTalk videos,
over 1.3 million
words of transcripts
and millions of user ratings.
And that's a huge amount of data.
And it got me wondering:
If you took all this data
and put it through statistical analysis,
could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?
Could you create
the ultimate TEDTalk?
(Laughter) (Applause)
And also, could you create
the worst possible TEDTalk
that they would still let you get away with?
I looked at the topic that you should choose,
I looked at how you should deliver it
and the visuals onstage.
Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,
but you should choose wisely,
because your topic strongly correlates
with how users will react to your talk.
Now, to make this more concrete,
let's look at the list of top 10 words
that statistically stick out
in the most favorite TEDTalks
and in the least favorite TEDTalks.
So if you came here
to talk about how French coffee
will spread happiness in our brains,
that's a go.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Whereas, if you wanted to talk about
your project involving
oxygen, girls, aircraft --
actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)
but statistics say it's not so good.
Oh, well.
If you generalize this,
the most favorite TEDTalks are those
that feature topics we can connect with,
both easily and deeply,
such as happiness, our own body,
food, emotions.
And the more technical topics,
such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,
those are not good topics to talk about.
TED is famous for keeping
a very sharp eye on the clock,
so they're going to hate me
for revealing this, because, actually,
you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)
Because the most favorite TEDTalks
are, on average, over 50 percent longer
than the least favorite ones.
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com
except if you want to have a talk
that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.
Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,
talk until they drag you off the stage.
(Applause)
While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics
of four-word phrases
that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks
as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.
I'll give you three examples.
First of all, I must, as a speaker,
provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,
instead of saying what I can't have.
Secondly, it's imperative
that you do not cite The New York Times.
(Laughter)
And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --
to fake intellectual capacity.
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."
You'll all stay with me.
It's perfectly fine.
(Applause)
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.
And analysis shows if you want to be
among the most favorite TED speakers,
you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,
make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up
than the average TED speaker.
Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.
And now the most important thing,
that is the mood onstage.
Color plays a very important role.
Color closely correlates
with the ratings that talks get on the website.
(Applause)
For example, fascinating talks
contain a statistically high amount
of exactly this blue color, (Laughter)
much more than the average TEDTalk.
Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,
etc., et.
(Laughter) (Applause)
Now, personally, I think
I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,
but I'll leave this
to your good judgment.
and design the ultimate TEDTalk.
Now, since this is TEDActive,
and I learned from my analysis
that I should actually give you something,
I will not impose the ultimate
or worst TEDTalk on you,
but rather give you a tool to create your own.
And I call this tool the TEDPad.
(Laughter)
And the TEDPad is a matrix
of 100 specifically selected,
highly curated sentences
that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.
You only have to make one decision,
and that is: Are you going to use the white version
for very good TEDTalks,
about creativity, human genius?
Or are you going to go with a black version,
which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,
mostly about blogs,
politics and stuff?
So, download it and have fun with it.
I hope you enjoy designing your own
ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year
to create this, which I really want to see.
Hi, my name is Roz Savage
and I row across oceans.
Four years ago, I rowed solo across the Atlantic,
and since then, I've done two out of three stages
across the Pacific,
from San Francisco to Hawaii
and from Hawaii to Kiribati.
And tomorrow, I'll be leaving this boat
to fly back to Kiribati
to continue with the third and final stage
of my row across the Pacific.
Cumulatively, I will have rowed
over 8,000 miles,
taken over three million oar strokes
and spent more than 312 days alone
on the ocean on a 23 foot rowboat.
This has given me a very
special relationship with the ocean.
We have a bit of a love/hate thing going on.
I feel a bit about it like I did about
a very strict math teacher that I once had at school.
I didn't always like her, but I did respect her,
and she taught me a heck of a lot.
So today I'd like to share with you
some of my ocean adventures
and tell you a little bit about what they've taught me,
and how I think we can maybe take some of those lessons
and apply them to this environmental challenge
that we face right now.
"Hold on a minute. She doesn't look very much like an ocean rower.
Isn't she meant to be about this tall
and about this wide
and maybe look a bit more like these guys?"
You'll notice, they've all got something that I don't.
Well, I don't know what you're thinking, but I'm talking about the beards. (Laughter)
And no matter how long I've spent on the ocean,
I haven't yet managed to muster a decent beard,
and I hope that it remains that way.
The story that I told myself was
that adventurers looked like this.
I didn't look the part.
I thought there were them and there were us,
and I was not one of them.
So for 11 years, I conformed.
I did what people from my kind of background were supposed to do.
I was working in an office in London
as a management consultant.
And I think I knew from day one that it wasn't the right job for me.
But that kind of conditioning
just kept me there for so many years,
until I reached my mid-30s and I thought,
"You know, I'm not getting any younger.
I feel like I've got a purpose in this life, and I don't know what it is,
but I'm pretty certain that management consultancy is not it.
I'd gone through some changes.
To try and answer that question of,
"What am I supposed to be doing with my life?"
I sat down one day
and wrote two versions of my own obituary,
the one that I wanted, a life of adventure,
and the one that I was actually heading for
which was a nice, normal, pleasant life,
but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life.
I wanted to live a life that I could be proud of.
And I remember looking at these two versions of my obituary
and thinking, "Oh boy,
I'm on totally the wrong track here.
If I carry on living as I am now,
I'm just not going to end up where I want to be
in five years, or 10 years,
or at the end of my life."
I made a few changes,
let go of some loose trappings of my old life,
and through a bit of a leap of logic,
decided to row across the Atlantic Ocean.
it's about 3,000 miles,
and it turned out to be
the hardest thing I had ever done.
Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone,
but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that
getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition,
extremely uncomfortable.
And my timing was not great either:
2005, when I did the Atlantic,
was the year of Hurricane Katrina.
There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic
than ever before, since records began.
And pretty early on,
those storms started making their presence known.
before I reached halfway across.
Oars are not supposed to look like this.
But what can you do? You're in the middle of the ocean.
Oars are your only means of propulsion.
So I just had to look around the boat
and figure out what I was going to use
to fix up these oars so that I could carry on.
So I found a boat hook and my trusty duct tape
and splintered the boat hook
to the oars to reinforce it.
Then, when that gave out,
I sawed the wheel axles off my spare rowing seat
and used those.
And then when those gave out, I cannibalized one of the broken oars.
I'd never been very good at fixing stuff
when I was living my old life,
but it's amazing how resourceful you can become
when you're in the middle of the ocean
and there's only one way to get to the other side.
of just in how many ways
I went beyond what I thought were my limits.
I suffered from tendinitis on my shoulders
and saltwater sores on my bottom.
I really struggled psychologically,
totally overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge,
realizing that, if I carried on moving at two miles an hour,
3,000 miles was going to
take me a very, very long time.
There were so many times
when I thought I'd hit that limit,
but had no choice but to just carry on
and try and figure out how I was going to get to the other side
without driving myself crazy.
103 days at sea,
I arrived in Antigua.
I don't think I've ever felt so happy
in my entire life.
It was a bit like finishing a marathon
and getting out of solitary confinement
and winning an Oscar all rolled into one.
I was euphoric.
And to see all the people coming out to greet me
and standing along the cliff tops and clapping and cheering,
I just felt like a movie star.
It was absolutely wonderful.
And I really learned then that, the bigger the challenge,
the bigger the sense of achievement
when you get to the end of it.
to answer a few FAQs about ocean rowing
that might be going through your mind.
Number one that I get asked: What do you eat?
A few freeze-dried meals, but mostly I try and eat
much more unprocessed foods.
So I grow my own beansprouts.
I eat fruits and nut bars,
a lot of nuts.
And generally arrive about 30 pounds lighter
at the other end.
Question number two: How do you sleep?
With my eyes shut. Ha-ha.
I suppose what you mean is:
What happens to the boat while I'm sleeping?
Well, I plan my route so that I'm drifting
with the winds and the currents while I'm sleeping.
On a good night, I think my best ever was 11 miles
in the right direction.
Worst ever, 13 miles in the wrong direction.
That's a bad day at the office.
What do I wear?
Mostly, a baseball cap,
rowing gloves and a smile -- or a frown,
depending on whether I went backwards overnight --
and lots of sun lotion.
Do I have a chase boat?
No I don't. I'm totally self-supporting out there.
I don't see anybody for the whole time
that I'm at sea, generally.
And finally: Am I crazy?
Well, I leave that one up to you to judge.
Well, naturally, you decide to row across the Pacific.
Well, I thought the Atlantic was big,
but the Pacific is really, really big.
I think we tend to do it a little bit of a disservice in our usual maps.
I don't know for sure that the Brits
invented this particular view of the world, but I suspect we might have done so:
we are right in the middle,
and we've cut the Pacific in half
and flung it to the far corners of the world.
Whereas if you look in Google Earth,
this is how the Pacific looks.
It pretty much covers half the planet.
You can just see a little bit of North America up here
and a sliver of Australia down there.
It is really big --
65 million square miles --
and to row in a straight line across it
would be about 8,000 miles.
Unfortunately, ocean rowboats
very rarely go in a straight line.
By the time I get to Australia,
if I get to Australia,
I will have rowed probably nine or 10,000 miles in all.
straight past Hawaii without dropping in,
I decided to cut this very big undertaking
into three segments.
The first attempt didn't go so well.
In 2007, I did a rather involuntary capsize drill
three times in 24 hours.
A bit like being in a washing machine.
Boat got a bit dinged up,
so did I.
I blogged about it. Unfortunately, somebody
with a bit of a hero complex decided that
this damsel was in distress and needed saving.
The first I knew about this was when the Coast Guard plane turned up overhead.
I tried to tell them to go away.
We had a bit of a battle of wills.
I lost and got airlifted.
Awful, really awful.
It was one of the worst feelings of my life,
as I was lifted up on that winch line into the helicopter
and looked down at my trusty little boat
rolling around in the 20 foot waves
and wondering if I would ever see her again.
So I had to launch a very expensive
salvage operation
and then wait another nine months
before I could get back out onto the ocean again.
Fall down nine times, get up 10.
So, the following year, I set out
and, fortunately, this time made it safely across to Hawaii.
But it was not without misadventure.
My watermaker broke,
only the most important piece of kit that I have on the boat.
Powered by my solar panels,
it sucks in saltwater
and turns it into freshwater.
But it doesn't react very well to being immersed in ocean,
which is what happened to it.
Fortunately, help was at hand.
at the same time, doing as I was doing,
bringing awareness to the North Pacific Garbage Patch,
that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas,
with an estimated 3.5 million
tons of trash in it,
circulating at the center of
that North Pacific Gyre.
So, to make the point, these guys
had actually built their boat out of plastic trash,
15,000 empty water bottles
latched together into two pontoons.
They were going very slowly.
Partly, they'd had a bit of a delay.
They'd had to pull in at Catalina Island shortly after they left Long Beach
because the lids of all the water bottles were coming undone,
and they were starting to sink.
So they'd had to pull in and do all the lids up.
luckily, our courses were converging.
They were running out of food; I was running out of water.
So we liaised by satellite phone and arranged to meet up.
And it took about a week
for us to actually gradually converge.
I was doing a pathetically slow speed
of about 1.3 knots,
and they were doing only marginally less pathetic speed of about 1.4:
it was like two snails in a mating dance.
But, eventually, we did manage to meet up
and Joel hopped overboard,
caught us a beautiful, big mahi-mahi,
which was the best food I'd had
in, ooh, at least three months.
was better than this one they caught a few weeks earlier.
When they opened this one up,
they found its stomach was full of plastic.
And this is really bad news because plastic
is not an inert substance.
It leaches out chemicals
into the flesh of the poor critter that ate it,
and then we come along and eat that poor critter,
and we get some of the toxins accumulating
in our bodies as well.
So there are very real implications for human health.
And, the following year, set out
on the second stage of the Pacific,
from Hawaii down to Tarawa.
And you'll notice something about Tarawa;
it is very low-lying.
It's that little green sliver on the horizon,
which makes them very nervous
about rising oceans.
This is big trouble for these guys.
They've got no points of land more than about six feet above sea level.
And also, as an increase in extreme
weather events due to climate change,
they're expecting more waves
to come in over the fringing reef,
which will contaminate their fresh water supply.
I had a meeting with the president there,
who told me about his
exit strategy for his country.
He expects that within the next 50 years,
the 100,000 people that live there
will have to relocate to
New Zealand or Australia.
And that made me think about how would I feel
if Britain was going to disappear under the waves;
if the places where I'd been born
and gone to school
and got married,
if all those places were just going to disappear forever.
How, literally, ungrounded
that would make me feel.
and if I'm successful, I'll be the first woman ever to row solo
all the way across the Pacific.
And I try to use this to bring awareness to these environmental issues,
to bring a human face to the ocean.
If the Atlantic was about my inner journey,
discovering my own capabilities,
maybe the Pacific has been about my outer journey,
figuring out how I can use
my interesting career choice
to be of service to the world,
and to take some of those things that I've learned out there
and apply them to the situation
that humankind now finds itself in.
The first one is about
the stories that we tell ourselves.
For so long, I told myself
that I couldn't have an adventure
because I wasn't six foot tall
and athletic and bearded.
And then that story changed.
I found out that people had rowed across oceans.
I even met one of them and she was just about my size.
So even though I didn't grow any taller,
I didn't sprout a beard,
something had changed: My interior dialogue had changed.
At the moment, the story that we collectively tell ourselves
is that we need all this stuff,
that we need oil.
But what about if we just change that story?
We do have alternatives,
and we have the power of free will
to choose those alternatives, those sustainable ones,
to create a greener future.
the accumulation of tiny actions.
We might think that anything that we do as an individual
is just a drop in the ocean, that it can't really make a difference.
But it does. Generally, we haven't
got ourselves into this mess through big disasters.
Yes, there have been the Exxon Valdezes
and the Chernobyls,
but mostly it's been an accumulation
of bad decisions
by billions of individuals,
day after day and year after year.
And, by the same token, we can turn that tide.
We can start making better,
wiser, more sustainable decisions.
And when we do that, we're not just one person.
Anything that we do spreads ripples.
Other people will see if you're in the supermarket line
and you pull out your
reusable grocery bag.
Maybe if we all start doing this,
we can make it socially unacceptable
to say yes to plastic in the checkout line.
That's just one example.
This is a world-wide community.
It's about taking responsibility.
For so much of my life,
I wanted something else to make me happy.
I thought if I had the right house or the right car
or the right man in my life,
then I could be happy.
But when I wrote that obituary exercise,
I actually grew up a little bit in that moment
and realized that I needed to create my own future.
I couldn't just wait passively
for happiness to come and find me.
And I suppose I'm a selfish environmentalist.
I plan on being around for a long time,
and when I'm 90 years old,
I want to be happy and healthy.
And it's very difficult to be happy
on a planet that's racked
with famine and drought.
It's very difficult to be healthy on a planet
where we've poisoned the earth
and the sea and the air.
launching a new initiative
called Eco-Heroes.
And the idea here is that
all our Eco-Heroes will log at least one green deed every day.
It's meant to be a bit of a game.
We're going to make an iPhone app out of it.
We just want to try and create that awareness
because, sure, changing a light bulb isn't going to change the world,
but that attitude,
that awareness that leads you to change the light bulb
or take your reusable coffee mug,
that is what could change the world.
at a very important point in history.
We have a choice. We've been blessed,
or cursed, with free will.
We can choose a greener future,
and we can get there
if we all pull together to take it one stroke at a time.
Most of the talks
that you've heard in the last several fabulous days
have been from people who have the characteristic
that they have thought about something,
they are experts, they know what's going on.
All of you know about the topic
that I'm supposed to talk about.
That is, you know what simplicity is,
you know what complexity is.
The trouble is, I don't.
And what I'm going to do is share with you
my ignorance on this subject.
because we're going to come back to it in a moment.
The quote is from
the fabled Potter Stewart
opinion on pornography.
And let me just read it,
the important details here:
"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];
and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.
But I know it when I see it."
I'm going to come back to that in a moment.
It's good to start with some examples.
A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,
but it's much more interesting than one might think --
a coffee cup is a device,
which has a container and a handle.
The handle enables you to hold it
when the container is filled with hot liquid.
Why is that important?
Well, it enables you to drink coffee.
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,
the liquid is sterile;
you're not likely to get cholera that way.
So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,
is one of the tools used by society
to maintain public health.
Scissors are your clothes,
glasses enable you to see things
and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs
or run down by automobiles,
and books are, after all, your education.
which are also very important.
Simple in function,
but not at all simple in how they're constructed.
And the two here are just examples.
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.
And it rests on a complexity,
which has some characteristics
very different from those that my friend
Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,
but are very interesting.
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,
which, in a very simple way,
fundamentally changed the structure of society
by changing the role of women in it
by providing to them
the opportunity to make reproductive choices.
And here I've corrupted
the Potter Stewart quotation
by saying that we can think about something --
which spans all the way from scissors
to the cell phone,
Internet and birth control pills --
by saying that they're simple,
the functions are simple,
and we recognize what that simplicity is
when we see it.
which is to think about the problem in terms of what --
if you associate with moral philosophers --
is called the teapot problem.
The teapot problem I'll pose this way.
Suppose you see a teapot,
and the teapot is
filled with hot water.
And you then ask the question:
Why is the water hot?
And that's a simple question.
It's like, what is simplicity?
One answer would be:
because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high
and they bounce against things rapidly --
that's a kind of physical science argument.
A second argument would be:
because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --
that's an historical argument.
A third is that I wanted hot water
for tea --
that's an intentional argument.
And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,
the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.
All of these are possibilities.
when you ask a single question
with a single box for an answer,
in which that single question actually is many questions
with quite different meanings,
but with the same words.
Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.
What is the state of science?
And, interestingly, complexity
is very highly evolved.
We have a lot of interesting information
about what complexity is.
Simplicity, for reasons
that are a little bit obscure,
is almost not pursued,
at least in the academic world.
we love complexity.
You can write papers about complexity,
and the nice thing about complexity is
it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,
so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)
Simplicity -- all of you really would like
your Waring Blender in the morning
to make whatever a Waring Blender does,
but not explode or play Beethoven.
You're not interested in the limits of these things.
So what one is interested in
has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.
And there's a lot of rewards in thinking
about complexity and emergence,
not so much in thinking about simplicity.
One of the things I want to do
is to help you with a very important task --
which you may not know that you have very often --
which is to understand
how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party
and have a conversation. (Laughter)
And the words that I would like you to focus on
are complexity and emergence,
because these will enable you to start the conversation
and then daydream about other things.
and what is emergence?
We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.
It is a system, like traffic,
which has components.
The components interact with one another.
These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.
It turns out that, whenever you have that system,
weird stuff happens,
and you in Los Angeles
probably know this better than anyone.
Here's another example,
which I put up because
it's an example of really important current science.
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,
but that's a tiny part
of the chemical reactions going on
in each of your cells at any given moment.
And it's like the traffic that you see.
The amazing thing about the cell is that
it actually does maintain a fairly stable
working relationship with other cells,
but we don't know why.
Anyone who tells you that we understand life,
walk away.
We've heard from Bill Gates recently.
All of us, to some extent, study
this thing called a Bill Gates.
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.
And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,
and you study that hard.
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.
But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,
and you put them together,
what can you say about this combination?
The answer is, not a lot.
And that's complexity.
Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,
and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.
of simplicity
of a particular kind.
And I want to introduce a word
that I think is very useful,
which is stacking.
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity
that has the characteristic
that it is so simple
and so reliable
that I can build things with it.
Or I'm going to use simple to mean
reliable, predictable, repeatable.
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,
because it's a particularly good example
of stacked simplicity.
We call it a complex system, which it is,
but it's also something else.
it starts with binary.
And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,
we are familiar with the Arabic numbers
one to 10 and so on.
In binary, one is 0001,
seven is 0111.
The question is: Why is binary
simpler than Arabic?
And the answer is, simply,
that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,
but if I hold up this,
it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.
The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way
of representing numbers.
Anything else is more complicated.
You can catch errors with it,
it's unambiguous in its reading,
there are lots of good things about binary.
So it is very, very simple
once you learn how to read it.
Now, if you like to represent
this zero and one of binary,
you need a device.
And think of things in your life
that are binary,
one of them is light switches.
They can be on and off. That's binary.
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists
managed to come up, some 50 years ago,
with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,
which is a transistor.
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.
It turns things on and off,
but it does so without moving parts
and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.
So the second layer of simplicity
was the transistor in the Internet.
So, since the transistor is so simple,
you can put lots of them together.
And you put lots of them together and you come with
something called integrated circuits.
And a current integrated circuit
might have in each one of these chips
something like a billion transistors,
all of which have to work perfectly every time.
So that's the next layer of simplicity,
and, in fact, integrated circuits
are really simple in the sense that they,
in general, work really well.
You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work
the large majority of the time.
In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia
in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)
so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,
but some of the time.
But, in fact, if you have cell phones,
you can now go to this nice lady
who's somewhere like Namibia,
and who is extremely happy with the fact
that although she does not have
an master's degree in
electrical engineering from MIT,
she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone
to get power in some funny way.
And from that comes the Internet.
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.
The two blobs that are light in the middle there
are the United States and Europe.
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,
which is Google.
Which, in this simple portal
makes the claim
that it makes accessible
all of the world's information.
But the point is that
that extraordinary simple idea
rests on layers of simplicity
each compounded into a complexity
that is itself simple,
in the sense that it is completely reliable.
with four general statements,
an example and two aphorisms.
The characteristics, which I think
are useful to think about for simple things:
First, they are predictable.
Their behavior is predictable.
Now, one of the nice characteristics
of simple things
is you know what it's going to do, in general.
So simplicity and predictability
are characteristics of simple things.
The second is, and this is a real world statement,
they're cheap.
If you have things that are cheap enough,
people will find uses for them,
even if they seem very primitive.
So, for example, stones.
You can build cathedrals out of stones,
you just have to know what it does.
You carve them in blocks and then you
pile them on top of one another,
and they support weight.
and the cost has to be low.
What that means is
that you have to have a high performance
or value for cost.
And then I would propose
as this last component
that they serve, or have the potential to serve,
as building blocks.
That is, you can stack them.
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,
or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.
But if you have something that has a function,
and it's really cheap,
people will find new ways of putting it together
to make new things.
Cheap, functional, reliable things
unleash the creativity of people
who then build stuff that you could not imagine.
There's no way of predicting the Internet
based on the first transistor.
It just is not possible.
So these are the components.
is something that I want to give you
from the work that we ourselves do.
We are very interested in
delivering health care in the developing world,
and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business
is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis
at as close to zero cost
as we can manage.
So, how does one do that?
This is a world in which there's no electricity,
there's no money, there's no medical competence.
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,
but in the lower right-hand corner,
you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.
It's a little paper chip.
It has a few things printed on it
using the same technology
that you use for making comic books,
which was the inspiration for this particular idea.
And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.
It wicks its way up into these little branches.
You know, no power required.
It turns colors. In this particular case,
you're reading kidney function.
And, since the health care worker
of much of this part of the world
is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,
who happens to be out of work and is willing
to go around and do this sort of thing,
he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,
send the picture back to where there is a doctor,
and the doctor can look at it.
which is available everywhere,
make a device, which is extremely cheap,
and make it in such a fashion
that it is very, very reliable.
If we can pull this off,
if we can build more function,
it will be stackable.
That is to say, if we can make the basic technology
of one or two things work,
it will be applicable to a very, very
large variety of human conditions,
and hence, extendable in both
vertical and horizontal directions.
Part of my interest in this, I have to say,
is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --
change the way, or maybe eviscerate,
the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,
which I think is fundamentally broken.
(Applause)
One of them is from Mr. Einstein,
and he says, "Everything should be made
as simple as possible, but not simpler."
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.
If you take too much out
of something that's simple, you lose function.
You have to have low cost,
but you also have to have a function.
So you can't make it too simple.
And the second is a design issue,
and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,
not when you have nothing more to add,
but when you have nothing more to take away."
And that certainly is going in the right direction.
So, what I think one can begin to do
with this kind of
cut at the word simplicity,
which doesn't cover Brancusi,
it doesn't answer the question of
why Mondrian is better or worse
or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,
and certainly doesn't address the question
of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.
which is one which, in a sense,
differentiates the real world of people who make things,
and the world of people who think about things,
which is, there is an intellectual merit
to asking: How do we make things
as simple as we can,
as cheap as we can, as functional as we can
and as freely interconnectable as we can?
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology
and then give it to you guys,
you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.
So can you picture
that a science of simplicity
might get to the point where
you could look out at various systems --
say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,
"That has got to the point of danger
or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,
and this is how we might simplify it"?
at the components from which the system is made
and examine their fragility, or their stability,
you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of
radical solution on the cost side,
but in terms of the system itself?
How do I put that simply? No.
that diagnostic technology that you've got,
where is that, and when do you see that
maybe getting rolled out to scale.
and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,
but the basic technology works.
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit.
So I want to talk today about an idea. It's a big idea.
Actually, I think it'll eventually
be seen as probably the single biggest idea
that's emerged in the past century.
It's the idea of computation.
Now, of course, that idea has brought us
all of the computer technology we have today and so on.
But there's actually a lot more to computation than that.
It's really a very deep, very powerful, very fundamental idea,
whose effects we've only just begun to see.
working on three large projects
that really try to take the idea of computation seriously.
So I started off at a young age as a physicist
using computers as tools.
Then, I started drilling down,
thinking about the computations I might want to do,
trying to figure out what primitives they could be built up from
and how they could be automated as much as possible.
Eventually, I created a whole structure
based on symbolic programming and so on
that let me build Mathematica.
And for the past 23 years, at an increasing rate,
we've been pouring more and more ideas
and capabilities and so on into Mathematica,
and I'm happy to say that that's led to many good things
in R & D and education,
lots of other areas.
Well, I have to admit, actually,
that I also had a very selfish reason for building Mathematica:
I wanted to use it myself,
a bit like Galileo got to use his telescope
400 years ago.
But I wanted to look not at the astronomical universe,
but at the computational universe.
complicated things that we build
for very specific purposes.
But what about the space of all possible programs?
Here's a representation of a really simple program.
So, if we run this program,
this is what we get.
Very simple.
So let's try changing the rule
for this program a little bit.
Now we get another result,
still very simple.
Try changing it again.
You get something a little bit more complicated.
But if we keep running this for a while,
we find out that although the pattern we get is very intricate,
it has a very regular structure.
So the question is: Can anything else happen?
Well, we can do a little experiment.
Let's just do a little mathematical experiment, try and find out.
of the particular type that we're looking at.
They're called cellular automata.
You can see a lot of diversity in the behavior here.
Most of them do very simple things,
but if you look along all these different pictures,
at rule number 30,
you start to see something interesting going on.
So let's take a closer look
at rule number 30 here.
So here it is.
We're just following this very simple rule at the bottom here,
but we're getting all this amazing stuff.
It's not at all what we're used to,
and I must say that, when I first saw this,
it came as a huge shock to my intuition.
And, in fact, to understand it,
I eventually had to create
a whole new kind of science.
than the mathematics-based science that we've had
for the past 300 or so years.
You know, it's always seemed like a big mystery:
how nature, seemingly so effortlessly,
manages to produce so much
that seems to us so complex.
Well, I think we've found its secret:
It's just sampling what's out there in the computational universe
and quite often getting things like Rule 30
or like this.
And knowing that starts to explain
a lot of long-standing mysteries in science.
It also brings up new issues, though,
like computational irreducibility.
I mean, we're used to having science let us predict things,
but something like this
is fundamentally irreducible.
The only way to find its outcome
is, effectively, just to watch it evolve.
It's connected to, what I call,
the principle of computational equivalence,
which tells us that even incredibly simple systems
can do computations as sophisticated as anything.
It doesn't take lots of technology or biological evolution
to be able to do arbitrary computation;
just something that happens, naturally,
all over the place.
Things with rules as simple as these can do it.
Well, this has deep implications
about the limits of science,
about predictability and controllability
of things like biological processes or economies,
about intelligence in the universe,
about questions like free will
and about creating technology.
I kept wondering,
"What will be its first killer app?"
Well, ever since I was a kid,
I'd been thinking about systematizing knowledge
and somehow making it computable.
People like Leibniz had wondered about that too
300 years earlier.
But I'd always assumed that to make progress,
I'd essentially have to replicate a whole brain.
Well, then I got to thinking:
This scientific paradigm of mine suggests something different --
and, by the way, I've now got
huge computation capabilities in Mathematica,
and I'm a CEO with some worldly resources
to do large, seemingly crazy, projects --
So I decided to just try to see
how much of the systematic knowledge that's out there in the world
we could make computable.
which I was not sure was going to work at all.
But I'm happy to say it's actually going really well.
And last year we were able
to release the first website version
of Wolfram Alpha.
Its purpose is to be a serious knowledge engine
that computes answers to questions.
So let's give it a try.
Let's start off with something really easy.
Hope for the best.
Very good. Okay.
So far so good.
(Laughter)
Let's try something a little bit harder.
Let's do
some mathy thing,
and with luck it'll work out the answer
and try and tell us some interesting things
things about related math.
We could ask it something about the real world.
Let's say -- I don't know --
what's the GDP of Spain?
And it should be able to tell us that.
Now we could compute something related to this,
let's say ... the GDP of Spain
divided by, I don't know,
the -- hmmm ...
let's say the revenue of Microsoft.
this kind of question in, however we think of it.
So let's try asking a question,
like a health related question.
So let's say we have a lab finding that ...
you know, we have an LDL level of 140
for a male aged 50.
So let's type that in, and now Wolfram Alpha
will go and use available public health data
and try and figure out
what part of the population that corresponds to and so on.
Or let's try asking about, I don't know,
the International Space Station.
Wolfram Alpha is not just looking up something;
it's computing, in real time,
where the International Space Station is right now at this moment,
how fast it's going, and so on.
So Wolfram Alpha knows about lots and lots of kinds of things.
It's got, by now,
pretty good coverage of everything you might find
in a standard reference library.
But the goal is to go much further
and, very broadly, to democratize
all of this knowledge,
and to try and be an authoritative
source in all areas.
To be able to compute answers to specific questions that people have,
not by searching what other people
may have written down before,
but by using built in knowledge
to compute fresh new answers to specific questions.
is a monumentally huge, long-term project
with lots and lots of challenges.
For a start, one has to curate a zillion
different sources of facts and data,
and we built quite a pipeline of Mathematica automation
and human domain experts for doing this.
But that's just the beginning.
Given raw facts or data
to actually answer questions,
one has to compute:
one has to implement all those methods and models
and algorithms and so on
that science and other areas have built up over the centuries.
Well, even starting from Mathematica,
this is still a huge amount of work.
So far, there are about 8 million lines
of Mathematica code in Wolfram Alpha
built by experts from many, many different fields.
is that you can just ask it questions
using ordinary human language,
which means that we've got to be able to take
all those strange utterances that people type into the input field
and understand them.
And I must say that I thought that step
might just be plain impossible.
Two big things happened:
First, a bunch of new ideas about linguistics
that came from studying the computational universe;
and second, the realization that having actual computable knowledge
completely changes how one can
set about understanding language.
And, of course, now
with Wolfram Alpha actually out in the wild,
we can learn from its actual usage.
And, in fact, there's been
an interesting coevolution that's been going on
between Wolfram Alpha
and its human users,
and it's really encouraging.
Right now, if we look at web queries,
more than 80 percent of them get handled successfully the first time.
And if you look at things like the iPhone app,
the fraction is considerably larger.
So, I'm pretty pleased with it all.
we're still at the very beginning with Wolfram Alpha.
I mean, everything is scaling up very nicely
and we're getting more confident.
You can expect to see Wolfram Alpha technology
showing up in more and more places,
working both with this kind of public data, like on the website,
and with private knowledge
for people and companies and so on.
You know, I've realized that Wolfram Alpha actually gives one
a whole new kind of computing
that one can call knowledge-based computing,
in which one's starting not just from raw computation,
but from a vast amount of built-in knowledge.
And when one does that, one really changes
the economics of delivering computational things,
whether it's on the web or elsewhere.
On the one hand, we have Mathematica,
with its sort of precise, formal language
and a huge network
of carefully designed capabilities
able to get a lot done in just a few lines.
Let me show you a couple of examples here.
So here's a trivial piece of Mathematica programming.
Here's something where we're sort of
integrating a bunch of different capabilities here.
Here we'll just create, in this line,
a little user interface that allows us to
do something fun there.
If you go on, that's a slightly more complicated program
that's now doing all sorts of algorithmic things
and creating user interface and so on.
But it's something that is very precise stuff.
It's a precise specification with a precise formal language
that causes Mathematica to know what to do here.
with all the messiness of the world
and human language and so on built into it.
So what happens when you put these things together?
I think it's actually rather wonderful.
With Wolfram Alpha inside Mathematica,
you can, for example, make precise programs
that call on real world data.
Here's a real simple example.
You can also just sort of give vague input
and then try and have Wolfram Alpha
figure out what you're talking about.
Let's try this here.
But actually I think the most exciting thing about this
is that it really gives one the chance
to democratize programming.
I mean, anyone will be able to say what they want in plain language.
Then, the idea is that Wolfram Alpha will be able to figure out
what precise pieces of code
can do what they're asking for
and then show them examples that will let them pick what they need
to build up bigger and bigger, precise programs.
So, sometimes, Wolfram Alpha
will be able to do the whole thing immediately
and just give back a whole big program that you can then compute with.
Here's a big website
where we've been collecting lots of educational
and other demonstrations about lots of kinds of things.
I'll show you one example here.
This is just an example of one of these computable documents.
This is probably a fairly small
piece of Mathematica code
that's able to be run here.
So, given our new kind of science,
is there a general way to use it to make technology?
So, with physical materials,
we're used to going around the world
and discovering that particular materials
are useful for particular
technological purposes.
Well, it turns out we can do very much the same kind of thing
in the computational universe.
There's an inexhaustible supply of programs out there.
The challenge is to see how to
harness them for human purposes.
Something like Rule 30, for example,
turns out to be a really good randomness generator.
Other simple programs are good models
for processes in the natural or social world.
And, for example, Wolfram Alpha and Mathematica
are actually now full of algorithms
that we discovered by searching the computational universe.
And, for example, this -- if we go back here --
this has become surprisingly popular
among composers
finding musical forms by searching the computational universe.
In a sense, we can use the computational universe
to get mass customized creativity.
I'm hoping we can, for example,
use that even to get Wolfram Alpha
to routinely do invention and discovery on the fly,
and to find all sorts of wonderful stuff
that no engineer
and no process of incremental evolution would ever come up with.
Could it be that someplace out there in the computational universe
we might find our physical universe?
Perhaps there's even some quite simple rule,
some simple program for our universe.
Well, the history of physics would have us believe
that the rule for the universe must be pretty complicated.
But in the computational universe,
we've now seen how rules that are incredibly simple
can produce incredibly rich and complex behavior.
So could that be what's going on with our whole universe?
If the rules for the universe are simple,
it's kind of inevitable that they have to be
very abstract and very low level;
operating, for example, far below
the level of space or time,
which makes it hard to represent things.
But in at least a large class of cases,
one can think of the universe as being
like some kind of network,
which, when it gets big enough,
behaves like continuous space
in much the same way as having lots of molecules
can behave like a continuous fluid.
Well, then the universe has to evolve by applying
little rules that progressively update this network.
And each possible rule, in a sense,
corresponds to a candidate universe.
but here are a few of the candidate universes
that I've looked at.
Some of these are hopeless universes,
completely sterile,
with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space,
no notion of time, no matter,
other problems like that.
But the exciting thing that I've found in the last few years
is that you actually don't have to go very far
in the computational universe
before you start finding candidate universes
that aren't obviously not our universe.
Here's the problem:
Any serious candidate for our universe
is inevitably full of computational irreducibility.
Which means that it is irreducibly difficult
to find out how it will really behave,
and whether it matches our physical universe.
A few years ago, I was pretty excited to discover
that there are candidate universes with incredibly simple rules
that successfully reproduce special relativity,
and even general relativity and gravitation,
and at least give hints of quantum mechanics.
So, will we find the whole of physics?
I don't know for sure,
but I think at this point it's sort of
almost embarrassing not to at least try.
One's got to build a lot of technology.
One's got to build a structure that's probably
at least as deep as existing physics.
And I'm not sure what the best way to organize the whole thing is.
Build a team, open it up, offer prizes and so on.
But I'll tell you, here today,
that I'm committed to seeing this project done,
to see if, within this decade,
we can finally hold in our hands
the rule for our universe
and know where our universe lies
in the space of all possible universes ...
and be able to type into Wolfram Alpha, "the theory of the universe,"
and have it tell us.
now for more than 30 years,
building tools and methods and turning intellectual ideas
into millions of lines of code
and grist for server farms and so on.
With every passing year,
I realize how much more powerful
the idea of computation really is.
It's taken us a long way already,
but there's so much more to come.
From the foundations of science
to the limits of technology
to the very definition of the human condition,
I think computation is destined to be
the defining idea of our future.
Stay here. I've got a question.
Are you able to say in a sentence or two
how this type of thinking
could integrate at some point
to things like string theory or the kind of things that people think of
as the fundamental explanations of the universe?
that we kind of know to be true,
things like the standard model of physics:
what I'm trying to do better reproduce the standard model of physics
or it's simply wrong.
The things that people have tried to do in the last 25 years or so
with string theory and so on
have been an interesting exploration
that has tried to get back to the standard model,
but hasn't quite gotten there.
My guess is that some great simplifications of what I'm doing
may actually have considerable resonance
with what's been done in string theory,
but that's a complicated math thing
that I don't yet know how it's going to work out.
He also has shown how complexity
can arise out of a simple start.
Does your work relate to his?
I view Benoit Mandelbrot's work
as one of the founding contributions
to this kind of area.
Benoit has been particularly interested
in nested patterns, in fractals and so on,
where the structure is something
that's kind of tree-like,
and where there's sort of a big branch that makes little branches
and even smaller branches and so on.
That's one of the ways
that you get towards true complexity.
I think things like the Rule 30 cellular automaton
get us to a different level.
In fact, in a very precise way, they get us to a different level
because they seem to be things that are
capable of complexity
that's sort of as great as complexity can ever get ...
I believe that there are new, hidden tensions
that are actually happening between people and institutions --
institutions that are the institutions that people
inhabit in their daily life:
schools, hospitals, workplaces,
factories, offices, etc.
is something that I would like to call
a sort of "democratization of intimacy."
And what do I mean by that?
I mean that what people are doing
is, in fact, they are sort of, with their communication channels,
they are breaking an imposed isolation
that these institutions are imposing on them.
in a very simple way, by calling their mom from work,
by IMing from their office to their friends,
by texting under the desk.
The pictures that you're seeing behind me
are people that I visited in the last few months.
And I asked them to come along with the person they communicate with most.
And somebody brought a boyfriend, somebody a father.
One young woman brought her grandfather.
For 20 years, I've been looking at how people use
channels such as email, the mobile phone, texting, etc.
What we're actually going to see is that, fundamentally,
people are communicating on a regular basis
with five, six, seven of their most intimate sphere.
Recently some sociologists from Facebook --
Facebook is the channel that you would expect
is the most enlargening of all channels.
And an average user,
said Cameron Marlow,
from Facebook, has about 120 friends.
But he actually talks to,
has two-way exchanges with, about four to six people
on a regular base, depending on his gender.
Academic research on instant messaging
also shows 100 people on buddy lists,
but fundamentally people chat with two, three, four --
anyway, less than five.
My own research on cellphones and voice calls
shows that 80 percent of the calls
are actually made to four people. 80 percent.
And when you go to Skype, it's down to two people.
A lot of sociologists actually are quite disappointed.
I mean, I've been a bit disappointed sometimes
when I saw this data and all this deployment, just for five people.
And some sociologists actually feel that
it's a closure, it's a cocooning,
that we're disengaging from the public.
And I would actually, I would like to show you that
if we actually look at who is doing it,
and from where they're doing it,
actually there is an incredible social transformation.
The first gentleman, he's a baker.
And so he starts working every morning at four o'clock in the morning.
And around eight o'clock he sort of sneaks away from his oven,
cleans his hands from the flour
and calls his wife.
He just wants to wish her a good day, because that's the start of her day.
And I've heard this story a number of times.
A young factory worker who works night shifts,
who manages to sneak away from the factory floor,
where there is CCTV by the way,
and find a corner, where at 11 o'clock at night
he can call his girlfriend and just say goodnight.
Or a mother who, at four o'clock,
suddenly manages to find a corner in the toilet
to check that her children are safely home.
They've lived in Italy for a number of years.
They Skype with their families a few times a week.
But once a fortnight, they actually put the computer on their dining table,
pull out the webcam and actually have dinner
with their family in Sao Paulo. And they have a big event of it.
And I heard this story the first time a couple of years ago
from a very modest family
of immigrants from Kosovo in Switzerland.
They had set up a big screen in their living room,
and every morning they had breakfast with their grandmother.
But Danny Miller, who is a very good anthropologist
who is working on Filipina migrant women
who leave their children back in the Philippines,
was telling me about how much parenting is going on
through Skype,
and how much these mothers are engaged with their children through Skype.
They chat to each other every day, a few times a day actually.
And finally, finally, they've managed to put
instant messaging on their computers at work.
And now, obviously, they have it open.
Whenever they have a moment they chat to each other.
And this is exactly what we've been seeing
with teenagers and kids doing it in school, under the table,
and texting under the table to their friends.
So, none of these cases are unique.
I mean, I could tell you hundreds of them.
So, think of the three settings I've talked to you about:
factory, migration, office.
But it could be in a school, it could be an administration,
it could be a hospital.
Three settings that, if we just step back 15 years,
if you just think back 15 years,
when you clocked in,
when you clocked in to an office,
when you clocked in to a factory,
there was no contact for the whole duration of the time,
there was no contact with your private sphere.
If you were lucky there was a public phone hanging in the corridor or somewhere.
If you were in management, oh, that was a different story.
Maybe you had a direct line.
If you were not, you maybe had to go through an operator.
But basically, when you walked into those buildings,
the private sphere was left behind you.
such a norm and such an expectation.
And it had nothing to do with technical capability.
The phones were there. But the expectation was once you moved in there
your commitment was fully to the task at hand,
fully to the people around you.
That was where the focus had to be.
And this has become such a cultural norm
that we actually school our children for them to be capable to do this cleavage.
If you think nursery, kindergarten, first years of school
are just dedicated to take away the children,
to make them used to staying long hours away from their family.
It mimics perfectly all the rituals that we will find in offices:
rituals of entry, rituals of exit,
the schedules, the uniforms in this country,
things that identify you, team-building activities,
team building that will allow you to basically
be with a random group of kids, or a random group of people
that you will have to be with for a number of time.
And of course, the major thing:
learn to pay attention,
to concentrate and focus your attention.
This only started about 150 years ago.
It only started with the birth of modern bureaucracy,
and of industrial revolution.
When people basically had to go somewhere else to work
and carry out the work.
And when with modern bureaucracy there was a very rational approach,
where there was a clear distinction between the private sphere
and the public sphere.
They were living on top of the land they were laboring.
They were living on top of the workshops where they were working.
And if you think, it's permeated our whole culture,
even our cities.
If you think of medieval cities, medieval cities the boroughs
all have the names of the guilds and professions that lived there.
Now we have sprawling residential suburbias
that are well distinct from production areas
and commercial areas.
there has been a very clear class system that also has emerged.
So the lower the status of the job
and of the person carrying out, the more removed
he would be from his personal sphere.
People have taken this amazing possibility
of actually being in contact all through the day
or in all types of situations.
And they are doing it massively.
The Pew Institute, which produces good data
on a regular basis on, for instance, in the States,
says that -- and I think that this number is conservative --
50 percent of anybody with email access at work
is actually doing private email from his office.
I really think that the number is conservative.
In my own research, we saw that the peak for private email
is actually 11 o'clock in the morning, whatever the country.
75 percent of people admit doing private
conversations from work on their mobile phones.
100 percent are using text.
is not terribly successful with all institutions.
I'm always surprised the U.S. Army
sociologists are discussing of the impact
for instance, of soldiers in Iraq
having daily contact with their families.
But there are many institutions that are actually blocking this access.
And every day, every single day,
I read news that makes me cringe,
like a $15 fine
to kids in Texas,
for using, every time they take out their mobile phone in school.
Immediate dismissal to bus drivers in New York,
if seen with a mobile phone in a hand.
Companies blocking access to IM or to Facebook.
which have always been the arguments for social control,
in fact what is going on is that
these institutions are trying to decide
who, in fact, has a right to self determine their attention,
to decide, whether they should, or not, be isolated.
And they are actually trying to block, in a certain sense,
this movement of a greater possibility of intimacy.
Salaam. Namaskar.
Good morning.
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting
that I'm going to speak to you about
the latest philanthropic trends --
the one that's currently got Wall Street
and the World Bank buzzing --
how to invest in women,
how to empower them, how to save them.
I am interested in how women
are saving us.
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining
a future that defies and blurs
accepted polarities,
polarities we've taken for granted for a long time,
like the ones between modernity and tradition,
oppression and opportunity.
In the midst of the daunting challenges
we face as a global community,
there's something about
this third way raga
that is making my heart sing.
What intrigues me most
is how women are doing this,
despite a set of paradoxes
that are both frustrating and fascinating.
viciously oppressed by cultural practices,
and yet at the same time,
are the preservers of cultures in most societies?
Is the hijab or the headscarf
a symbol of submission
or resistance?
When so many women and girls
are beaten, raped, maimed
on a daily basis
in the name of all kinds of causes --
honor, religion, nationality --
what allows women to replant trees,
to rebuild societies,
to lead radical, non-violent movements
for social change?
Is it different women
who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?
at the TED conference in Oxford,
of assuming that there is a single story
of women's struggles for their rights
while there are, in fact, many?
And what, if anything,
do men have to do with it?
to get some answers to these questions.
It's taken me across the globe
and introduced me to some amazing people.
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments
that help me shed some light on this puzzle.
Among those who've helped open my eyes
to a third way
are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,
a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia
and a taboo breaker in Liberia.
I'm indebted to them,
as I am to my parents,
who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,
were blessed with three daughters in this one.
And for reasons equally unclear to me,
seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.
and I learned from an early age
to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles
who would bend down, pat us on the head
and then say to my parents
with no problem at all,
"Poor things. You only have three daughters.
But you're young, you could still try again."
My sense of outrage
was brought to a boil when I was about 11.
My aunt, an incredibly articulate
and brilliant woman,
was widowed early.
A flock of relatives descended on her.
They took off her colorful sari.
They made her wear a white one.
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.
They broke her bangles.
Her daughter, Rani,
a few years older than me,
sat in her lap bewildered,
not knowing what had happened
to the confident woman
she once knew as her mother.
Late that night, I heard my mother
begging my father,
"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"
"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.
This is tradition."
That's the night I learned the rules
Women don't make those rules,
but they define us, and they define
our opportunities and our chances.
And men are affected by those rules too.
could not save his own sister
under the excellent tutelage of my mother,
I was therefore, as you might expect,
defiantly feminist.
On the streets chanting,
"[Hindi]
[Hindi]
We are the women of India.
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995,
it was clear to me, the only way
to achieve gender equality
was to overturn centuries
of oppressive tradition.
Soon after I returned from Beijing,
I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,
founded by women,
But barely six months into my new job,
I met a woman
who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.
at a time when no one knew
where Afghanistan was in the United States.
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."
She was the most determined advocate
for women's rights I had ever heard.
She told me women were running underground schools
in her communities inside Afghanistan,
and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,
had started a school in Pakistan.
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows
is that the Koran requires
and strongly supports literacy.
The prophet wanted every believer
to be able to read the Koran for themselves."
Had I heard right?
Was a women's rights advocate
invoking religion?
But Sakena defies labels.
She always wears a headscarf,
but I've walked alongside with her on a beach
with her long hair flying in the breeze.
She starts every lecture with a prayer,
but she's a single, feisty,
financially independent woman
in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,
"give me the freedom to do what I need to do
to speak to those whose support and assistance
are critical for this work.
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp,
I went to see the imam.
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children
in these terrible conditions
need their faith to survive.'"
She smiles slyly.
"He was flattered.
He began to come twice a week to my center
because women could not go to the mosque.
And after he would leave,
women and girls would stay behind.
We began with a small literacy class
to read the Koran,
then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp
was in our classes."
Sakena is a teacher
at a time when to educate women
is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.
Look at those young girls who go back to school
when acid is thrown in their face."
And I smile, and I nod,
realizing I'm watching women and girls
using their own religious traditions and practices,
turning them into instruments
of opposition and opportunity.
Their path is their own
and it looks towards an Afghanistan
that will be different.
of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia
know all too well.
To be a lesbian, a dyke,
a homosexual
in most parts of the world, including right here
in our country, India,
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort
and extreme prejudice.
In post-conflict societies like Croatia,
where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity
have created an environment unbearable
for anyone who might
be considered a social outcast.
So enter a group of out dykes,
young women who love the old music
that once spread across that region
from Macedonia to Bosnia,
from Serbia to Slovenia.
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.
Many have struggled to come out to their communities,
in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept
that their daughters are not sick,
just queer.
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,
"I like traditional music very much.
I also like rock and roll.
So Lesbor, we blend the two.
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,
in which people can really speak their voice,
especially traditional songs
from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.
After the war, lots of these songs were lost,
but they are a part of our childhood and our history,
and we should not forget them."
has demonstrated how women
are investing in tradition to create change,
like alchemists turning discord into harmony.
Their repertoire includes
the Croatian national anthem,
a Bosnian love song
and Serbian duets.
And, Leah adds with a grin,
"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,
because it shows we are open to religious practices
even though Catholic Church
hates us LGBT."
Their concerts draw from
their own communities, yes,
but also from an older generation:
a generation that might be
suspicious of homosexuality,
but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter
coming out in such a choir,
now writes songs for them.
In the Middle Ages, troubadours
would travel across the land
singing their tales and sharing their verses:
Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this,
singing, connecting people divided
by religion, nationality and language.
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs
and Lesbor reminds them that
the songs one group often claims as theirs alone
really belong to them all.
that music can create a world
more accepting of difference
than the one we have been given.
The world Leymah Gbowee was given
was a world at war.
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.
Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.
But she was sick with worry:
She worried her son would be abducted
and taken off to be a child soldier,
she worried her daughters would be raped,
she worried for their lives.
One night, she had a dream.
She dreamt she and thousands of other women
ended the bloodshed.
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.
They were all tired of the fighting.
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know
we will not rest until there is peace.
Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.
She promised to raise the issue with her community.
the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque
began to share their distress at the state of affairs.
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish
between a Muslim and a Christian."
This small group of women,
determined to bring an end to the war,
and they chose to use their traditions to make a point:
Liberian women usually wear
lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.
But no, for the protest, they dressed
all in white, no makeup.
As Leymah said, "We wore the white
saying we were out for peace."
They stood on the side of the road on which
Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.
They stood for weeks --
first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women --
wearing white, singing, dancing,
saying they were out for peace.
were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.
Leymah and her sisters had had enough.
With their remaining funds, they took
a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks
and they surrounded the building.
In a now famous CNN clip,
you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].
Then things get tense.
The police are called in to physically remove the women.
As the senior officer approaches with a baton,
Leymah stands up with deliberation,
reaches her arms up over her head,
and begins, very slowly,
to untie her headdress that covers her hair.
You can see the policeman's face.
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.
And the next thing you know,
the police have disappeared.
Leymah said to me later,
"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.
If an older woman undresses in front of a man
because she wants to,
the man's family is cursed."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,
but he knew we were not going to leave.
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."
And the women of Liberia
then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,
a woman who broke a few taboos herself
becoming the first elected woman head of state
in Africa in years.
When she made her presidential address,
she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia
who allowed her to win against a football star --
that's soccer for you Americans --
no less.
and Leymah
have humbled me and changed me
and made me realize that I should not be so quick
to jump to assumptions of any kind.
They've also saved me from my righteous anger
by offering insights into this third way.
A Filipina activist once said to me,
"How do you cook a rice cake?
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."
The protests, the marches,
the uncompromising position that
women's rights are human rights, full stop.
That's the heat from the bottom.
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists
and gay pride parades.
But we also need the heat from the top.
And in most parts of the world,
that top is still
controlled by men.
but not in circumstances of their own choosing.
They have to negotiate.
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them
in order to give voice to new aspirations.
And they need allies from their communities.
Allies like the imam,
allies like the father who now writes songs
for a lesbian group in Croatia,
allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,
allies like my father,
who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters
pursue their dreams.
Maybe this is because feminism,
unlike almost every other social movement,
is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --
it's not the ruling class
or the occupiers or the colonizers --
it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions
that we women, far too often,
hold ourselves.
that the personal is in fact the political.
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,
the same is true of gender equality:
that it starts in small places, close to home.
On the streets, yes,
but also in negotiations at the kitchen table
and in the marital bed
and in relationships between lovers and parents
and sisters and friends.
And then
you realize that by integrating
aspects of tradition and community
into their struggles,
women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah --
but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India
and Michelle Bachelet in Chile
and Shirin Ebadi in Iran --
are doing something else.
They're challenging the very notion
of Western models of development.
They are saying, we don't have to be like you
to make change.
We can wear a sari or a hijab
or pants or a boubou,
and we can be party leaders and presidents
and human rights lawyers.
We can use our tradition to navigate change.
We can demilitarize societies
and pour resources, instead,
into reservoirs of genuine security.
these individual stories,
that I see a radical epic being written
by women around the world.
It is in these threads
that are being woven into a resilient fabric
that will sustain communities,
that I find hope.
And if my heart is singing,
it's because in these little fragments,
every now and again, you catch a glimpse
of a whole, of a whole new world.
And she is definitely on her way.
One of the things that
defines a TEDster
is you've taken your passion,
and you've turned it into stewardship.
You actually put action to the issues you care about.
But what you're going to find eventually is
you may need to actually get elected officials
to help you out.
So, how do you do that?
I worked for the Discovery Channel early in my career,
and that sort of warped my framework.
So, when you start to think about politicians,
you've got to realize these are strange creatures.
Other than the fact that they can't tell directions,
and they have very strange breeding habits,
how do you actually work with these things? (Laughter)
What we need to understand is:
What drives the political creature?
And there are two things that are primary in a politician's heart:
One is reputation and influence.
These are the primary tools by which
a politician can do his job.
The second one -- unlike most animals,
which is survival of the species --
this is preservation of self.
Now you may think it's money,
but that's actually sort of a proxy
to what I can do to preserve myself.
is these animals are getting broadcast to all the time.
So, what doesn't work, in terms of getting your issue to be important?
You can send them an email.
Well, unfortunately, I've got so many
Viagra ads coming at me,
your email is lost.
It doesn't matter, it's spam.
How about you get on the phone?
Well, chances are I've got a droid who's picking up the phone,
"Yes, they called, and they said they didn't like it."
That doesn't move.
Face to face would work,
but it's hard to set it up.
It's hard to get the context and actually get the communication to work.
Yes, contributions actually do make a difference
and they set a context for having a conversation,
but it takes some time to build up.
And the answer is rather strange.
It's a letter.
We live in a digital world,
but we're fairly analog creatures.
Letters actually work.
Even the top dog himself
takes time every day to read 10 letters
that are picked out by staff.
I can tell you that every official that I've ever worked with
will tell you about the letters they get
and what they mean.
So, how are you going to write your letter?
First of all, you're going to pick up an analog device: a pen.
I know these are tough, and you may have a hard time
getting your hand bent around it, (Laughter)
but this is actually critical.
And it is critical that
you actually handwrite your letter.
It is so novel to see this,
that somebody actually picked up an analog device
and has written to me.
Second of all, I'm going to recommend that
you get into a proactive stance
and write to your elected officials at least once a month.
Here's my promise to you:
If you are consistent and do this,
within three months the elected official will start calling you
when that issue comes up and say, "What do you think?"
a four paragraph format to work with.
Now, when you approach these animals,
you need to understand there's a dangerous end to them,
and you also need to approach them
with some level of respect and a little bit of wariness.
So in paragraph number one,
what I'm going to tell you to do is very simply this:
You appreciate them.
You may not appreciate the person, you may not appreciate anything else,
but maybe you appreciate the fact that they've got a tough gig.
When animals are going to make a point, they make the point.
They don't spend a lot of time dicking around.
So, here you go. (Laughter)
Paragraph number two:
You may actually have to just get very blunt
and say what's really on your mind.
When you do this,
don't attack people;
you attack tactics.
Ad hominem attacks will get you nowhere.
Paragraph number three:
When animals are attacked or cornered,
they will fight to the death,
so you have to give them an exit.
Most of the time, if they have an exit strategy, they should take it.
"Obviously, you're intelligent.
If you had the right information,
you would have done the right thing." (Laughter)
Lastly, you want to be the nurturing agent.
You're the safe place to come in to.
So, in paragraph number four,
you're going to tell people,
"If no one is providing you with this information, let me help." (Laughter)
They warn you or they try to attract you
and say, "We need to mate."
You're going to do that by the way you sign your letter.
You do a number of things: you're a vice president,
you volunteer, you do something else.
Why is is this important?
Because this establishes the two
primary criteria for the political creature:
that you have influence in a large sphere,
and that my preservation depends on you.
especially for the feds in the audience.
Here's how you mail your letter.
First of all, you send the original to the district office.
So, you send the copy to the main office.
If they follow protocol, they'll pick up the phone and say, "Hey, do you have the original?"
Then some droid in the back puts the name on a tickler
and says, "Oh, this is an important letter."
And you actually get into the folder
that the elected official actually has to read.
I've got to tell you, we are all in a party,
and political officials are the pinatas.
(Laughter)
We are harangued, lectured to,
sold, marketed,
but a letter is actually one of the few times
that we have honest communication.
I got this letter when I was first elected,
and I still carry it to
every council meeting I go to.
This is an opportunity at real dialogue,
and if you have stewardship
and want to communicate,
that dialogue is incredibly powerful.
So when you do that, here's what I can promise:
You're going to be the 800 pound gorilla in the forest.
In the spirit of Jacques Cousteau, who said,
"People protect what they love,"
I want to share with you today what I love most in the ocean,
and that's the incredible number and variety
of animals in it that make light.
that's not an acronym -- just somebody thought it looked like the insect.
It was actually developed for use by the offshore oil industry
for diving on oil rigs down to a depth of 2,000 feet.
Right after I completed my Ph.D.,
I was lucky enough to be included with a group of scientists
that was using it for the first time
as a tool for ocean exploration.
We trained in a tank in Port Hueneme,
and then my first open ocean dive
was in Santa Barbara Channel.
It was an evening dive.
I went down to a depth of 880 feet
and turned out the lights.
And the reason I turned out the lights is because I knew I would see
this phenomenon of animals making light
called bioluminescence.
But I was totally unprepared
for how much there was
and how spectacular it was.
I saw chains of jellyfish called siphonophores
that were longer than this room,
pumping out so much light
that I could read the dials and gauges
inside the suit without a flashlight;
and puffs and billows
of what looked like luminous blue smoke;
and explosions of sparks
that would swirl up out of the thrusters --
just like when you throw a log on a campfire and the embers swirl up off the campfire,
but these were icy, blue embers.
It was breathtaking.
it's these guys; it's fireflies.
And there are a few other land-dwellers that can make light --
some insects, earthworms, fungi --
but in general, on land, it's really rare.
In the ocean, it's the rule
rather than the exception.
If I go out in the open ocean environment,
virtually anywhere in the world,
and I drag a net from 3,000 feet to the surface,
most of the animals --
in fact, in many places, 80 to 90 percent
of the animals that I bring up in that net --
that I shot from a submersible.
I first developed this technique working from a little
single-person submersible called Deep Rover
and then adapted it for use on the Johnson Sea-Link,
which you see here.
So, mounted in front of the observation sphere,
there's a a three-foot diameter hoop
with a screen stretched across it.
And inside the sphere with me is an intensified camera
that's about as sensitive as a fully dark-adapted human eye,
albeit a little fuzzy.
So you turn on the camera, turn out the lights.
That sparkle you're seeing is not luminescence,
that's just electronic noise
begins to move forward through the water,
but as it does, animals bumping into the screen
are stimulated to bioluminesce.
all I was trying to do was count the numbers of sources.
I knew my forward speed, I knew the area,
and so I could figure out how many hundreds of sources
there were per cubic meter.
But I started to realize that I could actually identify animals
by the type of flashes they produced.
And so, here, in the Gulf of Maine
at 740 feet,
I can name pretty much everything you're seeing there to the species level.
Like those big explosions, sparks,
are from a little comb jelly,
and there's krill and other kinds of crustaceans,
and jellyfish.
There was another one of those comb jellies.
And so I've worked with computer image analysis engineers
to develop automatic recognition systems
that can identify these animals
and then extract the XYZ coordinate of the initial impact point.
And we can then do the kinds of things that ecologists do on land,
and do nearest neighbor distances.
to see a light show like this.
You can actually see it in surface waters.
This is some shot, by Dr. Mike Latz at Scripps Institution,
of a dolphin swimming through bioluminescent plankton.
And this isn't someplace exotic
like one of the bioluminescent bays in Puerto Rico,
this was actually shot in San Diego Harbor.
And sometimes you can see it even closer than that,
because the heads on ships --
that's toilets, for any land lovers that are listening --
are flushed with unfiltered seawater
that often has bioluminescent plankton in it.
So, if you stagger into the head late at night
and you're so toilet-hugging sick
that you forget to turn on the light,
Well, that was the question that 19th century
French physiologist Raphael Dubois,
asked about this bioluminescent clam.
He ground it up and he managed to get out a couple of chemicals;
one, the enzyme, he called luciferase;
the substrate, he called luciferin
after Lucifer the Lightbearer.
That terminology has stuck, but it doesn't actually refer to specific chemicals
because these chemicals come in a lot of different shapes and forms.
In fact, most of the people
studying bioluminescence today
are focused on the chemistry, because these chemicals
have proved so incredibly valuable
for developing antibacterial agents,
cancer fighting drugs,
testing for the presence of life on Mars,
detecting pollutants in our waters --
which is how we use it at ORCA.
In 2008,
the Nobel Prize in Chemistry
was awarded for work done
on a molecule called green fluorescent protein
that was isolated from the bioluminescent chemistry
of a jellyfish,
and it's been equated to the invention of the microscope,
in terms of the impact that it has had
on cell biology and genetic engineering.
that, apparently, bioluminescence has evolved
at least 40 times, maybe as many as 50 separate times
in evolutionary history,
which is a clear indication
of how spectacularly important
this trait is for survival.
So, what is it about bioluminescence
that's so important to so many animals?
Well, for animals that are trying to avoid predators
by staying in the darkness,
light can still be very useful
for the three basic things that animals have to do to survive:
and that's find food,
attract a mate and avoid being eaten.
So, for example, this fish
has a built-in headlight behind its eye
that it can use for finding food
or attracting a mate.
And then when it's not using it, it actually can roll it down into its head
just like the headlights on your Lamborghini.
This fish actually has high beams.
has three headlights on each side of its head.
Now, this one is blue,
and that's the color of most bioluminescence in the ocean
because evolution has selected
for the color that travels farthest through seawater
in order to optimize communication.
So, most animals make blue light,
and most animals can only see blue light,
but this fish is a really fascinating exception
because it has two red light organs.
And I have no idea why there's two,
and that's something I want to solve some day --
but not only can it see blue light,
but it can see red light.
So it uses its red bioluminescence like a sniper's scope
to be able to sneak up on animals
that are blind to red light
and be able to see them without being seen.
It's also got a little chin barbel here
with a blue luminescent lure on it
that it can use to attract prey from a long way off.
And a lot of animals will use their bioluminescence as a lure.
This is a viperfish, and it's got a lure
on the end of a long fishing rod
that it arches in front of the toothy jaw
that gives the viperfish its name.
The teeth on this fish are so long
that if they closed inside the mouth of the fish,
it would actually impale its own brain.
So instead, it slides in grooves
on the outside of the head.
This is a Christmas tree of a fish;
everything on this fish lights up,
it's not just that lure.
It's got a built-in flashlight.
It's got these jewel-like light organs on its belly
that it uses for a type of camouflage
that obliterates its shadow,
so when it's swimming around and there's a predator looking up from below,
it makes itself disappear.
It's got light organs in the mouth,
it's got light organs in every single scale, in the fins,
in a mucus layer on the back and the belly,
all used for different things --
some of which we know about, some of which we don't.
and I'm very grateful to Pixar for sharing
my favorite topic with so many people.
I do wish, with their budget,
that they might have spent just a tiny bit more money
to pay a consulting fee to some poor, starving graduate student,
who could have told them that those are the eyes
of a fish that's been preserved in formalin.
These are the eyes of a living anglerfish.
So, she's got a lure that she sticks out
in front of this living mousetrap
of needle-sharp teeth
in order to attract in some unsuspecting prey.
And this one has a lure
with all kinds of little interesting threads coming off it.
was to attract different types of prey,
but then stomach content analyses on these fish
done by scientists, or more likely their graduate students,
have revealed that
they all eat pretty much the same thing.
So, now we believe that the different shape of the lure
is how the male recognizes the female
in the anglerfish world,
because many of these males
are what are known as dwarf males.
This little guy
has no visible means of self-support.
He has no lure for attracting food
and no teeth for eating it when it gets there.
His only hope for existence on this planet
is as a gigolo. (Laughter)
He's got to find himself a babe
and then he's got to latch on for life.
So this little guy
has found himself this babe,
and you will note that he's had the good sense
to attach himself in a way that he doesn't actually have to look at her.
(Laughter)
But he still knows a good thing when he sees it,
and so he seals the relationship with an eternal kiss.
His flesh fuses with her flesh,
her bloodstream grows into his body,
and he becomes nothing more than a little sperm sac.
She always knows where he is,
and she doesn't have to be monogamous,
because some of these females
come up with multiple males attached.
They use it a lot for defense, many different ways.
A lot of them can release their luciferin or luferase in the water
just the way a squid or an octopus will release an ink cloud.
This shrimp is actually
spewing light out of its mouth
like a fire breathing dragon
in order to blind or distract this viperfish
so that the shrimp can swim away into the darkness.
And there are a lot of different animals that can do this:
There's jellyfish, there's squid,
there's a whole lot of different crustaceans,
This fish is called the shining tubeshoulder
because it actually has a tube on its shoulder
that can squirt out light.
And I was luck enough to capture one of these
when we were on a trawling expedition
off the northwest coast of Africa for "Blue Planet,"
for the deep portion of "Blue Planet."
And we were using a special trawling net
that we were able to bring these animals up alive.
So we captured one of these, and I brought it into the lab.
So I'm holding it,
and I'm about to touch that tube on its shoulder,
and when I do, you'll see bioluminescence coming out.
But to me, what's shocking
is not just the amount of light,
but the fact that it's not just luciferin and luciferase.
For this fish, it's actually whole cells
with nuclei and membranes.
It's energetically very costly for this fish to do this,
and we have no idea why it does it --
another one of these great mysteries that needs to be solved.
is something called a burglar alarm --
same reason you have a burglar alarm on your car;
the honking horn and flashing lights
are meant to attract the attention of, hopefully,
the police that will come and take the burglar away --
when an animal's caught in the clutches of a predator,
its only hope for escape may be
to attract the attention of something bigger and nastier
that will attack their attacker,
thereby affording them a chance for escape.
This jellyfish, for example, has
a spectacular bioluminescent display.
This is us chasing it in the submersible.
That's not luminescence, that's reflected light from the gonads.
We capture it in a very special device on the front of the submersible
that allows us to bring it up in really pristine condition,
bring it into the lab on the ship.
And then to generate the display you're about to see,
all I did was touch it once per second
on its nerve ring with a sharp pick
that's sort of like the sharp tooth of a fish.
And once this display gets going, I'm not touching it anymore.
This is an unbelievable light show.
It's this pinwheel of light,
and I've done calculations that show that this could be seen
from as much as 300 feet away by a predator.
And I thought, "You know,
that might actually make a pretty good lure."
Because one of the things that's frustrated me
as a deep-sea explorer
is how many animals there probably are in the ocean that we know nothing about
because of the way we explore the ocean.
is we go out and drag nets behind ships.
And I defy you to name any other branch of science
that still depends on hundreds of year-old technology.
The other primary way is we go down
with submersibles and remote-operated vehicles.
I've made hundreds of dives in submersibles.
When I'm sitting in a submersible though,
I know that I'm not unobtrusive at all --
I've got bright lights and noisy thrusters --
any animal with any sense is going to be long gone.
So, I've wanted for a long time
to figure out a different way to explore.
It's not exactly rocket science. We call this thing Eye-in-the-Sea.
And scientists have done this on land for years;
we just use a color that the animals can't see
and then a camera that can see that color.
You can't use infrared in the sea.
We use far-red light, but even that's a problem
because it gets absorbed so quickly.
Made an intensified camera,
wanted to make this electronic jellyfish.
Thing is, in science,
you basically have to tell the funding agencies what you're going to discover
before they'll give you the money.
And I didn't know what I was going to discover,
to actually do it as an undergraduate student project initially,
and then I kluged funding from a whole bunch of different sources.
gave me time with their ROV
so that I could test it and we could figure out,
you know, for example, which colors of red light we had to use
so that we could see the animals, but they couldn't see us --
get the electronic jellyfish working.
And you can see just what a shoestring operation this really was,
because we cast these 16 blue LEDs in epoxy
and you can see in the epoxy mold that we used,
the word Ziploc is still visible.
Needless to say, when it's kluged together like this,
there were a lot of trials and tribulations getting this working.
But there came a moment when it all came together,
and everything worked.
And, remarkably, that moment got caught on film
by photographer Mark Richards,
who happened to be there at the precise moment
that we discovered that it all came together.
That's me on the left,
my graduate student at the time, Erika Raymond,
and Lee Fry, who was the engineer on the project.
And we have this photograph posted in our lab in a place of honor
with the caption: "Engineer satisfying two women at once." (Laughter)
And we were very, very happy.
that we could actually take to some place
that was kind of like an oasis on the bottom of the ocean
that might be patrolled by large predators.
And so, the place that we took it to
was this place called a Brine Pool,
which is in the northern part of the Gulf of Mexico.
we had a crummy camera at the time --
but I was ecstatic.
We're at the edge of the Brine Pool,
there's a fish that's swimming towards the camera.
It's clearly undisturbed by us.
And I had my window into the deep sea.
I, for the first time, could see what animals were doing down there
when we weren't down there disturbing them in some way.
Four hours into the deployment,
we had programmed the electronic jellyfish
to come on for the first time.
Eighty-six seconds after
it went into its pinwheel display,
we recorded this:
This is a squid, over six feet long,
that is so new to science,
it cannot be placed in any known scientific family.
I could not have asked for a better proof of concept.
and said, "This is what we will discover."
And they gave me enough money to do it right,
which has involved developing the world's first deep-sea webcam --
which has been installed in
the Monterey Canyon for the past year --
and now, more recently,
a modular form of this system,
a much more mobile form
that's a lot easier to launch and recover,
that I hope can be used on Sylvia's "hope spots"
to help explore
and protect these areas,
and, for me, learn more about
the bioluminescence in these "hope spots."
is, there is still a lot to explore in the oceans.
And Sylvia has said
that we are destroying the oceans before we even know what's in them,
and she's right.
So if you ever, ever get an opportunity
to take a dive in a submersible,
say yes -- a thousand times, yes --
and please turn out the lights.
I promise, you'll love it.
The greatest irony in global health
is that the poorest countries
carry the largest disease burden.
If we resize the countries of the globe
in proportion to the subject of interest,
we see that Sub-Saharan Africa
is the worst hit region by HIV/AIDS.
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time.
We also see that this region
has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease.
There are very few doctors
and, quite frankly, these countries do not have the resources
that are needed to cope
with such epidemics.
developed countries, have generously done
is they have proposed to provide free drugs
to all people in Third World countries
who actually can't afford these medications.
And this has already saved millions of lives,
and it has prevented entire economies
from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa.
that is killing the efforts
in fighting this disease,
because if you keep throwing
drugs out at people
who don't have diagnostic services,
you end up creating a problem of drug resistance.
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa.
The problem is that,
what begins as a tragedy in the Third World
could easily become a global problem.
And the last thing we want to see
is drug-resistant strains of HIV
popping up all over the world,
because it will make treatment more expensive
and it could also restore
the pre-ARV carnage of HIV/AIDS.
as a high school student in Uganda.
This was in the 90s
during the peak of the HIV epidemic,
before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa.
And during that time, I actually lost more relatives,
as well as the teachers who taught me,
to HIV/AIDS.
So this became one of the driving passions of my life,
to help find real solutions
that could address these kinds of problems.
Back in the day, computers used to fill this entire room,
and people actually used to work inside the computers.
But what electronic miniaturization has done
is that it has allowed people to shrink
technology into a cell phone.
And I'm sure everyone here enjoys cell phones
that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world,
in the Third World countries.
The good news is that the same technology
that allowed miniaturization of electronics
is now allowing us to miniaturize
biological laboratories.
biological and chemistry laboratories
onto microfluidic chips.
I was very lucky to come
to the US right after high school,
and was able to work on this technology
and develop some devices.
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed.
A close look at how the technology works:
These are channels that are about the size of a human hair --
so you have integrated valves, pumps, mixers and injectors --
so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments
onto a microfluidic system.
is to actually take the current state
of the technology
and build an HIV kit
in a microfluidic system.
So, with one microfluidic chip,
which is the size of an iPhone,
you can actually diagnose
100 patients at the same time.
For each patient, we will be able to do
up to 100 different viral loads per patient.
And this is only done in four hours,
50 times faster than the current state of the art,
at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper
than the current options.
So this will allow us to create
personalized medicines in the Third World
at a cost that is actually achievable
and make the world a safer place.
as well as your involvement
in driving this vision
to a point of practical reality.
Good morning.
Happy to see so many fine folks out here
and so many smiling faces.
I have a very peculiar
background, attitude and approach
to the real world
because I am a conjurer.
Now, I prefer that term over magician,
because if I were a magician, that would mean
that I use spells and incantations
and weird gestures
in order to accomplish real magic.
No, I don't do that; I'm a conjurer,
who is someone who pretends to be
a real magician. (Laughter)
We depend on the fact
that audiences, such as yourselves,
will make assumptions.
For example, when I walked up here
and I took the microphone from the stand
and switched it on,
you assumed this was a microphone, which it is not.
(Laughter)
As a matter of fact, this is something
that about half of you, more than half of you will not be familiar with.
It's a beard trimmer, you see?
And it makes a very bad microphone;
I've tried it many times. (Laughter)
The other assumption that you made --
and this little lesson is to show you
that you will make assumptions.
Not only that you can, but that you will
when they are properly suggested to you.
You believe I'm looking at you.
Wrong. I'm not looking at you. I can't see you.
I know you're out there, they told me backstage, it's a full house and such.
I know you're there because I can hear you,
but I can't see you because I normally wear glasses.
These are not glasses, these are empty frames. (Laughter)
Quite empty frames.
wearing empty frames on his face?
To fool you, ladies and gentlemen,
to deceive you, to show that you, too,
can make assumptions.
Don't you ever forget that.
Now, I have to do something -- first of all, switch to real glasses
so I can actually see you,
which would probably be a convenience. I don't know.
I haven't had a good look. Well, it's not that great a convenience.
a little bit strange for a magician.
But I'm going to take some medication.
This is a full bottle of
Calms Forte.
I'll explain that in just a moment.
Ignore the instructions,
that's what the government has to put in there
to confuse you, I'm sure.
I will take enough of these. Mm.
Indeed, the whole container.
Thirty-two tablets of Calms Forte.
I must tell you that
I am an actor.
I'm an actor who plays a specific part.
I play the part of a magician,
a wizard, if you will, a real wizard.
If someone were to appear on this stage in front of me
and actually claim to be
an ancient prince of Denmark named Hamlet,
you would be insulted
and rightly so.
Why would a man assume that you would believe
something bizarre like this?
But there exists out there
a very large population
of people who will tell you
that they have psychic, magical powers
that they can predict the future,
that they can make contact with the deceased.
Oh, they also say
they will sell you astrology
or other fortunetelling methods.
Oh, they gladly sell you that, yes.
And they also say
that they can give you perpetual motion machines
and free energy systems.
They claim to be psychics,
or sensitives, whatever they can.
just recently
is this business of
speaking with the dead.
Now, to my innocent mind,
dead implies
incapable of communicating. (Laughter)
You might agree with me on that.
But these people, they tend to tell you that
not only can they communicate with the dead --
"Hi, there" --
but they can hear the dead as well,
and they can relay this information back to the living.
I wonder if that's true.
I don't think so, because
this subculture of people
use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do,
exactly the same --
the same physical methods, the same psychological methods --
and they effectively and profoundly
deceive millions of people around the earth,
to their detriment.
They deceive these people,
costs them a lot of money,
cost them a lot of emotional anguish.
Billions of dollars are spent
every year, all over the globe,
on these charlatans.
I would like to ask these people
if I had the opportunity to do so.
First question: If I want to ask them to call up --
because they do hear them through the ear.
They listen to the spirits like this --
I'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother
because, when she died, she had the family will,
and she secreted it someplace. We don't know where it is,
so we ask Granny, "Where is the will, Granny?"
What does Granny say? She says, "I'm in heaven and it's wonderful.
I'm here with all my old friends, my deceased friends,
and my family
and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that I used to have when I was a little girl.
And I love you, and I'll always be with you.
Good bye."
And she didn't answer the damn question!
Where is the will?
Now, she could easily have said,
"Oh, it's in the library on the second shelf, behind the encyclopedia,"
but she doesn't say that. No, she doesn't.
She doesn't bring any useful information to us.
We paid a lot of money for that information,
be we didn't get it.
Suppose I ask them to contact
the spirit of my deceased father-in-law, as an example.
Why do they insist on saying --
remember, they speak into this ear --
why do they say, "My name starts with J or M?"
Is this a hunting game?
Hunting and fishing? What is it?
Is it 20 questions? No, it's more like 120 questions.
But it is a cruel, vicious,
absolutely conscienceless --
I'll be all right, keep your seats (Laughter) --
game that these people play.
And they take advantage of the innocent, the naive,
the grieving, the needy people out there.
that is called cold reading.
There's one fellow out there,
Van Praagh is his name, James Van Praagh.
He's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing.
John Edward, Sylvia Browne
and Rosemary Altea, they are other operators.
There are hundreds of them all over the earth, but in this country,
James Van Praagh is very big.
And what does he do? He likes to tell you
how the deceased got deceased,
the people he's talking to through his ear, you see?
So what he says is, very often, is like this: he says,
"He tells me, he tells me, before he passed,
that he had trouble breathing."
Folks, that's what dying is all about!
(Laughter)
You stop breathing, and then you're dead.
It's that simple.
And that's the kind of information they're going to bring back to you?
I don't think so.
Now, these people will make guesses, they'll say things like,
"Why am I getting electricity?
He's saying to me, 'Electricity.'
Was he an electrician?" "No."
"Did he ever have an electric razor?" "No."
It was a game of hunting questions like this.
This is what they go through.
at the James Randi Educational Foundation,
they call me, they say, "Why are you so concerned about this, Mr. Randi?
Isn't it just a lot of fun?"
No, it is not fun. It is a cruel farce.
Now, it may bring a certain amount of comfort,
but that comfort lasts
only about 20 minutes or so.
And then the people look in the mirror, and they say,
I just paid a lot of money for that reading.
And what did she say to me? 'I love you!'"
They always say that.
They don't get any information,
they don't get any value for what they spend.
We call her "The Talons."
Sylvia Browne -- thank you --
Sylvia Browne is the big operator
in this field at this very moment.
Now, Sylvia Browne -- just to show you --
she actually gets 700 dollars
for a 20 minute reading over the telephone,
she doesn't even go there in person,
and you have to wait up to two years because
she's booked ahead that amount of time.
You pay by credit card or whatever,
and then she will call you
sometime in the next two years.
You can tell it's her. "Hello, this is Sylvia Browne."
That's her, you can tell right away.
Now, Montel Williams is an intelligent man.
We all know who he is on television.
He's well educated, he's smart,
he knows what Sylvia Browne is doing
but he doesn't give a damn.
He just doesn't care.
Because, the bottom line is, the sponsors love it,
and he will expose her
to television publicity all the time.
She gives you the names of your guardian angels, that's first.
Now, without that, how could we possibly function? (Laughter)
She gives you the names of previous lives,
who you were in previous lives.
Duh.
It turns out that the women
that she gives readings for
were all Babylonian princesses, or something like that.
And the men were all Grecian warriors
fighting with Agamemnon.
Nothing is ever said about
a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of London
who died of consumption.
He isn't worth bringing back, obviously.
And the strange thing -- folks, you may have noticed this too.
You see these folks on television --
they never call anybody back from hell. (Laughter)
Everyone comes back from heaven, but never from hell.
If they call back any of my friends,
they're not going to... Well, you see the story.
an exception in one way,
because the James Randi Educational Foundation, my foundation,
offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds.
Very simply won.
All you have to do is prove any paranormal, occult
or supernatural event or power of any kind
under proper observing conditions.
It's very easy, win the million dollars.
Sylvia Browne is an exception in that
she's the only professional psychic
in the whole world
that has accepted our challenge.
She did this on the "Larry King Live" show on CNN
six and a half years ago.
And we haven't heard from her since. Strange.
She said that, first of all, that she didn't know how to contact me.
Duh.
A professional psychic who speaks to dead people,
she can't reach me?
(Laughter)
I'm alive, you may have noticed.
Well, pretty well anyway.
She couldn't reach me. Now she says she doesn't want to reach me
because I'm a godless person.
All the more reason to take the million dollars,
wouldn't you think, Sylvia?
They need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce.
We get people coming to the foundation all the time.
They're ruined financially and emotionally
because they've given their money and their faith
to these people.
I have to explain that to you.
Homeopathy, let's find out what that's all about.
Hmm. You've heard of it.
It's an alternative form of healing, right?
Homeopathy actually consists -- and that's what this is.
This is Calms Forte,
32 caplets of sleeping pills! I forgot to tell you that.
I just ingested
six and a half days worth of sleeping pills.
(Laughter)
Six and a half days, that certainly is a fatal dose.
It says right on the back here,
"In case of overdose,
contact your poison control center immediately,"
and it gives an 800 number.
Keep your seats -- it's going to be okay.
I don't really need it
because I've been doing this stunt
for audiences all over the world
for the last eight or 10 years,
taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The answer may surprise you.
What is homeopathy?
It's taking a medicine that really works
and diluting it down
well beyond Avogadro's limit.
Diluting it down to the point
where there's none of it left. (Laughter)
Now folks, this is not
just a metaphor I'm going to give you now, it's true.
It's exactly equivalent to taking
one 325 milligram aspirin tablet,
throwing it into the middle of Lake Tahoe,
and then stirring it up, obviously with a very big stick,
and waiting two years or so
until the solution is homogeneous.
Then, when you get a headache,
you take a sip of this water, and -- voila! -- it is gone.
(Laughter)
Now that is true. That is what homeopathy is all about.
the more dilute the medicine is, they say,
the more powerful it is.
Now wait a minute, we heard about a guy in Florida.
The poor man, he was on homeopathic medicine.
He died of an overdose.
He forgot to take his pill.
(Laughter)
Work on it. Work on it.
It's a ridiculous thing. It is absolutely ridiculous.
I don't know what we're doing,
believing in all this nonsense over all these years.
The James Randi Educational Foundation
is waving this very big carrot,
but I must say, the fact that nobody
has taken us up on this offer
doesn't mean that the powers don't exist.
They might, some place out there.
Maybe these people are just independently wealthy.
Well, with Sylvia Browne I would think so.
You know, 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading
over the telephone --
that's more than lawyers make!
I mean that's a fabulous amount of money.
These people don't need the million dollars perhaps,
but wouldn't you think they'd like to take it
just to make me look silly?
Just to get rid of this godless person out there
that Sylvia Browne talks about all the time?
We really would love to have suggestions from you folks
on how to contact federal, state
and local authorities
to get them to do something.
If you find out -- now I understand.
We've seen people, even today, speaking to us
about AIDS epidemics
and starving kids around the world
and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with.
Those are very important,
critically important to us.
And we must do something about those problems.
But at the same time,
as Arthur C. Clarke said,
The rotting of the human mind,
the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult
and the supernatural --
all of this total nonsense,
this medieval thinking --
I think something should be done about that,
and it all lies in education.
Largely, it's the media
who are to blame for this sort of thing.
They shamelessly promote
all kinds of nonsense of this sort
because it pleases the sponsors.
It's the bottom line, the dollar line.
That's what they're looking at.
I'm willing to take your suggestions,
and I'm willing to have you
tune in to our webpage.
It's www.randi.org.
Go in there and look at the archives,
and you will begin to understand much more
of what I've been talking about today.
You will see the records that we have.
There's nothing like sitting in that library
and having a family appear there
and say that Mum gave away all the family fortune.
She cashed in the CDs,
she gave away the stocks and the certificates.
That's really sad to hear,
and it hasn't helped them one bit,
hasn't solved any of their problems.
Yes, there could be a rotting of the American mind,
and of the minds all the way around the earth,
if we don't start to think sensibly about these things.
as I say, we've dangled the carrot.
We're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it.
Oh, we get lots of them,
hundreds of them every year come by.
These are dowsers and people
who think that they can talk to the dead as well,
but they're amateurs; they don't know how to evaluate
their own so-called powers.
The professionals never come near us,
except in that case of Sylvia Browne
that I told you about a moment ago.
She did accept and then backed away.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm James Randi,
and I'm waiting.
I first became fascinated with octopus at an early age.
I grew up in Mobile, Alabama --
somebody's got to be from Mobile, right? --
and Mobile sits at the confluence of five rivers,
forming this beautiful delta.
And the delta has alligators crawling
in and out of rivers filled with fish
and cypress trees dripping with snakes,
birds of every flavor.
It's an absolute magical wonderland to live in --
if you're a kid interested in animals, to grow up in.
And this delta water flows to Mobile Bay, and finally into the Gulf of Mexico.
was probably at age five or six.
I was in the gulf, and I was swimming around and saw a little octopus on the bottom.
And I reached down and picked him up, and immediately
became fascinated and impressed by its speed and its strength and agility.
It was prying my fingers apart and moving to the back of my hand.
It was all I could do to hold onto this amazing creature.
Then it sort of calmed down in the palms of my hands
and started flashing colors,
just pulsing all of these colors.
And as I looked at it, it kind of tucked its arms under it,
raised into a spherical shape
and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes.
I'm going, "My gosh!" I had never seen anything like this in my life!
So I marveled for a moment, and then decided it was time to release him,
so I put him down.
The octopus left my hands and then did the damnedest thing:
It landed on the bottom in the rubble
and -- fwoosh! -- vanished
right before my eyes.
that is an animal that I want to learn more about. So I did.
And I went off to college and got a degree in marine zoology,
and then moved to Hawaii and entered graduate school
at the University of Hawaii.
And while a student at Hawaii, I worked at the Waikiki Aquarium.
And the aquarium had a lot of big fish tanks
but not a lot of invertebrate displays,
and being the spineless guy, I thought, well
I'll just go out in the field and collect these wonderful animals
I had been learning about as a student
and bring them in, and I built these elaborate sets and put them on display.
but they didn't really interact with people.
But the octopus did.
If you walked up to an octopus tank,
especially early in the morning before anyone arrived,
the octopus would rise up and look at you
and you're thinking, "Is that guy really looking at me? He is looking at me!"
And you walk up to the front of the tank. Then you realize
that these animals all have different personalities:
Some of them would hold their ground,
others would slink into the back of the tank and disappear in the rocks,
and one in particular, this amazing animal ...
I went up to the front of the tank, and he's just staring at me,
and he had little horns come up above his eyes.
So I went right up to the front of the tank --
I was three or four inches from the front glass --
and the octopus was sitting on a perch, a little rock,
and he came off the rock and he also came down right to the front of the glass.
So I was staring at this animal about six or seven inches away,
and at that time I could actually focus that close;
now as I look at my fuzzy fingers I realize those days are long gone.
Anyway, there we were, staring at each other,
and he reaches down and grabs an armful of gravel
and releases it in the jet of water entering the tank
from the filtration system,
and -- chk chk chk chk chk! -- this gravel hits the front of the glass and falls down.
He reaches up, takes another armful of gravel, releases it --
chk chk chk chk chk! -- same thing.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift an arm.
Then he lifts another arm and I lift another arm.
And then I realize the octopus won the arms race,
because I was out and he had six left. (Laughter)
But the only way I can describe what I was seeing that day
was that this octopus was playing,
which is a pretty sophisticated behavior for a mere invertebrate.
a funny thing happened on the way to the office,
which actually changed the course of my life.
A man came into the aquarium. It's a long story, but essentially
he sent me and a couple of friends of mine to the South Pacific
to collect animals for him,
and as we left, he gave us two 16-millimeter movie cameras.
He said, "Make a movie about this expedition."
"OK, a couple of biologists making a movie --
this'll be interesting,"
and off we went. And we did, we made a movie,
which had to be the worst movie ever made
in the history of movie making,
but it was a blast. I had so much fun.
And I remember that proverbial light going off in my head,
thinking, "Wait a minute.
Maybe I can do this all the time.
Yeah, I'll be a filmmaker."
So I literally came back from that job,
quit school, hung my filmmaking shingle
and just never told anyone that I didn't know what I was doing.
It's been a good ride.
And what I learned in school though was really beneficial.
If you're a wildlife filmmaker
and you're going out into the field to film animals,
especially behavior,
it helps to have a fundamental background
on who these animals are,
how they work and, you know, a bit about their behaviors.
was in the field, as a filmmaker
making films with them,
where you're allowed to spend large periods of time
with the animals, seeing octopus being octopus
in their ocean homes.
I remember I took a trip to Australia,
went to an island called One Tree Island.
And apparently, evolution had occurred
at a pretty rapid rate on One Tree,
between the time they named it and the time I arrived,
because I'm sure there were at least three trees
on that island when we were there.
Anyway, one tree is situated right next to
a beautiful coral reef.
In fact, there's a surge channel
where the tide is moving back and forth, twice a day, pretty rapidly.
And there's a beautiful reef,
very complex reef, with lots of animals,
including a lot of octopus.
And not uniquely
but certainly, the octopus in Australia
are masters at camouflage.
As a matter of fact,
there's one right there.
So our first challenge was to find these things,
and that was a challenge, indeed.
But the idea is, we were there for a month
and I wanted to acclimate the animals to us
so that we could see behaviors without disturbing them.
So the first week was pretty much spent
just getting as close as we could,
every day a little closer, a little closer, a little closer.
And you knew what the limit was: they would start getting twitchy
and you'd back up, come back in a few hours.
And after the first week, they ignored us.
It was like, "I don't know what that thing is, but he's no threat to me."
So they went on about their business
and from a foot away, we're watching mating
and courting and fighting
and it is just an unbelievable experience.
that I remember, or at least visually,
was a foraging behavior.
And they had a lot of different techniques
that they would use for foraging,
but this particular one used vision.
And they would see a coral head,
maybe 10 feet away,
and start moving over toward that coral head.
And I don't know whether they actually saw crab in it, or imagined that one might be,
but whatever the case, they would leap off the bottom
and go through the water and land right on top of this coral head,
and then the web between the arms
would completely engulf the coral head,
and they would fish out, swim for crabs.
And as soon as the crabs touched the arm, it was lights out.
And I always wondered what happened under that web.
So we created a way to find out, (Laughter)
and I got my first look at that famous beak in action.
It was fantastic.
you might as well pick one that's fairly common.
And octopus are, they live in all the oceans.
They also live deep.
And I can't say octopus are responsible
for my really strong interest
in getting in subs and going deep,
but whatever the case, I like that.
It's like nothing you've ever done.
and see something that you have never seen,
and have an excellent chance of seeing something
no one has ever seen, get in a sub.
You climb in, seal the hatch, turn on a little oxygen,
turn on the scrubber,
which removes the CO2 in the air you breathe, and they chuck you overboard.
Down you go. There's no connection to the surface
apart from a pretty funky radio.
And as you go down, the washing machine
at the surface calms down.
And it gets quiet.
And it starts getting really nice.
And as you go deeper, that lovely, blue water you were launched in
gives way to darker and darker blue.
And finally, it's a rich lavender,
and after a couple of thousand feet, it's ink black.
And now you've entered the realm
of the mid-water community.
about the creatures that live in the mid-water.
Suffice to say though, as far as I'm concerned,
without question, the most bizarre designs
and outrageous behaviors
are in the animals that live in the mid-water community.
But we're just going to zip right past this area,
this area that includes about 95 percent
of the living space on our planet
and go to the mid-ocean ridge, which I think is even more extraordinary.
40,000 miles long, snaking around the entire globe.
And they're big mountains, thousands of feet tall,
some of which are tens of thousands of feet
and bust through the surface,
creating islands like Hawaii.
And the top of this mountain range
is splitting apart, creating a rift valley.
And when you dive into that rift valley, that's where the action is
because literally thousands of active volcanoes
are going off at any point in time
all along this 40,000 mile range.
And as these tectonic plates are spreading apart,
magma, lava is coming up and filling those gaps,
and you're looking land -- new land --
being created right before your eyes.
And over the tops of them is 3,000 to 4,000 meters of water
creating enormous pressure,
forcing water down through the cracks toward the center of the earth,
until it hits a magma chamber
where it becomes superheated
and supersaturated with minerals,
reverses its flow and starts shooting back to the surface
and is ejected out of the earth like a geyser at Yellowstone.
In fact, this whole area
is like a Yellowstone National Park with all of the trimmings.
The surrounding water is just a couple of degrees above freezing.
So it immediately cools,
and it can no longer hold in suspension
all of the material that it's dissolved,
and it precipitates out, forming black smoke.
And it forms these towers, these chimneys
that are 10, 20, 30 feet tall.
And all along the sides of these chimneys
is shimmering with heat and loaded with life.
You've got black smokers going all over the place
and chimneys that have tube worms
that might be eight to 10 feet long.
And out of the tops of these tube worms
are these beautiful red plumes.
And living amongst the tangle of tube worms
is an entire community of animals:
shrimp, fish, lobsters, crab,
clams and swarms of arthropods
that are playing that dangerous game
between over here is scalding hot and freezing cold.
wasn't even known about
until 33 years ago.
And it completely threw science on its head.
It made scientists rethink
where life on Earth might have actually begun.
And before the discovery of these vents,
all life on Earth, the key to life on Earth,
was believed to be the sun and photosynthesis.
But down there, there is no sun,
there is no photosynthesis;
it's chemosynthetic environment down there driving it,
and it's all so ephemeral.
You might film this
unbelievable hydrothermal vent,
which you think at the time has to be on another planet.
It's amazing to think that this is actually on earth;
it looks like aliens in an alien environment.
But you go back to the same vent eight years later
and it can be completely dead.
There's no hot water.
All of the animals are gone, they're dead,
and the chimneys are still there
creating a really nice ghost town,
an eerie, spooky ghost town,
but essentially devoid of animals, of course.
But 10 miles down the ridge...
pshhh! There's another volcano going.
And there's a whole new hydrothermal vent community that has been formed.
And this kind of life and death of hydrothermal vent communities
is going on every 30 or 40 years
all along the ridge.
of the hydrothermal vent community
isn't really different from some of the
areas that I've seen
in 35 years of traveling around, making films.
Where you go and film a really nice sequence at a bay.
And you go back, and I'm at home,
and I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I shoot ...
Ah! I know where I can shoot that.
There's this beautiful bay, lots of soft corals and stomatopods."
And you show up, and it's dead.
There's no coral, algae growing on it, and the water's pea soup.
You think, "Well, what happened?"
And you turn around,
and there's a hillside behind you with a neighborhood going in,
and bulldozers are pushing piles of soil back and forth.
And over here
there's a golf course going in.
And this is the tropics.
It's raining like crazy here.
So this rainwater is flooding down the hillside,
carrying with it sediments from the construction site,
smothering the coral and killing it.
And fertilizers and pesticides
are flowing into the bay from the golf course --
the pesticides killing all the larvae and little animals,
fertilizer creating this beautiful plankton bloom --
and there's your pea soup.
I've been to a place that was a pretty trashed bay.
And I looked at it, just said, "Yuck,"
and go and work on the other side of the island.
Five years later, come back,
and that same bay is now gorgeous. It's beautiful.
It's got living coral, fish all over the place,
crystal clear water, and you go, "How did that happen?"
Well, how it happened is
the local community galvanized.
They recognized what was happening on the hillside and put a stop to it;
enacted laws and made permits required
to do responsible construction
and golf course maintenance
and stopped the sediments flowing into the bay,
and stopped the chemicals flowing into the bay,
and the bay recovered.
The ocean has an amazing ability
to recover, if we'll just leave it alone.
said it best.
She said that a small group of thoughtful people
could change the world.
Indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.
And a small group of thoughtful people
changed that bay.
I'm a big fan of grassroots organizations.
I've been to a lot of lectures
where, at the end of it, inevitably,
one of the first questions that comes up is,
"But, but what can I do?
I'm an individual. I'm one person.
And these problems are so large and global, and it's just overwhelming."
Fair enough question.
at the big, overwhelming issues of the world.
Look in your own backyard.
Look in your heart, actually.
What do you really care about that isn't right where you live?
And fix it.
Create a healing zone in your neighborhood
and encourage others to do the same.
And maybe these healing zones can sprinkle a map,
little dots on a map.
And in fact, the way that we can communicate today --
where Alaska is instantly knowing what's going on in China,
and the Kiwis did this, and then over in England they tried to ...
and everybody is talking to everyone else --
it's not isolated points on a map anymore,
it's a network we've created.
And maybe these healing zones can start growing,
and possibly even overlap, and good things can happen.
So that's how I answer that question.
Look in your own backyard, in fact, look in the mirror.
What can you do that is more responsible
than what you're doing now?
And do that, and spread the word.
The vent community animals
can't really do much
about the life and death
that's going on where they live, but up here we can.
In theory, we're thinking, rational human beings.
And we can make changes to our behavior
that will influence and affect the environment,
like those people changed the health of that bay.
was to beseech us to do anything we could,
everything we could,
to set aside not pin pricks,
but significant expanses
of the ocean for preservation,
"hope spots," she calls them.
And I applaud that. I loudly applaud that.
And it's my hope that some of these "hope spots"
can be in the deep ocean,
an area that has historically
been seriously neglected, if not abused.
The term "deep six" comes to mind:
"If it's too big or too toxic for a landfill,
deep six it!"
So, I hope that we can also keep
some of these "hope spots" in the deep sea.
Now, I don't get a wish,
but I certainly can say
that I will do anything I can
to support Sylvia Earle's wish.
And that I do.
The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,
wrote a volume called
"People Who Led to My Plays."
And if I were to write a volume,
it would be called,
"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"
because my work,
in understanding art and in understanding culture,
has come by following artists,
by looking at what artists mean
and what they do and who they are.
J.J. from "Good Times,"
(Applause)
significant to many people of course
because of "Dy-no-mite,"
but perhaps more significant
as the first, really, black artist
on primetime TV.
Jean-Michel Basquiat,
important to me because [he was]
the first black artist in real time
that showed me the possibility of
who and what I was about to enter into.
specifically, about black artists --
very generally
about the way in which art
can change the way we think
about culture and ourselves.
My interest is in artists
who understand and rewrite history,
who think about themselves
within the narrative
of the larger world of art,
but who have created new places
for us to see and understand.
I'm showing two artists here, Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,
two of many who really form for me
the essential questions that I wanted to bring
as a curator to the world.
I was interested in the idea
of why and how
I could create a new story,
a new narrative in art history
and a new narrative in the world.
And to do this, I knew
that I had to see the way in which artists work,
understand the artist's studio
as a laboratory,
imagine, then,
reinventing the museum as a think tank
and looking at the exhibition
as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,
providing the space
to look and to think about answers.
when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,
I made an exhibition called Black Male.
It looked at the intersection
of race and gender
in contemporary American art.
It sought to express
the ways in which art
could provide a space for dialogue --
complicated dialogue,
dialogue with many, many points of entry --
and how the museum could be the space
for this contest of ideas.
This exhibition included
over 20 artists
of various ages and races,
but all looking at black masculinity
from a very particular point of view.
What was significant about this exhibition
is the way in which
it engaged me in my role
as a curator, as a catalyst,
for this dialogue.
One of the things that happened
very distinctly in the course of this exhibition
is I was confronted with the idea
of how powerful images can be
in people's understanding of themselves and each other.
one on the left by Robert Colescott.
And in the course of the exhibition --
which was contentious, controversial
and ultimately, for me,
life-changing
in my sense of what art could be --
a woman came up to me on the gallery floor
to express her concern about the nature
of how powerful images could be
and how we understood each other.
And she pointed to the work on the left
to tell me how problematic this image was,
as it related, for her, to the idea of
how black people had been represented.
And she pointed to the image on the right
as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity
that needed to be portrayed
to work against those images in the media.
She then assigned these works racial identities,
basically saying to me that the work on the right,
clearly, was made by a black artist,
the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,
when, in effect,
that was the opposite case:
Bob Colescott, African-American artist;
Leon Golub, a white artist.
The point of that for me was
to say -- in that space, in that moment --
that I really, more than anything,
wanted to understand
how images could work, how images did work,
and how artists provided
a space bigger than one
that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives
to work through these images.
home for many of black America,
very much the psychic heart
of the black experience,
really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.
Harlem now, sort of explaining
and thinking of itself in this part of the century,
looking both backwards and forwards ...
I always say Harlem is an interesting community
because, unlike many other places,
it thinks of itself in the past, present
and the future simultaneously;
no one speaks of it just in the now.
It's always what it was and what it can be.
And, in thinking about that,
then my second project, the second question I ask is:
Can a museum
be a catalyst in a community?
Can a museum house artists
and allow them to be change agents
as communities rethink themselves?
This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,
thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.
thinking about exhibitions there,
thinking about what it means to
discover art's possibility.
Now, what does this mean to some of you?
In some cases, I know that many of you
are involved in cross-cultural dialogues,
you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.
Think about the place that artists can play in that --
that is the kind of incubation and advocacy
that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.
Think about artists, not as content providers,
though they can be brilliant at that,
but, again, as real catalysts.
And I bring this up because it's important to locate
this practice in history.
To look at 1968,
in the incredible historic moment that it is,
and think of the arc that has happened since then,
to think of the possibilities that we are all
privileged to stand in today
and imagine that this museum
that came out of a moment of great protest
and one that was so much about
examining the history and the legacy
of important African-American artists
to the history of art in this country
like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,
Romare Bearden.
to bring us to today.
In 1975, Muhammad Ali
gave a lecture at Harvard University.
After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,
"Give us a poem."
And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."
A profound statement about the individual and the community.
The space in which now,
in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,
of trying to define
what might be
black art cultural movement of the 21st century.
What that might mean
for cultural movements all over this moment,
the "me, we" seems
incredibly prescient
totally important.
the specific project that has made this possible for me
is a series of exhibitions,
all titled with an F --
Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --
which have set out to discover
and define
the young, black artists working in this moment
who I feel strongly
will continue to work over the next many years.
This series of exhibitions
was made specifically
to try and question
the idea of what it would mean
now, at this point in history,
to see art as a catalyst;
what it means now, at this point in history,
as we define and redefine culture,
black culture specifically in my case,
but culture generally.
I named this group of artists
around an idea, which I put out there
called post-black,
really meant to define them
as artists who came and start their work now,
looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.
that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.
This new set of questions is:
What does it mean, right now,
to be African-American in America?
What can artwork say about this?
Where can a museum exist
as the place for us all
to have this conversation?
Really, most exciting about this
is thinking about the energy and the excitement
that young artists can bring.
Their works for me are about,
not always just simply
about the aesthetic innovation
that their minds imagine, that their visions create
and put out there in the world,
but more, perhaps, importantly,
through the excitement of the community
that they create as important voices
that would allow us right now to understand our situation,
as well as in the future.
I am continually amazed
by the way in which
the subject of race
can take itself in many places
that we don't imagine it should be.
I am always amazed
by the way in which artists are willing
to do that in their work.
It is why I look to art.
It's why I ask questions of art.
It is why I make exhibitions.
40 young artists done over the course of eight years,
and for me it's about considering the implications.
It's considering the implications of
what this generation has to say to the rest of us.
It's considering what it means for these artists
to be both out in the world as their work travels,
but in their communities
as people who are seeing and thinking
about the issues that face us.
It's also about thinking about
the creative spirit and nurturing it,
and imagining, particularly in urban America,
about the nurturing of the spirit.
For me, it is about re-imagining
this cultural discourse in an international context.
So the last iteration of this project
has been called Flow,
with the idea now of creating
a real network
of artists around the world;
really looking, not so much
from Harlem and out, but looking across,
and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.
And as many of us think about that continent
and think about what if means
to us all in the 21st century,
I have begun that looking
through artists, through artworks,
and imagining what they can tell us about the future,
what they tell us about our future,
and what they create in their sense of
offering us this great possibility of watching
that continent emerge as part
of our bigger dialogue.
So, what do I discover
What do I think about
when I think about art?
I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator
is not just the discovery of new works,
the discovery of exciting works.
But, really, it has been
what I've discovered about myself
and what I can offer
in the space of an exhibition,
to talk about beauty, to talk about power,
to talk about ourselves,
and to talk and speak to each other.
That's what makes me get up every day
and want to think about
this generation of black artists and artists around the world.
Several years ago here at TED, Peter Skillman
introduced a design challenge
called the marshmallow challenge.
And the idea's pretty simple:
Teams of four have to build the tallest free-standing structure
out of 20 sticks of spaghetti,
one yard of tape, one yard of string
and a marshmallow.
The marshmallow has to be on top.
And, though it seems really simple, it's actually pretty hard
because it forces people
to collaborate very quickly.
And so, I thought this was an interesting idea,
and I incorporated it into a design workshop.
And it was a huge success.
And since then, I've conducted
about 70 design workshops across the world
with students and designers and architects,
even the CTOs of the Fortune 50,
and there's something about this exercise
that reveals very deep lessons
about the nature of collaboration,
and I'd like to share some of them with you.
by orienting themselves to the task.
They talk about it, they figure out what it's going to look like,
they jockey for power.
Then they spend some time planning, organizing,
they sketch and they lay out spaghetti.
They spend the majority of their time
assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures.
And then finally, just as they're running out of time,
someone takes out the marshmallow,
and then they gingerly put it on top,
and then they stand back, and -- ta-da! --
they admire their work.
But what really happens, most of the time,
is that the "ta-da" turns into an "uh-oh,"
because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure
to buckle and to collapse.
who have a lot more "uh-oh" moments than others,
and among the worst are recent graduates of business school.
(Laughter)
They lie, they cheat, they get distracted
and they produce really lame structures.
And of course there are teams
that have a lot more "ta-da" structures,
and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten.
(Laughter)
And it's pretty amazing.
As Peter tells us,
not only do they produce the tallest structures,
but they're the most interesting structures of them all.
How come? Why? What is it about them?
And Peter likes to say that
none of the kids spend any time
trying to be CEO of Spaghetti, Inc. Right?
They don't spend time jockeying for power.
But there's another reason as well.
And the reason is that business students are trained
to find the single right plan, right?
And then they execute on it.
And then what happens is, when they put the marshmallow on the top,
they run out of time and what happens?
It's a crisis.
Sound familiar? Right.
What kindergarteners do differently
is that they start with the marshmallow,
and they build prototypes, successive prototypes,
always keeping the marshmallow on top,
so they have multiple times to fix when they build prototypes along the way.
Designers recognize this type of collaboration
as the essence of the iterative process.
And with each version, kids get instant feedback
about what works and what doesn't work.
but let's look at how different teams perform.
So the average for most people is around 20 inches;
business schools students, about half of that;
lawyers, a little better, but not much better than that,
kindergarteners, better than most adults.
Who does the very best?
Architects and engineers, thankfully.
(Laughter)
Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I've seen.
And why is it? Because they understand triangles
and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns
are the key to building
stable structures.
So CEOs, a little bit better than average,
but here's where it gets interesting.
If you put you put an executive admin. on the team,
they get significantly better.
(Laughter)
It's incredible. You know, you look around, you go, "Oh, that team's going to win."
You can just tell beforehand. And why is that?
Because they have special skills
of facilitation.
They manage the process, they understand the process.
And any team who manages
and pays close attention to work
will significantly improve the team's performance.
Specialized skills and facilitation skills
are the combination that leads to strong success.
If you have 10 teams that typically perform,
you'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures.
I thought, let's up the ante, once.
So I offered a 10,000 dollar prize of software to the winning team.
So what do you think happened to these design students?
What was the result?
Here's what happened:
Not one team had a standing structure.
If anyone had built, say, a one inch structure,
they would have taken home the prize.
So, isn't that interesting? That high stakes
have a strong impact.
We did the exercise again with the same students.
What do you think happened then?
So now they understand the value of prototyping.
So the same team went from being the very worst
to being among the very best.
They produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time.
So there's deep lessons for us
about the nature of incentives and success.
actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge?
And the reason is, I help create
digital tools and processes
to help teams build cars and video games
and visual effects.
And what the marshmallow challenge does
is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions.
Because, frankly,
every project has its own marshmallow, doesn't it?
The challenge provides a shared experience,
a common language,
a common stance to build the right prototype.
And so, this is the value of the experience,
of this so simple exercise.
may want to go to MarshmallowChallenge.com.
It's a blog that you can look at
how to build the marshmallows.
There's step-by-step instructions on this.
There are crazy examples from around the world
of how people tweak and adjust the system.
There's world records that are on this as well.
is that design truly is
a contact sport.
It demands that we bring all of our senses to the task,
and that we apply the very best of our thinking,
our feeling and our doing
to the challenge that we have at hand.
And sometimes, a little prototype of this experience
is all that it takes to turn us
from an "uh-oh" moment to a "ta-da" moment.
And that can make a big difference.
First of all, I'm a geek.
I'm an organic food-eating,
carbon footprint-minimizing, robotic surgery geek.
And I really want to build green,
but I'm very suspicious
of all of these well-meaning articles,
people long on moral authority
and short on data,
telling me how to do these kinds of things.
And so I have to figure this out for myself.
For example: Is this evil?
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt
from happy self-actualized local cows
on my counter top,
and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up.
But can I use a paper towel? (Laughter)
This is the amount of energy that goes into
any paper towel or embodied water,
and every time I use a paper towel,
I am using this much
virtual energy and water.
Wipe it up, throw it away.
Now, if I compare that to a cotton towel
that I can use a thousand times,
I don't have a whole lot of embodied energy
until I wash that yogurty towel.
This is now operating energy.
So if I throw my towel in the washing machine,
I've now put energy and water
back into that towel ...
unless I use a front-loading, high-efficiency washing machine, (Laughter)
and then it looks a little bit better.
But what about a recycled paper towel
that comes in those little half sheets?
Well, now a paper towel looks better.
Screw the paper towels. Let's go to a sponge.
I wipe it up with a sponge, and I put it under the running water,
and I have a lot less energy and a lot more water.
Unless you're like me and you leave the handle
in the position of hot even when you turn it on,
and then you start to use more energy.
Or worse, you let it run until it's warm
to rinse out your towel.
And now all bets are off.
sometimes the things that you least expect --
the position in which you put the handle --
have a bigger effect than any of those other things
that you were trying to optimize.
Now imagine someone as twisted as me
trying to build a house.
(Laughter)
That's what my husband and I are doing right now.
And so, we wanted to know, how green could we be?
And there's a thousand and one articles out there
telling us how to make all these green trade-offs.
And they are just as suspect
in telling us to optimize these little things around the edges
and missing the elephant in the living room.
Now, the average house
has about 300 megawatt hours
of embodied energy in it;
this is the energy it takes to make it --
millions and millions of paper towels.
And so, like many people,
we start with a house on a lot,
and I'm going to show you a typical construction on the top
and what we're doing on the bottom.
So first, we demolish it.
It takes some energy, but if you deconstruct it --
you take it all apart, you use the bits --
you can get some of that energy back.
We then dug a big hole
to put in a rainwater catchment tank
to take our yard water independent.
And then we poured a big foundation
for passive solar.
Now, you can reduce the embodied energy
by about 25 percent
by using high fly ash concrete.
We then put in framing.
And so this is framing -- lumber,
composite materials --
and it's kind of hard to get the embodied energy out of that,
but it can be a sustainable resource
if you use FSC-certified lumber.
the first thing that was very surprising.
If we put aluminum windows in this house,
we would double the energy use right there.
Now, PVC is a little bit better,
but still not as good as the wood that we chose.
We then put in plumbing,
electrical and HVAC,
and insulate.
Now, spray foam is an excellent insulator -- it fills in all the cracks --
but it is pretty high embodied energy,
and, sprayed-in cellulose or blue jeans
is a much lower energy alternative to that.
We also used straw bale
infill for our library,
which has zero embodied energy.
When it comes time to sheetrock,
if you use EcoRock it's about a quarter
of the embodied energy of standard sheetrock.
the subject of all of those "go green" articles,
and on the scale of a house
they almost make no difference at all.
And yet, all the press is focused on that.
Except for flooring.
If you put carpeting in your house,
it's about a tenth of the embodied energy of the entire house,
unless you use concrete or wood
for a much lower embodied energy.
So now we add in the final construction energy, we add it all up,
and we've built a house for less than half
of the typical embodied energy for building a house like this.
too much on the back,
we have poured 151 megawatt hours
of energy into constructing this house
when there was a house there before.
And so the question is:
How could we make that back?
And so if I run my new energy-efficient house forward,
compared with the old, non-energy-efficient house,
we make it back in about six years.
Now, I probably would have upgraded the old house
to be more energy-efficient,
and in that case,
it would take me more about 20 years to break even.
Now, if I hadn't paid attention to embodied energy,
it would have taken us
over 50 years to break even
compared to the upgraded house.
So what does this mean?
On the scale of my portion of the house,
this is equivalent to about
as much as I drive in a year,
it's about five times as much
as if I went entirely vegetarian.
But my elephant in the living room flies.
Clearly, I need to walk home from TED.
But all the calculations
for embodied energy are on the blog.
to be the biggest changes that are.
In my industry,
we believe that images can change the world.
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.
The truth is that we know that the
images themselves don't change the world,
but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,
images have provoked reactions in people,
and those reactions have caused change to happen.
I'd be extremely surprised
if you didn't recognize many or most of them.
They're best described as iconic:
so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.
In fact, they're so well-known
that you might even recognize them
in a slightly or somewhat different form.
We're looking for something more.
We're looking for images that shine
an uncompromising light on crucial issues,
images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,
images that provoke us
to step up and do something --
in other words, to act.
Well, this image you've all seen.
It changed our view of the physical world.
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.
Many people credit
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement
to our seeing the planet like this
for the first time --
its smallness, its fragility.
are well aware of the destructive power
that our species can wield over our environment.
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.
This destructive power takes many different forms.
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton
in the Congo.
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,
and unsurprisingly,
they sparked international outrage.
Most recently,
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.
is man's destructive power over man.
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,
and I'll quote him,
"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,
even in its cruelest moments,
is benign in comparison with man,
when he loses his moral compass and his reason."
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib
as well as the images from Guantanamo
had a profound impact.
The publication of those images,
as opposed to the images themselves,
caused a government to change its policies.
Some would argue that it is those images
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq
than virtually any other single act.
Furthermore, those images forever removed
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.
In the 1960s and 1970s,
the Vietnam War was basically shown
in America's living rooms day in, day out.
News photos brought people face to face
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,
a student killed by the National Guard
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.
In fact, these images became
the voices of protest themselves.
to shed light of understanding
on suspicion, ignorance,
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this
but I'll just show one image --
the issue of HIV/AIDS.
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease
was an enormous barrier
to even discussing or addressing it.
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,
the Princess of Wales, touching
an HIV/AIDS infected baby
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.
we all have a choice:
We can look away, or we can address the image.
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in
The Guardian in 1998,
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.
Did the images change the world?
No, but they had a major impact.
Images often push us to question our core beliefs
and our responsibilities to each other.
We all saw those images after Katrina,
and I think for millions of people
they had a very strong impact.
And I think it's very unlikely
that they were far from the minds of Americans
when they went to vote in November 2008.
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.
I'll show you one photo here,
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran
from an extraordinary piece of work,
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.
But images don't need to be graphic
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.
After all the tense moments of conflict
in all the conflict zones of the world,
there's one photograph from a much quieter place
that haunts me still, much more than the others.
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,
it's you.
We bring to each image
our own values, our own belief systems,
and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.
My company has 70 million images.
I have one image in my office.
Here it is.
I hope that the next time you see
an image that sparks something in you,
you'll better understand why,
and I know that speaking to this audience,
you'll definitely do something about it.
Let's pretend right here we have a machine.
A big machine, a cool, TED-ish machine,
and it's a time machine.
And everyone in this room has to get into it.
And you can go backwards, you can go forwards;
you cannot stay where you are.
And I wonder what you'd choose, because I've been asking my friends
this question a lot lately and they all want to go back.
I don't know. They want to go back before there were automobiles
or Twitter or "American Idol."
I don't know.
I'm convinced that there's some sort of pull
to nostalgia, to wishful thinking.
And I understand that.
I don't want to go back, and it's not because I'm adventurous.
It's because possibilities on this planet,
they don't go back, they go forward.
So I want to get in the machine, and I want to go forward.
This is the greatest time there's ever been on this planet
by any measure that you wish to choose:
health, wealth,
mobility, opportunity,
declining rates of disease ...
There's never been a time like this.
My great-grandparents died, all of them,
by the time they were 60.
My grandparents pushed that number to 70.
My parents are closing in on 80.
So there better be
a nine at the beginning of my death number.
But it's not even about people like us,
can expect to live as long as
the richest man in the world did 100 years ago.
Think about that, it's an incredible fact.
And why is it true?
Smallpox. Smallpox killed billions
of people on this planet.
It reshaped the demography of the globe
in a way that no war ever has.
It's gone. It's vanished.
We vanquished it. Puff.
no longer exist, hardly.
Diphtheria, rubella, polio ...
does anyone even know what those things are?
Vaccines, modern medicine,
our ability to feed billions of people,
those are triumphs of the scientific method.
And to my mind, the scientific method --
trying stuff out,
seeing if it works, changing it when it doesn't --
is one of the great accomplishments of humanity.
Unfortunately, that's all the good news
because there are some other problems, and they've been mentioned many times.
And one of them is that
despite all our accomplishments,
a billion people go to bed hungry
in this world every day.
That number's rising, and it's rising really rapidly, and it's disgraceful.
And not only that, we've used our imagination
to thoroughly trash this globe.
Potable water, arable land,
rainforests, oil, gas:
they're going away, and they're going away soon,
and unless we innovate our way out of this mess,
we're going away too.
I think it's clear that we can make food
that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on.
I think we can power this world with energy
that doesn't also destroy it.
I really do believe that, and, no, it ain't wishful thinking.
But here's the thing that keeps me up at night --
one of the things that keeps me up at night:
We've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now. Never.
And we've also never been in a position
to deploy it properly in the way that we can today.
We're on the verge of amazing, amazing events
in many fields,
and yet I actually think we'd have to go back
hundreds, 300 years, before the Enlightenment,
to find a time when we battled progress,
when we fought about these things
more vigorously, on more fronts, than we do now.
and they do it so tightly that you can't set them free.
Not even the truth will set them free.
And, listen, everyone's entitled to their opinion;
they're even entitled to their opinion about progress.
But you know what you're not entitled to?
You're not entitled to your own facts. Sorry, you're not.
And this took me awhile to figure out.
for The New Yorker. A little story.
And I was amazed to find opposition:
opposition to what is, after all,
the most effective public health measure in human history.
I didn't know what to do,
so I just did what I do: I wrote a story and I moved on.
And soon after that,
I wrote a story about genetically engineered food.
Same thing, only bigger.
People were going crazy.
So I wrote a story about that too,
and I couldn't understand why
people thought this was "Frankenfoods,"
why they thought moving molecules around
in a specific, rather than a haphazard way,
was trespassing on nature's ground.
But, you know, I do what I do. I wrote the story, I moved on.
I mean, I'm a journalist.
We type, we file, we go to dinner. It's fine.
and I couldn't figure out why, and eventually I did.
And that's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy
weren't actually fanatics at all.
They were thoughtful people, educated people, decent people.
They were exactly like the people in this room.
And it just disturbed me so much.
But then I thought, you know, let's be honest.
We're at a point in this world
where we don't have the same relationship to progress that we used to.
We talk about it ambivalently.
We talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it:
"progress."
Okay, there are reasons for that, and I think we know what those reasons are.
We've lost faith in institutions,
in authority,
and sometimes in science itself,
and there's no reason we shouldn't have.
You can just say a few names
and people will understand.
Chernobyl, Bhopal, the Challenger,
Vioxx, weapons of mass destruction,
hanging chads.
You know, you can choose your list.
There are questions and problems
with the people we used to believe were always right,
so be skeptical.
Ask questions, demand proof, demand evidence.
Don't take anything for granted.
But here's the thing: When you get proof,
you need to accept the proof, and we're not that good at doing that.
And the reason that I can say that is because
we're now in an epidemic of fear
like one I've never seen and hope never to see again.
a horrible story,
that linked the epidemic of autism
to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine shot.
Very scary.
Tons of studies were done to see if this was true.
Tons of studies should have been done; it's a serious issue.
The data came back.
The data came back from the United States, from England,
from Sweden, from Canada,
and it was all the same: no correlation,
no connection, none at all.
It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter
because we believe anecdotes,
we believe what we see, what we think we see,
what makes us feel real.
We don't believe a bunch of documents
from a government official giving us data,
and I do understand that, I think we all do.
But you know what?
The result of that has been disastrous.
Disastrous because here's a fact:
The United States is one of the only countries in the world
where the vaccine rate for measles is going down.
That is disgraceful,
and we should be ashamed of ourselves.
It's horrible.
What kind of a thing happened
that we could do that?
Because, did anyone have measles here?
Has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles?
Doesn't happen very much.
Doesn't happen in this country at all,
but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year.
That's a lot of death of measles --
20 an hour.
But since it didn't happen here, we can put it out of our minds,
and people like Jenny McCarthy
can go around preaching messages
of fear and illiteracy from platforms
like "Oprah" and "Larry King Live."
And they can do it because
they don't link causation and correlation.
They don't understand that these things seem the same,
but they're almost never the same.
And it's something we need to learn, and we need to learn it really soon.
He took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us.
No fear, no agony. Polio -- puff, gone.
That guy in the middle, not so much.
His name is Paul Offit.
He just developed a rotavirus vaccine with a bunch of other people.
It'll save the lives of 400 to 500,000 kids
in the developing world every year.
Pretty good, right?
Well, it's good, except that Paul goes around talking about vaccines
and says how valuable they are
and that people ought to just stop the whining.
And he actually says it that way.
So, Paul's a terrorist.
When Paul speaks in a public hearing,
he can't testify without armed guards.
He gets called at home
because people like to tell him
that they remember where his kids go to school.
And why? Because Paul made a vaccine.
You take them away, disease comes back,
horrible diseases. And that's happening.
We have measles in this country now.
And it's getting worse, and pretty soon kids
are going to die of it again because it's just a numbers game.
And they're not just going to die of measles.
What about polio? Let's have that. Why not?
A college classmate of mine wrote me a couple weeks ago and said
she thought I was a little strident.
No one's ever said that before.
She wasn't going to vaccinate her kid against polio,
no way.
Fine.
Why? Because we don't have polio. And you know what?
We didn't have polio in this country yesterday.
Today, I don't know, maybe a guy got on a plane in Lagos this morning,
and he's flying to LAX, right now he's over Ohio.
And he's going to land in a couple of hours, he's going to rent a car,
and he's going to come to Long Beach,
and he's going to attend one of these fabulous TED dinners tonight.
And he doesn't know that he's infected with a paralytic disease,
and we don't either because that's the way the world works.
That's the planet we live on. Don't pretend it isn't.
Everyone take their vitamins this morning?
Echinacea, a little antioxidant
to get you going.
I know you did because half of Americans do every day.
They take the stuff, and they take alternative medicines,
and it doesn't matter how often
we find out that they're useless.
The data says it all the time.
They darken your urine. They almost never do more than that.
(Laughter)
It's okay, you want to pay 28 billion dollars for dark urine?
I'm totally with you.
(Laughter)
Dark urine. Dark.
Why do we do that? Why do we do that?
Well, I think I understand, we hate Big Pharma.
We hate Big Government. We don't trust the Man.
And we shouldn't: Our health care system sucks.
It's cruel to millions of people.
It's absolutely astonishingly cold
and soul-bending to those of us who can even afford it.
So we run away from it, and where do we run?
We leap into the arms of Big Placebo.
(Laughter)
That's fantastic. I love Big Placebo.
(Applause)
because this stuff is crap,
and we spend billions of dollars on it.
And I have all sorts of little props here.
None of it ... ginkgo, fraud;
echinacea, fraud;
acai -- I don't even know what that is
but we're spending billions of dollars on it -- it's fraud.
And you know what? When I say this stuff, people scream at me,
and they say, "What do you care? Let people do what they want to do.
It makes them feel good."
And you know what? You're wrong.
Because I don't care
if it's the secretary of HHS
who's saying, "Hmm, I'm not going to take the evidence
of my experts on mammograms,"
or some cancer quack who wants to treat his patient
with coffee enemas.
When you start down the road
where belief and magic replace evidence and science,
you end up in a place you don't want to be.
You end up in Thabo Mbeki South Africa.
He killed 400,000 of his people
by insisting that beetroot,
garlic and lemon oil
were much more effective than the antiretroviral drugs
we know can slow the course of AIDS.
Hundreds of thousands of needless deaths
in a country that has been plagued
worse than any other by this disease.
Please, don't tell me
there are no consequences to these things.
There are. There always are.
we're in the middle of right now
is this absurd battle
between proponents of genetically engineered food
and the organic elite.
It's an idiotic debate. It has to stop.
It's a debate about words, about metaphors.
It's ideology, it's not science.
Every single thing we eat, every grain of rice,
every sprig of parsley,
every Brussels sprout
has been modified by man.
You know, there weren't tangerines in the garden of Eden.
There wasn't any cantaloupe. (Laughter)
There weren't Christmas trees. We made it all.
We made it over the last 11,000 years.
And some of it worked, and some of it didn't.
We got rid of the stuff that didn't.
Now we can do it in a more precise way --
and there are risks, absolutely --
but we can put something like vitamin A into rice,
and that stuff can help millions of people,
millions of people, prolong their lives.
You don't want to do that?
I have to say, I don't understand it.
Why do we do that?
Well, the things I constantly hear are:
Too many chemicals,
pesticides, hormones,
monoculture, we don't want giant fields
of the same thing, that's wrong.
We don't companies patenting life.
We don't want companies owning seeds.
And you know what my response to all of that is?
Yes, you're right. Let's fix it.
It's true, we've got a huge food problem,
but this isn't science.
This has nothing to do with science.
It's law, it's morality, it's patent stuff.
You know science isn't a company.
It's not a country.
It's not even an idea; it's a process.
It's a process, and sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't,
but the idea that we should not allow
science to do its job
because we're afraid,
is really very deadening,
and it's preventing millions of people
from prospering.
we're going to have to grow 70 percent more food than we do right now,
70 percent.
This investment in Africa over the last 30 years.
Disgraceful. Disgraceful.
They need it, and we're not giving it to them.
And why? Genetically engineered food.
We don't want to encourage people
to eat that rotten stuff, like cassava for instance.
Cassava's something that half a billion people eat.
It's kind of like a potato.
It's just a bunch of calories. It sucks.
It doesn't have nutrients, it doesn't have protein,
and scientists are engineering
all of that into it right now.
And then people would be able to eat it and they'd be able to not go blind.
They wouldn't starve, and you know what?
That would be nice. It wouldn't be Chez Panisse,
but it would be nice.
Why are we fighting it?
I mean, let's ask ourselves: Why are we fighting it?
Because we don't want to move genes around?
This is about moving genes around. It's not about chemicals.
It's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones,
our insistence on having bigger food,
better food, singular food.
This isn't about Rice Krispies,
this is about keeping people alive,
and it's about time we started to understand what that meant.
Because, you know something?
If we don't, if we continue to act the way we're acting,
we're guilty of something that I don't think we want to be guilty of:
high-tech colonialism.
There's no other way to describe what's going on here.
It's selfish, it's ugly,
it's beneath us,
and we really have to stop it.
(Laughter)
you might want to say, "So, you still want to get in this
ridiculous time machine and go forward?"
Absolutely. Absolutely, I do.
It's stuck in the present right now,
but we have an amazing opportunity.
We can set that time machine on anything we want.
We can move it where we want to move it,
and we're going to move it where we want to move it.
We have to have these conversations and we have to think,
but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead,
we're going to be happy we do.
I know that we can,
and as far as I'm concerned,
that's something the world needs right now.
(Music)
I've been working on a project for the last six years
adapting children's poetry to music.
And that's a poem by Charles Edward Carryl,
who was a stockbroker in New York City
for 45 years,
but in the evenings, he wrote nonsense for his children.
And this book was one of the most famous books in America
for about 35 years.
"The Sleepy Giant," which is the song that I just sang,
is one of his poems.
Now, we're going to do
other poems for you,
and here's a preview of some of the poets.
This is Rachel Field,
Robert Graves --
a very young Robert Graves --
Christina Rossetti.
Ghosts, right?
Have nothing to say to us,
obsolete,
gone --
not so.
What I really enjoyed about this project
is reviving these people's words.
Taking them off the dead, flat pages.
Bringing them to life,
bringing them to light.
So, what we're going to do next
is a poem that was written by Nathalia Crane.
Nathalia Crane was a little girl from Brooklyn.
When she was 10 years old in 1927,
she published her first book of poems
called "The Janitor's Boy."
Here she is.
And here's her poem.
"Maggie and Milly and Molly and May."
It was written by Laurence Alma-Tadema.
She was the daughter of a very, very famous Dutch painter
who had made his fame in England.
He went there after the death
of his wife of smallpox
and brought his two young children.
One was his daughter, Laurence.
She wrote this poem when she was
18 years old in 1888,
and I look at it as kind of a
very sweet feminist manifesto
tinged with a little bit of defiance
and a little bit of resignation and regret.
Thank you.
after spending six years with them,
and started to research their lives,
and then decided to write a book about it.
And the burning question about Alma-Tadema
was: Did she marry?
And the answer was no,
which I found in the London Times archive.
She died alone in 1940
in the company of her books and her dear friends.
Gerard Manley Hopkins,
a saintly man.
He became a Jesuit.
He converted from his Anglican faith.
He was moved to by the Tractarian Movement,
the Oxford Movement, otherwise known as --
and he became a Jesuit priest.
He burned all his poetry at the age of 24
and then did not write another poem for at least seven years
because he couldn't rectify the life of a poet
with the life of a priest.
He died typhoid fever
at the age of 44, I believe,
43 or 44.
At the time, he was teaching classics
at Trinity College in Dublin.
A few years before he died,
after he had resumed writing poetry,
but in secret,
he confessed to a friend in a letter
that I found when I was doing my research:
"I've written a verse.
It is to explain death to a child,
and it deserves a piece of plain-song music."
And my blood froze when I read that
because I had written the plain-song music
130 years after he'd written the letter.
And the poem is called, "Spring and Fall."
all the scientists, the philosophers,
the architects, the inventors,
the biologists,
the botanists, the artists ...
everyone that blew my mind this week.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Just bring it down a little. (Laughter)
It's my turn.
I still have two minutes.
(Laughter)
Okay, we're going to start that verse again.
Calming the audience down;
I'm supposed to be whipping you into a frenzy, and I,
I have so much admiration for him.
I'll show you how to clap to this song. (Laughter) (Clapping)
Decrescendo.
Gradually, bringing it down,
bringing it down.
ain't no stopping.
Thank you so much.
So that's how it walks.
But when you look at us human beings, bipedal walking,
what you're doing is,
We call that the concept of passive dynamic locomotion.
What you're doing is, when you stand up,
potential energy to kinetic energy,
potential energy to kinetic energy.
It's a constantly falling process.
So even though there is nothing in nature that looks like this,
And it deploys legs -- it looks almost like "Star Wars" --
so when it lands, it absorbs the shock and starts walking.
What you see over here, this yellow thing, this is not a death ray.
The first version, in the back, that's STriDER I.
so we could get rid of all the motors, and with a single motor,
we can coordinate all the motions.
It's a mechanical solution to a problem, instead of using mechatronics.
but the spokes individually move in and out of the hub;
so, it's a wheel-leg hybrid.
We're literally reinventing the wheel here.
Just simply using the tactile sensors on the feet,
then it switches to a deliberate mode,
they use a method called differential steering
where the left and right wheel turn the opposite direction.
For IMPASS, we can do many, many different types of motion.
then can turn to the left and to the right.
These are just some examples of the neat things we can do with IMPASS.
But the current rovers cannot get there.
So, inspired by that, we wanted to build a robot
in real time, it calculates the force distribution:
how much force it needs to exert to the surface
so it doesn't tip and doesn't slip.
Once it stabilizes that, it lifts a foot,
Also for search and rescue applications as well.
We developed our adaptive gait planner.
And here you can see that it's walking over unstructured terrain.
but depending on the moisture content or the grain size of the sand,
It also does some fun stuff.
As you can imagine, we get so many visitors visiting our lab.
We do something to something,
Instead of using electrical motors, electromechanical actuators,
we're using compressed air.
simply just changing the air pressure.
And it can actually crush an empty soda can.
This is a HyDRAS's arm.
It's a 12-degrees-of-freedom robotic arm.
But the cool part is the user interface.
In this case, it's very intuitive;
We actually have a fan club for the robot, DARwIn:
Dynamic Anthropomorphic Robot with Intelligence.
so we decided to build a small humanoid robot.
This was in 2004; at that time,
this was something really, really revolutionary.
and external computation.
And the actual goal of RoboCup is,
by the year 2050,
This is for the best humanoid.
This is the next generation robot, DARwIn IV,
much smarter, faster, stronger.
And it's trying to show off its ability:
Where do we come up with these ideas?
How do we develop these kinds of ideas?
We have a fully autonomous vehicle
that can drive into urban environments.
And they assemble, and they form these kinds of mechanisms.
And I think, "Ah, this is cool."
So I need to decipher what I wrote.
But sometimes I see this ingenious idea in there,
and I have this eureka moment.
I directly run to my home office, sit at my computer,
I type in the ideas, I sketch things out
So when we have these calls for proposals,
we have these fantastic brainstorming sessions.
But before we start, we set this golden rule.
The rule is:
nobody criticizes anybody's ideas.
Nobody criticizes any opinion.
They have these wacky, cool, crazy, brilliant ideas,
Math, differential equations.
do not forget to have fun.
And there you go.
Thank you. I have two missions here today.
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.
And, secondly, to convince you
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.
(Laughter)
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.
It carries male sex cells
from one flower to another.
This gives us genetic diversity,
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,
so, it's quite prolific stuff.
And it isn't just bright flowers
that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,
but that's for the pollen tube
to come out later on. A very tiny tube.
So, that's 20 micrometers across,
that pollen grain there.
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.
which I've always thought to be rather tedious --
named after Morin,
who was an enterprising French gardener,
who issued the first seed catalog
in 1621.
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.
This is amazing, I think.
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,
and when the pollen finds its special female spot
in another Morina flower,
just on the right species, what happens?
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.
If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,
they have rampant, promiscuous
and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.
(Laughter) A lot.
but about pollen itself.
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.
It's also very biologically active,
as anyone with hay fever will understand.
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --
like trees and grasses and so on --
tend to cause the most hay fever.
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out
masses and masses of pollen to have any chance
of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.
they're very smooth if you look at them --
of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.
So, trees: very boring flowers,
not really trying to attract insects.
Cool pollen, though.
This one I particularly like.
This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks
to make the pollen carry even further.
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.
This is a bee's leg
with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.
And this is the outrageous and beautiful
flower of the mangrove palm.
Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.
The pollen has little barbs on it,
if we look.
Now, those little barbs
obviously stick to the insects well,
but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,
and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line
across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.
And I'm rather proud to say
that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago
London was full of mangroves.
Isn't that cool?
(Laughter)
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,
actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.
No coincidence that these were taken
by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,
and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye
like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.
(Laughter)
means that you can look at a pollen grain
and tell what species it came from,
and that's actually quite handy if you
maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.
So, different species of plants
grow in different places,
and some pollen carries further than others.
So, if you have a pollen sample,
then in principle, you should be able to tell
where that sample came from.
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.
So, not only does each type of pollen look different,
but each habitat has a different combination of plants.
A different pollen signature, if you like,
or a different pollen fingerprint.
By looking at the proportions and combinations
of different kinds of pollen in a sample,
you can tell very precisely where it came from.
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,
similar to the one that I'm wearing now.
Now, much of the pollen will still be there
after repeated washings.
Where has it been?
Four very different habitats might look similar,
but they've got very different pollen signatures.
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken
in different countries.
It's being used now to track
where counterfeit drugs have been made,
where banknotes have come from,
to look at the provenance of antiques
and see that they really did come from the place
the seller said they did.
And murder suspects have been tracked
using their clothing,
certainly in the U.K., to within an area
that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs
to find the murder victim.
So, you can tell from a piece of clothing
to within about a kilometer or so,
where that piece of clothing has been recently
and then send in dogs.
And finally, in a rather grizzly way,
the Bosnia war crimes;
some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial
because of the evidence from pollen,
which showed that bodies had been buried,
exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.
if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)
to some of pollen's secrets.
This is a horse chestnut.
There is an invisible beauty all around us,
each grain with a story to tell ...
each of us, in fact, with a story to tell
from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,
and thank you to palynologists everywhere.
(Applause)
It's not about technology,
it's about people and stories.
I could show you
what recently was on television
as a high quality video:
he had his hook and he had his --
because I think it's
the guy that runs DARPA,
the people that fund all the advanced technologies
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,
you know, before the dust clears,
if some soldier has been hurt
they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,
they will be getting world-class triage emergency care
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt
in a car accident in a major city in the United States.
That's the good news.
and if somebody loses an arm,
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."
and then the punchline: "So, Dean,
we're here because you make medical stuff.
You're going to give us an arm."
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,
paperwork and DODs.
and wearing the arm you're going to give us,
flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.
50th percentile female frame.
(Laughter)
Then, the surgeon says to me,
"Dean, you need to know
more than two dozen of these kids have come back
bilateral."
I can't imagine losing my arm,
But compared to that, losing two?
I literally could not sleep
Did a little investigation,
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,
and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.
that has all that capability in one year.
We sort of agreed to disagree.
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it
I then thought it would be years
It turned out, as I think you could see
He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,
and he's high trans-humeral on the other.
after 10 hours -- were playing in our office.
Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,
He picks up a spoon, picks it up,
holds the spoon level
as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,
to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.
(Laughter)
I cannot do that.
So, you've got a choice:
We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."
(Laughter) (Applause)
There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber
And just as in the spirit of FIRST,
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,
doing either of those.
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.
I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem
or frankly, this whole segment
of the medical world.
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,
the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality --
I put a bunch of guys in my plane
and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,
Department of Defense likes this arm."
When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,
but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.
There is only one opinion that matters,
We did see a bunch of people,
and parts they had left were burned;
And we started asking them all questions.
I can give you fast control
I can't give you both.
And we were trying to get them to all help us
"Well, would it help if I ..."
you've given enough.
You could see he was missing an arm.
And he said, "You know,
I'm the lucky guy at this table.
I lost my right arm,
but I'm a lefty."
(Laughter)
And he made a few comments.
And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.
"We didn't give them support and encouragement;
they gave it to us.
They're not finished giving yet."
So, we went back.
And I started working harder, faster.
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.
And it was astounding
and we've been working harder yet.
We're in clinical trials,
we've got five of them on people.
We're screaming along.
And he was there,
and they said we needed to come.
He's got no arms.
He's got a small residual limb on one side.
but they said his vision is coming back.
He had one good eye.
"I need your arms,
"You'll get them."
and it had a stick.
You think I'll be able to drive it?"
"Sure."
He doesn't really want a lot.
He wants to help. He told me that
he wanted to go back
to help his buddies.
There were 3,500 people,
some that have died, some that are
like Brandon --
still not as good at the original equipment."
"You need to come."
or concern I have.
but there were people there literally talking about,
You know, this country is involved as we've all heard,
Who is entitled to how much?
Those are tough questions.
There are other questions that are tough.
What do we need to do?" There's very polarized
and he was really liking this arm --
But I was saying to him, "You know,
the first airplane
went 100 feet in 1903.
And I said to that kid,
"I'll stop when your buddies
because of what it can do, and how it does it.
And we ought to give it to them.
"People do stupid things.
That's what spreads HIV."
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper,
The Guardian, not that long ago.
I'm curious, show of hands, who agrees with it?
Well, one or two brave souls.
who's been in field of HIV for 15 years,
worked on four continents,
and you're looking at her.
that this is only half true.
People do get HIV because they do stupid things,
but most of them are doing stupid things
for perfectly rational reasons.
Now, "rational" is the dominant paradigm
in public health,
and if you put your public health nerd glasses on,
you'll see that if we give people the information that they need
about what's good for them and what's bad for them,
if you give them the services
that they can use to act on that information,
and a little bit of motivation,
people will make rational decisions
and live long and healthy lives.
Wonderful.
and although I'm sure you all know
that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality,
and if you were at TED '07
it's about coffee prices ...
Actually, HIV's about sex and drugs,
and if there are two things that make
human beings a little bit irrational,
they are erections and addiction.
Now, I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine, Frankie.
We were having lunch and he was telling me
about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection.
It was someone's birthday, and they had very kindly
smuggled some heroin into jail,
and he was very generously sharing it out
with all of his colleagues.
And so everyone lined up,
all the smackheads in a row,
and the guy whose birthday it was
filled up the fit,
and he went down and started injecting people.
So he injects the first guy,
and then he's wiping the needle on his shirt,
and he injects the next guy.
And Frankie says, "I'm number 22 in line,
and I can see the needle coming down towards me,
and there is blood all over the place.
It's getting blunter and blunter.
And a small part of my brain is thinking,
'That is so gross
and really dangerous,'
but most of my brain is thinking,
'Please let there be some smack left
by the time it gets to me.
Please let there be some left.'"
And then, telling me this story,
Frankie said,
"You know ... God,
drugs really make you stupid."
But, actually, Frankie, at that time,
was a heroin addict and he was in jail.
So his choice was either
to accept that dirty needle or not to get high.
And if there's one place you really want to get high,
it's when you're in jail.
and I don't like to make data out of anecdotes,
so let's look at some data.
We talked to 600 drug addicts
in three cities in Indonesia,
and we said, "Well, do you know how you get HIV?"
"Oh yeah, by sharing needles."
I mean, nearly 100 percent. Yeah, by sharing needles.
And, "Do you know where you can get a clean needle
at a price you can afford to avoid that?"
"Oh yeah." Hundred percent.
"We're smackheads; we know where to get clean needles."
"So are you carrying a needle?"
We're actually interviewing people on the street,
in the places where they're hanging out and taking drugs.
"Are you carrying clean needles?"
One in four, maximum.
So no surprises then that
the proportion that actually used clean needles
every time they injected in the last week
is just about one in 10,
and the other nine in 10 are sharing.
everyone knows that
if they share they're going to get HIV,
but they're all sharing anyway.
So what's that about? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something?
We asked that to a junkie and they're like, "Are you nuts?"
You don't want to share a needle anymore than you want
to share a toothbrush even with someone you're sleeping with.
There's just kind of an ick factor there.
"No, no. We share needles because we don't want to go to jail."
So, in Indonesia at this time,
if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up,
they could put you into jail.
And that changes the equation slightly, doesn't it?
Because your choice now is either
I use my own needle now,
or I could share a needle now
and get a disease that's going to
possibly kill me 10 years from now,
or I could use my own needle now
and go to jail tomorrow.
And while junkies think that
it's a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV,
they think it's a much worse idea
to spend the next year in jail
where they'll probably end up in Frankie's situation
and expose themselves to HIV anyway.
So, suddenly it becomes perfectly rational
to share needles.
This is a really easy problem.
For once, your incentives are aligned.
We've got what's rational for public health.
You want people to use clean needles --
and junkies want to use clean needles.
So we could make this problem go away
simply by making clean needles universally available
and taking away the fear of arrest.
Now, the first person to figure that out
and do something about it on a national scale
was that well-known, bleeding heart liberal
Margaret Thatcher.
And she put in the world's first
national needle exchange program,
and other countries followed suit: Australia, The Netherlands and few others.
And in all of those countries, you can see,
not more than four percent of injectors
ever became infected with HIV.
Moscow, Jakarta --
we're talking, at its peak,
one in two injectors
infected with this fatal disease.
Now, Margaret Thatcher didn't do this
because she has any great love for junkies.
She did it because she ran a country
that had a national health service.
So, if she didn't invest in effective prevention,
she was going to have pick up the costs
of treatment later on,
and obviously those are much higher.
So she was making a politically rational decision.
Now, if I take out my
public health nerd glasses here
and look at these data,
it seems like a no-brainer, doesn't it?
But in this country,
where the government apparently does not feel compelled
to provide health care for citizens, (Laughter)
we've taken a very different approach.
So what we've been doing in the United States
is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data.
So, these are reviews of hundreds of studies
by all the big muckety-mucks
of the scientific pantheon in the United States,
and these are the studies that show
needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them.
Now, the ones that show that needle programs aren't effective --
you think that's one of these annoying dynamic slides
and I'm going to press my dongle and the rest of it's going to come up,
but no -- that's the whole slide.
So, completely irrational,
you would think.
Except that, wait a minute, politicians are rational, too,
and they're responding to what they think the voters want.
So what we see is that voters respond
very well to things like this
and not quite so well to things like this.
to deny services to injectors.
Now let's talk about sex.
Are we any more rational about sex?
Well, I'm not even going to address
the clearly irrational positions
of people like the Catholic Church,
who think somehow that if you give out condoms,
everyone's going to run out and have sex.
I don't know if Pope Benedict
watches TEDTalks online,
but if you do, I've got news for you Benedict --
I carry condoms all the time
and I never get laid.
(Laughter) (Applause)
It's not that easy!
Here, maybe you'll have better luck.
HIV is actually not that easy
to transmit sexually.
So, it depends on how much virus there is
in your blood and in your body fluids.
And what we've got is a very, very high level of virus
right at the beginning when you're first infected,
then you start making antibodies,
and then it bumps along at quite low levels
for a long time -- 10 or 12 years --
you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection.
But basically, nothing much is going on
until you start to get symptomatic AIDS,
and by that stage,
you're not looking great, you're not feeling great,
you're not having that much sex.
is essentially determined by how many partners you have
in these very short spaces of time
when you have peak viremia.
Now, this makes people crazy
because it means that you have to talk about
some groups having more sexual partners
in shorter spaces of time than other groups,
and that's considered stigmatizing.
I've always been a bit curious about that
because I think stigma is a bad thing,
whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing,
but we'll leave that be.
The truth is that 20 years
of very good research
have shown us that
there are groups that are more likely to turnover
large numbers of partners in a short space of time.
And those groups are, globally,
people who sell sex and their more regular partners.
They are gay men on the party scene
who have, on average, three times more partners
than straight people on the party scene.
And they are heterosexuals
who come from countries that have
traditions of polygamy
and relatively high levels of female autonomy,
and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa.
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today.
These are all countries in southern Africa
where between one in seven,
and one in three
of all adults,
are infected with HIV.
Now, in the rest of the world,
we've got basically nothing going on in the general population --
very, very low levels --
but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV
in these other populations who are at highest risk:
drug injectors, sex workers
and gay men.
And you'll note, that's the local data from Los Angeles:
25 percent prevalence among gay men.
Of course, you can't get HIV just by having unprotected sex.
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex
with a positive person.
these few prevention failures
notwithstanding,
we are actually doing quite well these days
in commercial sex:
condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent
in commercial sex in most countries.
And, again, it's because of an alignment of the incentives.
What's rational for public health
is also rational for individual sex workers
because it's really bad for business to have another STI.
No one wants it.
And, actually, clients don't want to go home with a drip either.
So essentially, you're able to achieve
quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex.
it's much more difficult because,
with your wife or your boyfriend
or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things,
we have this illusion of romance
and trust and intimacy,
and nothing is quite so unromantic
as the, "My condom or yours, darling?" question.
So in the face of that,
you really need quite a strong incentive
to use condoms.
He's from Haiti and he has AIDS.
And he's probably not having a lot of sex right now,
but he is a reminder in the population,
of why you might want to be
using condoms.
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder
of why you might want to be having sex, perhaps.
Now, funnily enough, this is also Joseph
after six months on antiretroviral treatment.
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect.
But it is changing the equation
of what's rational
in sexual decision-making.
So, what we've got --
some people say, "Oh, it doesn't matter very much
because, actually, treatment is effective prevention
because it lowers your viral load and therefore
makes it more difficult to transmit HIV."
So, if you look at the viremia thing again,
if you do start treatment when you're sick,
well, what happens? Your viral load comes down.
But compared to what? What happens if you're not on treatment?
Well, you die,
so your viral load goes to zero.
And all of this green stuff here, including the spikes --
which are because you couldn't get to the pharmacy,
or you ran out of drugs, or you went on a three day party binge
and forgot to take your drugs,
or because you've started to get resistance, or whatever --
all of that is virus
that wouldn't be out there, except for treatment.
Let's just stop treating people."
Of course not, of course not.
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can.
But what I am doing is calling into question
those people who say that more treatment
is all the prevention we need.
That's simply not necessarily true,
and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men
in rich countries where treatment has been widely available
for going on 15 years now.
And what we've seen is
that, actually, condom use rates,
which were very, very high --
the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV,
with extremely little help
from public health nerds, I would say --
that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment
for two reasons really:
One is the assumption of, "Oh well,
if he's infected, he's probably on meds,
and his viral load's going to be low, so I'm pretty safe."
not as scared of HIV
as they were of AIDS, and rightly so.
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you,
and HIV is an invisible virus
that makes you take a pill every day.
And that's boring,
but is it as boring as
having to use a condom every time you have sex,
no matter how drunk you are,
no matter how many poppers you've taken, whatever?
If we look at the data, we can see that
the answer to that question
is, mmm.
You see the peak in drug injectors
before they started the national needle exchange program.
Then it came way down.
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex --
and in drug users,
you've really got nothing much going on after treatment begins,
and that's because of that alignment of incentives
that I talked about earlier.
But in gay men,
you've got quite a dramatic rise
starting three or four years
after treatment became widely available.
This is of new infections.
It means that the combined effect of being less worried
and having more virus out there in the population --
more people living longer, healthier lives,
more likely to be getting laid
with HIV --
is outweighing the effects of lower viral load,
and that's a very worrisome thing.
What does it mean?
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have.
No, and I call it the "compassion conundrum."
We've talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days,
and what's happening really is that people are
unable quite to bring themselves to put in
good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers,
unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies.
But once they've gone from being
transgressive people whose behaviors we don't want to condone
to being AIDS victims,
we come over all compassionate
and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives.
It doesn't make any sense
from a public health point of view.
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta;
she's a chick with a dick.
Why does she do that job?
Well, of course, because she's forced into it
because she doesn't have any better option, etc., etc.
And if we could just teach her to sew
and get her a nice job in a factory, all would be well.
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia:
on average, 20 cents.
It varies a bit province to province.
I do speak to sex workers, 15,000 of them
for this particular slide,
and this is what sex workers
say they earn in an hour.
So it's not a great job, but for a lot of people
it really is quite a rational choice.
Okay, Ines.
and commitment to preventing HIV too.
It's all politics.
When you get to politics, nothing makes sense.
So, from the point of view of a sex worker,
politicians are making no sense.
From the point of view of a public health nerd,
junkies are doing dumb things.
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale.
There are as many different ways of being rational
as there are human beings on the planet,
and that's one of the glories of human existence.
But those ways of being rational
are not independent of one another,
so it's rational for
a drug injector to share needles
because of a stupid decision that's made by a politician,
and it's rational for a politician
to make that stupid decision
because they're responding to
what they think the voters want.
But here's the thing:
we are the voters.
We're not all of them, of course, but TED is a community of opinion leaders.
And everyone who's in this room,
and everyone who's watching this out there on the web,
I think, has a duty to demand of their politicians
that we make policy based on scientific evidence
and on common sense.
It's going to be really hard for us
to individually affect what's rational
for every Frankie and every Ines out there,
but you can at least use your vote
to stop politicians doing stupid things
that spread HIV.
Now, I want to start with a question:
being called childish can be a frequent occurrence.
Every time we make irrational demands,
exhibit irresponsible behavior,
we are called childish.
After all, take a look at these events:
Imperialism and colonization,
world wars, George W. Bush.
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.
Well, Anne Frank touched millions
with her powerful account of the Holocaust.
Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States.
And, most recently,
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.
Maybe you've had grand plans before,
but stopped yourself, thinking,
when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.
because you know that if everything were free,
you have to dream about it first.
helps push the boundaries of possibility.
For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,
my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!
and kids draw their own ideas for glass art.
or maybe Italian vases,
but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that,
The reality, unfortunately, is a little different,
and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.
I established on her last loan,
I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me,
to restrictions on school Internet use.
As history points out, regimes become oppressive
when they're fearful about keeping control.
And although adults may not be quite at the level
of totalitarian regimes,
kids have no or very little say in making the rules,
when really, the attitude should be reciprocal,
when lots of other kids were hearing
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."
Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.
and I wanted to get published.
or saying wait until you're older,
my parents were really supportive.
One large children's publisher ironically said
that they didn't work with children.
Children's publisher not working with children?
and to listen to what I had to say.
keynoting to thousands of educators,
of kids being so much better than adults.
Kids grow up and become adults just like you.
is because new generations and new eras
grow and develop and become better than the previous ones.
It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.
it is imperative to create opportunities for children,
so that we can grow up to blow you away.
you need to listen and learn from kids,
and trust us and expect more from us.
You must lend an ear today,
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you,
remember that cloning is possible,
and that involves going through childhood again,
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.
Are you ready to make the match?
So let's watch a movement happen, start to finish,
What he's doing is so easy to follow.
Here's his first follower with a crucial role;
he's going to show everyone else how to follow.
It takes guts to stand out like that.
Now it's not a lone nut, it's not two nuts --
three is a crowd, and a crowd is news.
So a movement must be public.
Now we've got momentum. This is the tipping point.
it's less risky.
And that's how you make a movement.
like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone,
did you catch it? --
is that leadership is over-glorified.
but it was really the first follower
that transformed the lone nut into a leader.
And what a perfect place to do that, at TED.
We are drowning in news.
Reuters alone puts out
three and a half million news stories a year.
That's just one source.
are actually going to matter in the long run?
That's the idea behind The Long News.
It's a project by The Long Now Foundation,
which was founded by TEDsters including
Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand.
And what we're looking for is news stories that might still matter
50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now.
And when you look at the news through that filter,
a lot falls by the wayside.
is this going to matter in a decade?
Or this?
Or this?
Really?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years?
Okay, that was kind of cool.
(Laughter)
But the top story of this past year was the economy,
and I'm just betting that, sooner or later,
this particular recession is going to be old news.
make a difference for the future?
Well, let's take science.
Someday, little robots will go
through our bloodstreams fixing things.
That someday is already here if you're a mouse.
Some recent stories:
nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom;
they're sending genes into the brain;
a robot they built that can crawl through the human body.
We're having trouble feeding six billion today.
As we heard yesterday, there's over a billion people hungry.
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops.
Bill Gates, fortunately, has bet a billion on [agricultural] research.
The world's going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda,
and they may.
They've overtaken the U.S. as the world's biggest car market,
they've overtaken Germany as the largest exporter,
and they've started doing DNA tests on kids
to choose their careers.
Some recent discoveries:
There's an ant colony from Argentina that has now
spread to every continent but Antarctica;
there's a self-directed robot scientist that's made a discovery --
soon, science may no longer need us,
and life may no longer need us either;
a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years.
It seems that with or without us,
life will go on.
was this one: water found on the moon.
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there.
And if NASA doesn't do it, China might,
or somebody in this room might write a big check.
In the long run, some news stories
are more important than others.
(Applause)
I'm standing in front of you today
in all humility,
wanting to share with you
my journey of the last six years
in the field of service
and education.
And I'm not a trained academic.
Neither am I a veteran social worker.
I was 26 years in the corporate world,
trying to make organizations profitable.
And then in 2003
I started Parikrma Humanity Foundation
from my kitchen table.
You know, by the way, there are two million people
in Bangalore, who live in 800 slums.
We couldn't go to all the slums,
but we tried to cover as much as we could.
We walked through these slums,
identified houses where children would never go to school.
We talked to the parents,
tried to convince them about sending their children to school.
We played with the children,
and came back home really tired,
exhausted, but with images
of bright faces, twinkling eyes,
and went to sleep.
but the numbers hit us then:
200 million children
between four to 14 that
should be going to school, but do not;
100 million children
who go to school but cannot read;
125 million who cannot do basic maths.
We also heard that 250 billion Indian rupees
was dedicated for government schooling.
Ninety percent of it was spent on teachers' salary
and administrators' salary.
And yet, India has nearly
the highest teacher absenteeism
in the world,
with one out of four teachers
not going to school at all the entire academic year.
overwhelming, and we were constantly asked,
"When will you start? How many schools will you start?
How many children will you get?
How are you going to scale?
How are you going to replicate?"
It was very difficult not to get scared, not to get daunted.
But we dug our heels
and said, "We're not in the number game.
We want to take one child at a time
and take the child right through school,
sent to college,
and get them prepared for better living,
a high value job."
The first Parikrma school
started in a slum
where there were 70,000 people
living below the poverty line.
Our first school was
on a rooftop of a building inside the slums,
a second story building, the only second story building
inside the slums.
And that rooftop did not have
any ceiling, only half a tin sheet.
That was our first school. One hundred sixty-five children.
Indian academic year begins in June.
So, June it rains, so many a times
all of us would be huddled under the tin roof,
waiting for the rain to stop.
My God! What a bonding exercise that was.
And all of us
that were under that roof are still here together today.
Then came the second school,
the third school, the fourth school
and a junior college.
In six years now,
we have four schools, one junior college,
1,100 children
coming from 28 slums
and four orphanages.
(Applause)
to send each of these kids, get them prepared
to be educated
but also to live peacefully,
contented in this conflict-ridden
chaotic globalized world.
Now, when you talk global
you have to talk English.
And so all our schools
are English medium schools.
But they know there is this myth
that children from the slums
cannot speak English well.
No one in their family has spoken English.
No one in their generation has spoken English.
But how wrong it is.

and Hardy Boys.
Although they are like
in different contexts,
one is magical, the other two are like investigation,
I like those books because
they have something special in them.
The vocabulary used in those books
and the style of writing.
I mean like once I pick up one book
I cannot put it down until I finish the whole book.
Even if it takes me four and a half hours,
or three and half hours to finish my book, I do it.

I like Ducati ZZ143,
because it is the fastest,
the world's fastest bike,
and I like Pulsar 220 DTSI
because it is India's fastest bike. (Laughter)
her father sells flowers on the roadside.
And this little boy has been coming to school for five years.
But isn't it strange that little boys all over the world
love fast bikes? (Laughter)
He hasn't seen one, he hasn't ridden one, of course,
but he has done a lot of research through Google search.
You know, when we started with our English medium schools
we also decided to adopt
the best curriculum possible,
the ICSE curriculum.
And again, there were people who laughed at me
and said, "Don't be crazy
choosing such a tough curriculum for these students.
They'll never be able to cope."
Not only do our children cope very well,
but they excel in it.
You should just come across to see
how well our children do.
parents from the slums
are not interested in their children going to school;
they'd much rather put them to work.
That's absolute hogwash.
All parents all over the world
want their children to lead a better life than themselves,
but they need to believe that change is possible.
for all our parents-teachers meeting.
Sometimes it's even 100 percent,
much more than many privileged schools.
Fathers have started to attend.
It's very interesting. When we started our school
the parents would give thumbprints in the attendance register.
Now they have started writing their signature.
The children have taught them.
It's amazing how much children can teach.
actually late last year,
we had a few mothers who came to us and said,
"You know, we want to learn how to read and write.
Can you teach us?" So, we started an afterschool
for our parents, for our mothers.
We had 25 mothers who came regularly
after school to study.
We want to continue with this program
and extend it to all our other schools.
So, you can imagine how traumatized
and how dysfunctional the houses are where our children come from.
We have to send the fathers to de-addiction labs
and when they come back,
most times sober, we have to find a job for them
so that they don't regress.
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook.
We have taught them nutrition, hygiene.
We have helped them set up the kitchen
and now they are supplying food to all our children.
They do a very good job because
their children are eating their food,
but most importantly this is the first time
they have got respect,
and they feel that they are doing something worthwhile.

We've started many programs
just to make sure that the child comes to school.

so the younger ones are not stopped from coming to school.
cannot integrate with mainstream.
Take a look at this little girl
who was one of the 28 children
from all privileged schools,
best schools in the country
that was selected for the Duke University
talent identification program
and was sent to IIM Ahmedabad.
it was such a pride for us to go to that camp.
Everybody was very friendly,
especially I got a lot of friends.
And I felt that my English has improved a lot
going there and chatting with friends.
There they met children who are
with a different standard and
a different mindset, a totally different society.
I mingled with almost everyone.
They were very friendly.
I had very good friends there,
who are from Delhi, who are from Mumbai.
Even now we are in touch through Facebook.
I've been like a totally different
mingling with people and all of those.
Before that I feel like I wasn't like this.
I don't even mingle, or start speaking with someone so quickly.
My accent with English improved a lot.
And I learned football, volleyball,
Frisbee, lots of games.
And I wouldn't want to go to Bangalore. Let me stay here.
Such beautiful food,
I enjoyed it. It was so beautiful.
I enjoyed eating food like
[unclear] would come and ask me,
"Yes ma'am, what you want?" It was so good to hear!

before she came to school.
And today she wants to be a neurologist.
They are really excelling.
There is an inter-school athletic competition
that is held every year
in Bangalore, where 5,000 children participate
from 140 best schools in the city.
We've got the best school award for three years successively.
And our children are coming back home
with bags full of medals, with lots of admirers and friends.
Last year there were a couple of kids
from elite schools that came
to ask for admissions in our school.
We also have our very own dream team.
Is it the exposure? We have professors
from MIT, Berkeley, Stanford,
Indian Institute of Science
who come and teach our children lots of scientific formulas,
experiments, much beyond the classroom.
Art, music are considered
therapy and mediums of expression.
We also believe that
it's the content that is more important.
It is not the infrastructure,
not the toilets, not the libraries,
but it is what actually happens in this school
that is more important.
Creating an environment of learning,
of inquiry, of exploration
is what is true education.
we had no idea which direction we were taking.
We didn't hire McKinsey to do a business plan.
But we know for sure that
what we want to do today is
take one child at a time,
not get bogged with numbers,
and actually see the child complete
the circle of life,
and unleash his total potential.
We do not believe in scale
because we believe in quality,
and scale and numbers will automatically happen.
We have corporates that have stood behind us,
and we are able to, now, open more schools.
But we began with the idea
of one child at a time.
He was begging
by a bus stop a few years ago,
got picked up and is now in an orphanage,
has been coming to school for the last four and a half months.
He's in kindergarten.
He has learned how to speak English.
We have a model by which kids can speak English
and understand English
in three month's time.
He can tell you stories in English
of the thirsty crow, of the crocodile
and of the giraffe.
And if you ask him what he likes to do
he will say, "I like sleeping.
I like eating. I like playing."
And if you ask him what he wants to do,
he will say, "I want to horsing."
Now, "horsing" is going for a horse ride.
So, Parusharam comes to my office every day.
He comes for a tummy rub,
because he believes that will give me luck. (Laughter)
I began with a great deal of arrogance
of transforming the world.
But today I have been transformed.
I have been changed with my children.
I've learned so much from them:
love, compassion, imagination
and such creativity.
Parusharam is Parikrma
with a simple beginning but a long way to go.
I promise you, Parusharam
will speak in the TED conference a few years from now.
Thank you.
(Applause)
So, basically we have public leaders,
public officials who are out of control;
they are writing bills that are unintelligible,
and out of these bills are going to come
maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,
which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam
you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;
if you're trying to get a small business loan,
you face a blizzard of paperwork.
as a means to achieving clarity,
transparency and empathy,
building humanity into communications.
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.
I come out of the advertising and design business.
My focus is understanding you people,
and how you interact with the government
to get your benefits,
how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,
and how you view brands.
"I don't see why we can't
have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."
So, I locked myself in a room,
figured out the content,
organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.
I've had this checked by the two top
consumer credit lawyers in the country.
This is a real thing.
Now, I went one step further and said,
"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers
and just have a paper document? Let's go online."
might need help in computation.
Working with the Harvard Business School,
you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:
If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,
the longer you take to pay out that loan,
you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment
it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?
But it's going to work. It's more effective
than just computational aids.
And what about terms like
"over the limit"?
Perhaps a stealth thing.
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.
you almost force the institution
to give the people a way, a default out of that,
and not put themselves at risk.
Plain English is about
changing the content.
And one of the things I'm most proud of
is this agreement for IBM.
It's a grid, it's a calendar.
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,
you have responsibilities.
Received very favorably by business.
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers
receives a notice from the IRS.
There are 200 million letters that go out.
Running through this typical letter that they had,
I ran it through my simplicity lab,
it's pretty unintelligible.
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover
70 percent of their transactions in plain English.
They have been tested in the laboratory.
When I run it through my lab,
this heat-mapping shows everything
is intelligible.
And the IRS has introduced the program.
that I want to bring to your attention.
There is a lot of discussion now
about a consumer financial protection agency,
how to mandate simplicity.
We see all this complexity.
It's incumbent upon us,
and this organization, I believe,
to make clarity, transparency
and empathy a national priority.
There is no way that we should allow government
to communicate the way they communicate.
There is no way we should do business
with companies that have agreements
with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.
I thank you.
One day, Los Angeles Times columnist
Steve Lopez was walking along
the streets of downtown Los Angeles
when he heard beautiful music.
And the source was a man,
an African-American man,
charming, rugged, homeless,
playing a violin that only had two strings.
because Steve's columns became the basis
for a book, which was turned into a movie,
with Robert Downey Jr. acting as Steve Lopez,
and Jamie Foxx as Nathaniel Anthony Ayers,
the Juilliard-trained double bassist
whose promising career was cut short
by a tragic affliction with paranoid schizophrenia.
Nathaniel dropped out of Juilliard, he suffered a complete breakdown,
and 30 years later he was living homeless
on the streets of Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
I encourage all of you to read Steve's book or to watch the movie
to understand not only the beautiful bond
that formed between these two men,
but how music helped shape that bond,
and ultimately was instrumental -- if you'll pardon the pun --
in helping Nathaniel get off the streets.
two years ago, at Walt Disney Concert Hall.
He had just heard a performance of Beethoven's First and Fourth symphonies,
and came backstage and introduced himself.
He was speaking in a very jovial and gregarious way
about Yo-Yo Ma and Hillary Clinton
and how the Dodgers were never going to make the World Series,
all because of the treacherous first violin passage work
in the last movement of Beethoven's Fourth Symphony.
And we got talking about music, and I got an email from Steve a few days later
saying that Nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me.
because when he was treated it was with shock therapy
and Thorazine and handcuffs,
and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life.
But as a result now, he is prone to
these schizophrenic episodes,
the worst of which can manifest themselves as
him exploding
and then disappearing for days,
wandering the streets of Skid Row,
exposed to its horrors, with the torment of his own mind
unleashed upon him.
when we started our first lesson at Walt Disney Concert Hall --
he had a kind of manic glint in his eyes,
he was lost.
And he was talking about
invisible demons and smoke,
and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep.
not for myself, but I was afraid
that I was going to lose him,
that he was going to sink into one of his states,
and that I would ruin his relationship with the violin
if I started talking about scales
and arpeggios and other exciting forms of
didactic violin pedagogy.
(Laughter)
So, I just started playing.
And I played the first movement of the Beethoven Violin Concerto.
I understood that there was a profound change
occurring in Nathaniel's eyes.
It was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical,
a chemical reaction, for which my playing the music
was its catalyst.
And Nathaniel's manic rage
was transformed into understanding,
a quiet curiosity and grace.
And in a miracle, he lifted his own violin
and he started playing, by ear,
certain snippets of violin concertos
which he then asked me to complete -- Mendelssohn,
Tchaikovsky, Sibelius.
And we started talking about music, from Bach
to Beethoven and Brahms,
Bruckner, all the B's,
from Bartók, all the way up to Esa-Pekka Salonen.
had an encyclopedic knowledge of music,
but he related to this music at a personal level.
He spoke about it with the kind of passion
and understanding that I share with my colleagues
in the Los Angeles Philharmonic.
And through playing music and talking about music,
this man had transformed
from the paranoid, disturbed man
that had just come from walking the streets
of downtown Los Angeles
to the charming, erudite,
brilliant, Juilliard-trained musician.
And for Nathaniel, music is sanity.
Because music allows him to take his thoughts
and delusions and shape them
through his imagination and his creativity,
into reality.
And that is an escape
from his tormented state.
And I understood that this was the very essence of art.
This was the very reason why we made music,
that we take something that exists within all of us
at our very fundamental core,
our emotions,
and through our artistic lens,
through our creativity, we're able to shape those emotions into reality.
And the reality of that expression
reaches all of us
and moves us, inspires and unites us.
music brought him back into a fold of friends.
The redemptive power of music brought him back
into a family of musicians
that understood him,
that recognized his talents
and respected him.
And I will always make music with Nathaniel,
whether we're at Walt Disney Concert Hall
or on Skid Row, because he reminds me
why I became a musician.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Robert Gupta.
(Applause)
So, please forgive me.
(Music)
(Applause)
I want to talk about 4.6 billion years of history
in 18 minutes.
That's 300 million years per minute.
Let's start with the first photograph NASA obtained
of planet Mars.
This is fly-by, Mariner IV.
It was taken in 1965.
When this picture appeared,
that well-known scientific journal,
The New York Times, wrote in its editorial,
"Mars is uninteresting.
It's a dead world. NASA should not spend
any time or effort studying Mars anymore."
Fortunately, our leaders in Washington
at NASA headquarters knew better
and we began a very extensive study
of the red planet.
"Is there life outside of Earth?"
I believe that Mars is the most likely target
for life outside the Earth.
I'm going to show you in a few minutes
some amazing measurements that suggest
there may be life on Mars.
But let me start with a Viking photograph.
This is a composite taken by Viking in 1976.
Viking was developed and managed at the
NASA Langley Research Center.
We sent two orbiters and two landers in the summer of 1976.
We had four spacecraft, two around Mars,
two on the surface --
an amazing accomplishment.
the surface of any planet.
This is a Viking Lander photograph
of the surface of Mars.
And yes, the red planet is red.
Mars is half the size of the Earth,
but because two-thirds of the Earth is covered by water,
the land area on Mars
is comparable to the land area on Earth.
So, Mars is a pretty big place even though it's half the size.
We have obtained topographic measurements
of the surface of Mars. We understand
the elevation differences.
Mars has the largest volcano in the solar system,
Olympus Mons.
Mars has the Grand Canyon
of the solar system, Valles Marineris.
Very, very interesting planet.
Mars has the largest
impact crater in the solar system,
Hellas Basin.
This is 2,000 miles across.
If you happened to be on Mars
when this impactor hit,
it was a really bad day on Mars.
(Laughter)
This is Olympus Mons.
This is bigger than the state of Arizona.
produce atmospheres and they produce oceans.
We're looking at Valles Marineris,
the largest canyon in the solar system,
superimposed on a map of the United States,
3,000 miles across.
One of the most intriguing features about Mars,
the National Academy of Science says
one of the 10 major mysteries of the space age,
is why certain areas of Mars
are so highly magnetized.
We call this crustal magnetism.
There are regions on Mars, where, for some reason --
we don't understand why at this point --
the surface is very, very highly magnetized.
The answer is no, there is no liquid water
on the surface of Mars today.
But there is intriguing evidence
that suggests that the early history of Mars
there may have been rivers
and fast flowing water.
Today Mars is very very dry.
We believe there's some water in the polar caps,
there are polar caps of North Pole and South Pole.
Here are some recent images.
This is from Spirit and Opportunity.
These images that show at one time,
there was very fast flowing water on the surface of Mars.
Why is water important? Water is important
because if you want life you have to have water.
Water is the key ingredient
in the evolution, the origin of life on a planet.
and a picture of Olympus Mons,
very similar features, glaciers.
So, this is frozen water.
This is ice water on Mars.
This is my favorite picture. This was just taken a few weeks ago.
It has not been seen publicly.
This is European space agency
Mars Express, image of a crater on Mars
and in the middle of the crater
we have liquid water, we have ice.
Very intriguing photograph.
which is 4.6 billion years ago,
4.6 billion years ago, Mars was very Earth-like.
Mars had rivers, Mars had lakes,
but more important Mars had planetary-scale oceans.
We believe that the oceans were in the northern hemisphere,
and this area in blue,
which shows a depression of about four miles,
was the ancient ocean area
on the surface of Mars.
Where did the ocean's worth of water on Mars go?
Well, we have an idea.
This is a measurement we obtained a few years ago
from a Mars-orbiting satellite called Odyssey.
Sub-surface water on Mars,
frozen in the form of ice.
And this shows the percent. If it's a blueish color,
it means 16 percent by weight.
Sixteen percent, by weight, of the interior
contains frozen water, or ice.
So, there is a lot of water below the surface.
in my opinion, we've obtained of Mars,
was released earlier this year
in the magazine Science.
And what we're looking at is the presence of the gas methane,
CH4, in the atmosphere of Mars.
And you can see there are three distinct regions of methane.
Why is methane important?
Because on Earth, almost all --
99.9 percent -- of the methane
is produced by living systems,
not little green men, but microscopic life
below the surface or at the surface.
We now have evidence
that methane is in the atmosphere of Mars,
a gas that, on Earth,
is biogenic in origin,
produced by living systems.
These are the three plumes: A, B1, B2.
and we know from geological studies
that these regions are the oldest regions on Mars.
In fact, the Earth and Mars
are both 4.6 billion years old.
The oldest rock on Earth is only 3.6 billion.
The reason there is a billion-year gap
in our geological understanding
is because of plate tectonics,
The crust of the Earth has been recycled.
We have no geological record prior
for the first billion years.
That record exists on Mars.
And this terrain that we're looking at
dates back to 4.6 billion years
when Earth and Mars were formed.
It was a Tuesday.
(Laughter)
where we've put our spacecraft on the surface of Mars.
Here is Viking I, Viking II.
This is Opportunity. This is Spirit.
This is Mars Pathfinder. This is Phoenix,
we just put two years ago.
Notice all of our rovers and all of our landers
have gone to the northern hemisphere.
That's because the northern hemisphere
is the region of the ancient
ocean basin.
There aren't many craters.
And that's because the water protected the basin
from being impacted by asteroids and meteorites.
But look in the southern hemisphere.
In the southern hemisphere there are impact craters,
there are volcanic craters.
Here's Hellas Basin,
a very very different place, geologically.
Look where the methane is, the methane is in a very
rough terrain area.
the mysteries on Mars that exist?
We asked this question 10 years ago.
We invited 10 of the top Mars scientists
to the Langley Research Center for two days.
We addressed on the board
the major questions that have not been answered.
And we spent two days deciding
how to best answer this question.
And the result of our meeting
was a robotic rocket-powered airplane we call ARES.
It's an Aerial Regional-scale Environmental Surveyor.
There's a model of ARES here.
This is a 20-percent scale model.
If any place in the world
can build an airplane to fly on Mars,
it's the Langley Research Center,
for almost 100 years
a leading center of aeronautics in the world.
We fly about a mile above the surface.
We cover hundreds of miles,
and we fly about 450 miles an hour.
We can do things that rovers can't do
and landers can't do:
We can fly above mountains, volcanoes, impact craters;
we fly over valleys;
we can fly over surface magnetism,
the polar caps, subsurface water;
and we can search for life on Mars.
as we fly through the atmosphere of Mars,
we transmit that journey,
the first flight of an airplane outside of the Earth,
we transmit those images back to Earth.
And our goal is to inspire the American public
who is paying for this mission through tax dollars.
But more important we will
inspire the next generation of scientists,
technologists, engineers and mathematicians.
And that's a critical area of national security
and economic vitality, to make sure
we produce the next generation
of scientists, engineers, mathematicians and technologists.
as it flies over Mars.
We preprogram it.
We will fly where the methane is.
We will have instruments aboard the plane
that will sample, every three minutes, the atmosphere of Mars.
We will look for methane
as well as other gasses
produced by living systems.
We will pinpoint where these gases emanate from,
because we can measure the gradient where it comes from,
and there, we can direct the next mission
to land right in that area.
In two words, very carefully.
The problem is we don't fly it to Mars,
we put it in a spacecraft
and we send it to Mars.
The problem is the spacecraft's
largest diameter is nine feet;
ARES is 21-foot wingspan, 17 feet long.
How do we get it to Mars?
We fold it,
and we transport it in a spacecraft.
And we have it in something called an aeroshell.
This is how we do it.
And we have a little video that describes the sequence.
Main engine start, and liftoff.
This is the spacecraft taking nine months
to get to Mars.
It enters the atmosphere of Mars.
A lot of heating,
frictional heating. It's going 18 thousand miles an hour.
A parachute opens up to slow it down.
The thermal tiles fall off.
The airplane is exposed to the atmosphere for the first time.
It unfolds.
The rocket engine begins.
we can rewrite the textbook on Mars
by making high-resolution measurements of the atmosphere,
looking for gases of biogenic origin,
looking for gases of volcanic origin,
studying the surface, studying the magnetism
on the surface, which we don't understand,
as well as about a dozen other areas.
How do we know we can do it?
Because we have tested ARES model,
several models in a half a dozen wind tunnels
at the NASA Langley Research Center for eight years,
under Mars conditions.
And, of equal importance
is, we test ARES in the Earth's atmosphere,
at 100,000 feet,
which is comparable to the density and pressure
of the atmosphere on Mars where we'll fly.
Now, 100,000 feet, if you fly cross-country to Los Angeles,
you fly 37,000 feet.
We do our tests at 100,000 feet.
This is a half-scale model.
This is a high-altitude helium balloon.
This is over Tilamook, Oregon.
We put the folded airplane on the balloon --
it took about three hours to get up there --
and then we released it on command
at 103,000 feet,
and we deploy the airplane and everything works perfectly.
And we've done
high-altitude and low-altitude tests,
just to perfect this technique.
I have a scale model here.
But we have a full-scale model
in storage at the NASA Langley Research Center.
We're ready to go. All we need is a check from NASA headquarters
(Laughter)
to cover the costs.
I'm prepared to donate my honorarium for today's talk
for this mission.
There's actually no honorarium for anyone for this thing.
This is the ARES team;
we have about 150 scientists, engineers;
where we're working with Jet Propulsion Laboratory,
Goddard Space Flight Center,
Ames Research Center and half a dozen major universities
and corporations in developing this.
And let me conclude by saying
not too far from here,
right down the road in Kittyhawk, North Carolina,
a little more than 100 years ago
history was made
when we had the first powered flight of an airplane on Earth.
We are on the verge right now
to make the first flight of an airplane
outside the Earth's atmosphere.
We are prepared to fly this on Mars,
rewrite the textbook about Mars.
If you're interested in more information,
we have a website that describes this exciting
and intriguing mission, and why we want to do it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil
is one of the major threats against our fauna,
especially birds,
and mainly to supply the pet market
with thousands of animals taken from nature every month,
and transported far from their origins,
to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.
all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil
withdraw from nature
almost 38 million animals every year,
a business worth almost two billion dollars.
The police intercepts
these huge cargos with live animals,
intended to supply the pet market,
or they seize the animals directly from the people's houses,
and this is how we end up, every month,
with thousands of seized animals.
we're going to follow Brad.
In the eyes of many people,
after the animals are seized,
they say, "Yay, justice has been served.
The good guys arrived,
took the cute, mistreated animals
from the hands of the evil traffickers,
and everyone lived happily ever after."
But did they? Actually, no,
and this is where many of our problems begin.
Because we have to figure out
what to do with all these animals.
to governmental triage facilities,
in which most of the cases,
the conditions are as bad as
with the traffickers.
In 2002, these centers received
45,000 animals,
of which 37,000 were birds.
And the police estimates that we seize
only five percent of what's being trafficked.
Some lucky ones -- and among them, Brad --
go to serious rehabilitation centers after that.
And in these places they are cared for.
They train their flying,
they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature,
and they are able to socialize
with others from the same species.
(Laughter)
The Brazil Ornithological Society --
so now we're talking only birds --
claims that we have too little knowledge
about the species in nature.
Therefore, it would be too risky
to release these animals,
both for the released and for the natural populations.
They also claim that we spend too many resources
in their rehabilitation.
Following this argument,
they suggest that all the birds
seized from non-threatened species
should be euthanized.
However, this would mean having killed
26,267 birds,
only in the state of São Paulo, only in 2006.
some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government --
believe there is an alternative.
We think that if and when the animals meet
certain criteria concerning their health,
behavior, inferred origin
and whatever we know about the natural populations,
then technically responsible releases are possible,
both for the well-being of the individual,
and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems,
because we will be returning genes for these populations --
which could be important for them
in facing environmental challenges --
and also we could be returning
potential seed dispersers, predators, preys, etc.
On the top, the turtles are just enjoying freedom.
(Laughter)
On the middle,
this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release.
And on the bottom, my personal favorite,
the little male over there,
four hours after his release
he was together with a wild female.
So, this is not new, people have been
doing this around the world.
But it's still a big issue in Brazil.
We believe we have performed
responsible releases.
We've registered released animals mating in nature
and having chicks.
So, these genes are indeed going back to the populations.
for the very lack of knowledge.
So, I say, "Let's study more, let's shed light on this issue,
let's do whatever we can."
I'm devoting my career to that.
And I'm here to urge each and every one of you
to do whatever is in your reach:
Talk to your neighbor, teach your children,
make sure your pet is from a legal breeder.
We need to act, and act now,
before these ones are the only ones left.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'm going to speak today about the relationship
between science and human values.
Now, it's generally understood that
questions of morality --
questions of good and evil and right and wrong --
are questions about which science officially has no opinion.
It's thought that science can help us
get what we value,
but it can never tell us what we ought to value.
And, consequently, most people -- I think most people
probably here -- think that science will never answer
the most important questions in human life:
questions like, "What is worth living for?"
"What is worth dying for?"
"What constitutes a good life?"
that this is an illusion -- that the separation between
science and human values is an illusion --
and actually quite a dangerous one
at this point in human history.
Now, it's often said that science
cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values,
because science deals with facts,
and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres.
It's often thought that there's no description
of the way the world is
that can tell us how the world ought to be.
But I think this is quite clearly untrue.
Values are a certain kind of fact.
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures.
Why don't we feel compassion for rocks?
It's because we don't think rocks can suffer. And if we're more
concerned about our fellow primates
than we are about insects, as indeed we are,
it's because we think they're exposed to a greater range
of potential happiness and suffering.
Now, the crucial thing to notice here
is that this is a factual claim:
This is something that we could be right or wrong about. And if we
have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity
and the possibilities of experience
well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects.
no version of human morality
and human values that I've ever come across
that is not at some point reducible
to a concern about conscious experience
and its possible changes.
Even if you get your values from religion,
even if you think that good and evil ultimately
relate to conditions after death --
either to an eternity of happiness with God
or an eternity of suffering in hell --
you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes.
And to say that such changes can persist after death
is itself a factual claim,
which, of course, may or may not be true.
in this life, for human beings,
we know that there is a continuum of such facts.
We know that it's possible to live in a failed state,
where everything that can go wrong does go wrong --
where mothers cannot feed their children,
where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration,
where people are murdered indiscriminately.
And we know that it's possible to move along this continuum
towards something quite a bit more idyllic,
to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable.
that there are right and wrong answers
to how to move in this space.
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea?
Probably not.
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye,
so that when bad things happened to them
they immediately blame their neighbors? Probably not.
There are truths to be known
about how human communities flourish,
whether or not we understand these truths.
And morality relates to these truths.
Now, of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels --
from the level of the genome
on up to the level of economic systems
and political arrangements.
But if we're going to talk about human well-being
we are, of necessity, talking about the human brain.
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it
is realized in the brain --
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife,
in this life, his personality --
his rather unfortunate personality --
is the product of his brain.
So the contributions of culture --
if culture changes us, as indeed it does,
it changes us by changing our brains.
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is
in how human beings flourish
can, at least in principle, be understood
in the context of a maturing science of the mind --
neuroscience, psychology, etc.
value's reduced to facts --
to facts about the conscious experience
of conscious beings.
And we can therefore visualize a space
of possible changes in the experience of these beings.
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape,
with peaks and valleys that correspond
to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures,
both personal and collective.
And one thing to notice is that perhaps
there are states of human well-being
that we rarely access, that few people access.
And these await our discovery.
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called
mystical or spiritual.
Perhaps there are other states that we can't access
because of how our minds are structured
but other minds possibly could access them.
that science is guaranteed to map this space,
or that we will have scientific answers to every
conceivable moral question.
I don't think, for instance, that you will one day consult
a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child,
or whether we should bomb Iran's nuclear facilities,
or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense.
(Laughter)
But if questions affect human well-being
then they do have answers, whether or not we can find them.
And just admitting this --
just admitting that there are right and wrong answers
to the question of how humans flourish --
will change the way we talk about morality,
and will change our expectations
of human cooperation in the future.
where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal,
where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board, hard,
and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin.
And hundreds of thousands of children, incidentally,
are subjected to this every year.
The locations of these enlightened districts, I think, will fail to surprise you.
We're not talking about Connecticut.
The creator of the universe himself
has told us not to spare the rod,
lest we spoil the child --
this is in Proverbs 13 and 20, and I believe, 23.
But we can ask the obvious question:
Is it a good idea, generally speaking,
to subject children to pain
and violence and public humiliation
as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development
and good behavior?
(Laughter)
Is there any doubt
that this question has an answer,
and that it matters?
that the notion of well-being is truly undefined,
and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed.
And so, how therefore can there be an
objective notion of well-being?
Well, consider by analogy, the concept of physical health.
The concept of physical health is undefined.
As we just heard from Michael Specter, it has changed over the years.
When this statue was carved
the average life expectancy was probably 30.
It's now around 80 in the developed world.
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes
in such a way that not being able to run a marathon
at age 200 will be considered a profound disability.
People will send you donations when you're in that condition.
(Laughter)
is open, genuinely open for revision,
does not make it vacuous.
The distinction between a healthy person
and a dead one
is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science.
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape:
There may be equivalent ways to thrive;
there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society
so as to maximize human flourishing.
undermine an objective morality?
Well think of how we talk about food:
I would never be tempted to argue to you
that there must be one right food to eat.
There is clearly a range of materials
that constitute healthy food.
But there's nevertheless a clear distinction
between food and poison.
The fact that there are many right answers
to the question, "What is food?"
does not tempt us
to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition.
Many people worry
that a universal morality would require
moral precepts that admit of no exceptions.
it must always be wrong to lie,
and if you can find an exception,
well then there's no such thing as moral truth.
Why would we think this?
Consider, by analogy, the game of chess.
Now, if you're going to play good chess,
a principle like, "Don't lose your Queen,"
is very good to follow.
But it clearly admits some exceptions.
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do.
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do.
And yet, chess is a domain of perfect objectivity.
The fact that there are exceptions here does not
change that at all.
that people are apt to make in the moral sphere.
Consider the great problem of women's bodies:
What to do about them?
Well this is one thing you can do about them:
You can cover them up.
Now, it is the position, generally speaking, of our intellectual community
that while we may not like this,
we might think of this as "wrong"
in Boston or Palo Alto,
who are we to say
that the proud denizens of an ancient culture
are wrong to force their wives and daughters
to live in cloth bags?
And who are we to say, even, that they're wrong
to beat them with lengths of steel cable,
or throw battery acid in their faces
if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way?
Who are we to pretend
that we know so little about human well-being
that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this?
I'm not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil --
women should be able to wear whatever they want, as far as I'm concerned.
But what does voluntary mean
in a community where,
when a girl gets raped,
her father's first impulse,
rather often, is to murder her out of shame?
Your daughter gets raped,
and what you want to do is kill her.
What are the chances that represents
a peak of human flourishing?
perfect solution in our own society.
For instance,
this is what it's like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere
in the civilized world.
Now, granted, for many men
it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images.
(Laughter)
But if we are in a reflective mood,
we can ask,
"Is this the perfect expression
of psychological balance
with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women's bodies?"
I mean, is this the optimal environment
in which to raise our children?
Probably not. OK, so perhaps there's some place
on the spectrum
between these two extremes
that represents a place of better balance.
(Applause)
Perhaps there are many such places --
there may be many peaks on the moral landscape.
But the thing to notice is that there will be
many more ways not to be on a peak.
Now the irony, from my perspective,
is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me
and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions
are religious demagogues of one form or another.
because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind,
not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes
and condition of human and animal well-being.
In fact, the endurance of religion
as a lens through which most people view moral questions
has separated most moral talk
from real questions of human and animal suffering.
This is why we spend our time
talking about things like gay marriage
and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation
or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue.
But the demagogues are right about one thing: We need
a universal conception of human values.
Well, one thing to notice is that we
do something different when talking about morality --
especially secular, academic, scientist types.
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion
in a way that we don't in any other area of our lives.
So, for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning
meditating on compassion,
and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component
of human happiness.
On the other hand, we have someone like Ted Bundy;
Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping
and torturing and killing young women.
about how to profitably use one's time.
(Laughter)
Most Western intellectuals
look at this situation
and say, "Well, there's nothing for the Dalai Lama
to be really right about -- really right about --
or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about
that admits of a real argument
that potentially falls within the purview of science.
He likes chocolate, he likes vanilla.
There's nothing that one should be able to say to the other
that should persuade the other."
Notice that we don't do this in science.
He's a string theorist.
If you ask the smartest physicists around
who is the smartest physicist around,
in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten.
The other half will tell you they don't like the question.
(Laughter)
So, what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference
and said,"String theory is bogus.
It doesn't resonate with me. It's not how I chose to
view the universe at a small scale.
I'm not a fan."
(Laughter)
Well, nothing would happen because I'm not a physicist;
I don't understand string theory.
I'm the Ted Bundy of string theory.
(Laughter)
I wouldn't want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member.
Whenever we are talking about facts
certain opinions must be excluded.
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise.
That is what it is for knowledge to count.
How have we convinced ourselves
that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise,
or moral talent, or moral genius even?
How have we convinced ourselves
that every opinion has to count?
How have we convinced ourselves
that every culture has a point of view
on these subjects worth considering?
Does the Taliban
have a point of view on physics
that is worth considering? No.
(Laughter)
How is their ignorance any less obvious
on the subject of human well-being?
(Applause)
It needs people like ourselves to admit
that there are right and wrong answers
to questions of human flourishing,
and morality relates
to that domain of facts.
It is possible
for individuals, and even for whole cultures,
to care about the wrong things,
which is to say that it's possible for them
to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead
to needless human suffering.
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality.
We live in a world in which
the boundaries between nations mean less and less,
and they will one day mean nothing.
and this technology cannot be uninvented;
it will always be easier
to break things than to fix them.
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious
that we can no more
respect and tolerate
vast differences in notions of human well-being
than we can respect or tolerate vast differences
in the notions about how disease spreads,
or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
We simply must converge
on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life.
And to do that, we have to admit that these questions have answers.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world,
hearing some of this, may well be doing the
screaming-with-rage thing, after as well, some of them.
When you're talking about the veil,
you're talking about women dressed in cloth bags.
I've lived in the Muslim world, spoken with a lot of Muslim women.
And some of them would say something else. They would say,
"No, you know, this is a celebration
of female specialness,
it helps build that and it's a result of the fact that" --
and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view --
"that male lust is not to be trusted."
I mean, can you engage in a conversation
with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist?
watching the clock ticking,
but the question is:
What is voluntary in a context
where men have certain expectations,
and you're guaranteed to be treated in a certain way
if you don't veil yourself?
And so, if anyone in this room
wanted to wear a veil,
or a very funny hat, or tattoo their face --
I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want,
but we have to be honest about
the constraints that these women are placed under.
And so I think we shouldn't be so eager
to always take their word for it,
especially when it's 120 degrees out
and you're wearing a full burqa.
concept of moral progress.
But can you reconcile that?
I think I understood you to say that you could
reconcile that with a world that doesn't become
one dimensional, where we all have to think the same.
Paint your picture of what
rolling the clock 50 years forward,
100 years forward, how you would like to think of
the world, balancing moral progress
with richness.
that we are on the path toward understanding our minds
at the level of the brain in some important detail,
then you have to admit
that we are going to understand all of the positive
and negative qualities
of ourselves in much greater detail.
So, we're going to understand positive social emotion
like empathy and compassion,
and we're going to understand the factors
that encourage it -- whether they're genetic,
whether they're how people talk to one another,
whether they're economic systems,
and insofar as we begin to shine light on that
we are inevitably going to converge
on that fact space.
It's not going to be like
veiling my daughter from birth
is just as good as teaching her
to be confident and well-educated
in the context of men who do desire women.
I mean I don't think we need an NSF grant to know
that compulsory veiling is a bad idea --
but at a certain point
we're going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved
and actually interrogate them.
Do people love their daughters
just as much in these systems?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that.
are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment
on some of these issues?
that you can love someone
in the context of a truly delusional belief system.
So, you can say like, "Because I knew my gay son
was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend,
I chopped his head off. And that was the most compassionate thing I could do."
If you get all those parts aligned,
yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love.
But again, then we have to talk about
well-being in a larger context.
It's all of us in this together,
not one man feeling ecstasy
and then blowing himself up on a bus.
continue for hours.
We don't have that, but maybe another time. Thank you for coming to TED.
(Applause)
So, I was just asked to go and shoot this film called "Elizabeth."
And we're all talking about this great English icon and saying,
"She's a fantastic woman, she does everything.
How are we going to introduce her?"
somebody said, "Bollywood."
Maybe Elizabeth, this great icon, dancing?
What are you talking about?"
So I rethought the whole thing,
and then we all came to a consensus.
And here was the introduction of this
(Music)
So how many people who saw the film did not get
that here was a woman in love,
that she was completely innocent
and saw great joy in her life, and she was youthful?
That's the power of visual storytelling,
that's the power of dance, that's the power of music:
You know, simple words lost
in the quicksand of experience.
So I come up, and I say,
It's my one way of getting rid of my mind,
getting rid of this mind that says,
and be in complete panic.
It's a symbolic gesture. I tear up the script,
I go and I panic myself, I get scared.
I'm doing it right now; you can watch me. I'm getting nervous,
I don't know what to say, I don't know what I'm doing, I don't want to go there.
"You know what you're going to do, sir." I say, "Of course I do."
"Hey, look at Shekhar. He's so prepared."
I'm allowing myself to go into chaos
All preparation is preparation.
I don't even know if it's honest.
I don't even know if it's truthful.
The truth of it all comes on the moment, organically,
and if you get five great moments
of great, organic stuff
in your storytelling, in your film,
your film, audiences will get it.
200 people at seven in the morning
"Hey. What's the first thing? What's going to happen?"
And you put yourself into a state of panic
where you don't know, and so you don't know.
And so, because you don't know,
you're praying to the universe because you're praying to the universe
that something -- I'm going to try and access the universe
the way Einstein -- say a prayer --
accessed his equations,
the same source. I'm looking for the same source
because creativity comes from absolutely the same source
that you meditate somewhere outside yourself,
outside the universe.
You're looking for something that comes and hits you.
"You're a great actor, and I like to give to my actors --
What am I doing? I'm trying to buy time.
I'm trying to buy time.
Get out of it, get it out.
And let's go to the universe because
there's something out there that is more
truthful than your mind,
that is more truthful than your universe.
because that's what I follow constantly
to find the shunyata somewhere, the emptiness.
Out of the emptiness comes a moment of creativity.
So that's what I do.
You remember how India was. There was no pollution.
In Delhi, we used to live -- we used to call it a chhat or the khota.
Khota's now become a bad word. It means their terrace --
and we used to sleep out at night.
At school I was being just taught about physics,
and I was told that
if there is something that exists,
then it is measurable.
If it is not measurable,
it does not exist.
And at night I would lie out, looking at the unpolluted sky,
as Delhi used to be at that time when I was a kid,
and I used to stare at the universe and say,
"How far does this universe go?"
And I would think, "Daddy, how far does the universe go?"
because in school they're teaching me
that if I cannot measure it, it does not exist.
It doesn't come into my frame of reference."
So, how far does eternity go?
What does forever mean?
And I would lie there crying at night
because my imagination could not touch creativity.
At that time, at the tender age of seven,
I created a story.
What was my story?
And I don't know why, but I remember the story.
There was a woodcutter
who's about to take his ax and chop a piece of wood,
and the whole galaxy is one atom of that ax.
And when that ax hits that piece of wood,
that's when everything will destroy
and the Big Bang will happen again.
is one atom in the ax of another woodcutter.
So every time, I could tell my story again and again
and get over this problem,
and so I got over the problem.
So what is a story?
A story is our -- all of us --
we are the stories we tell ourselves.
In this universe, and this existence,
where we live with this duality
of whether we exist or not
and who are we,
the stories we tell ourselves are the stories
that define the potentialities
of our existence.
A story is the relationship
that you develop between who you are,
or who you potentially are,
and the infinite world, and that's our mythology.
and a person without a story does not exist.
and followed his stories and came up with theories
and came up with theories and then came up with his equations.
Alexander had a story that his mother used to tell him,
and he went out to conquer the world.
We all, everybody, has a story that they follow.
We tell ourselves stories.
So, I will go further, and I say,
"I tell a story, and therefore I exist."
I exist because there are stories,
and if there are no stories, we don't exist.
we probably go mad.
I don't know; I'm not sure, but that's what I've done all the time.
A film tells a story.
that are given to a director --
if he had music, if he had visuals, if he had a video camera --
would we get Buddhism better?
But that puts some kind of burden on me.
I have to tell a story
in a much more elaborate way,
but I have the potential.
It's called subtext.
When I first went to Hollywood, they said --
I used to talk about subtext, and my agent came to me,
"Would you kindly not talk about subtext?"
Just talk about plot
and say how wonderful you'll shoot the film,
what the visuals will be."
here's what we look for:
We look for a story on the plot level,
then we look for a story
on the psychological level,
then we look for a story on the political level,
then we look at a story
on a mythological level.
And I look for stories on each level.
Now, it is not necessary
that these stories agree with each other.
What is wonderful is,
at many times, the stories will contradict with each other.
So when I work with Rahman who's a great musician,
I often tell him, "Don't follow what the script already says.
Find that which is not.
Find the truth for yourself,
and when you find the truth for yourself,
the writer was telling:
A woman who was threatened
by Philip II
and was going to war,
she was giving up the reasons she was a queen,
and then Walter Raleigh
fell in love with her lady in waiting,
The gods up there,
there were two people.
There was Philip II, who was divine
because he was always praying,
and there was Elizabeth, who was divine,
But the divine one was unjust,
so the gods said,
"OK, what we need to do is
help the just one."
And so they helped the just one.
And what they did was, they sent Walter Raleigh down
to physically separate her mortal self
from her spirit self.
And the mortal self was the girl
that Walter Raleigh was sent,
and gradually he separated her
so she was free to be divine.
And the two divine people fought,
and the gods were on the side of divinity.
They said, "We won the Armada."
The gods sent the storm."
I was trying to find a mythic reason
to make the film.
Of course, when I asked Cate Blanchett, I said, "What's the film about?"
She said, "The film's about a woman
coming to terms with growing older."
Psychological.
The writer said "It's about history, plot."
I said "It's about mythology,
the gods."
a piece from that film --
and how a camera also --
so this is a scene, where in my mind,
she was at the depths of mortality.
She was discovering what mortality actually means,
and if she is at the depths of mortality,
what really happens.
And she's recognizing the dangers of mortality
and why she should break away from mortality.
Remember, in the film, to me,
both her and her lady in waiting
were parts of the same body,
one the mortal self
and one the spirit self.
Bess?
Bess Throckmorton?
Are you with child?
Are you with child?
You dare to keep secrets from me?
You ask my permission before you rut,
before you breed.
My bitches wear my collars.
Do you hear me? Do you hear me?
You go to your traitor brother and leave me to my business.
Is it his?
Tell me. Say it. Is the child his? Is it his?
My lady,
it is my husband's child.
Elizabeth: Bitch! (Cries)
This is not the queen I love and serve.
and she has married without royal consent.
These offenses are punishable by law. Arrest him.
Go.
You no longer have the queen's protection.
Get out.
Elizabeth has realized,
and she's coming face-to-face
with her own sense of jealousy,
her own sense of mortality.
What am I doing with the architecture?
The architecture is telling a story.
there is the other, the architecture's bigger.
Not only that, why is the camera looking down?
The camera's looking down at her because she's in the well.
She's in the absolute well
from the depths of mortality,
come in, release her spirit.
And that's the moment where, in my mind,
both Elizabeth and Bess are the same person.
But that's the moment
she's surgically removing herself from that.
So the film is operating on
many many levels in that scene.
And how we tell stories
visually, with music, with actors,
and at each level it's a different sense
and sometimes contradictory to each other.
What's the process of telling a story?
I heard this little thing from a politician,
not a politician that was very well respected in India.
And he said that these people in the cities,
in one flush, expend as much water
as you people in the rural areas
don't get for your family for two days.
That struck a chord, and I said, "That's true."
I went to see a friend of mine,
and he made me wait
in his apartment in Malabar Hill
on the twentieth floor,
which is a really, really upmarket area in Mumbai.
And he was having a shower for 20 minutes.
I got bored and left, and as I drove out,
I drove past the slums of Bombay,
as you always do,
waiting for a tanker
to come and give them water.
And an idea started to develop.
So how does that become a story?
I suddenly realized that we are heading towards disaster.
which means water.
And now, out of the mythology of that,
I'm starting to create a world.
What kind of world do I create,
and where does the idea, the design of that come?
So, in my mind, in the future,
they started to build flyovers.
You understand flyovers? Yeah?
They started to build flyovers
to get from A to B faster,
but they effectively went from one area of relative wealth
to another area of relative wealth.
And then what they did was
they created a city above the flyovers.
And the rich people moved to the upper city
and left the poorer people in the lower cities,
about 10 to 12 percent of the people
have moved to the upper city.
There's a mythology in India about --
where they say, and I'll say it in Hindi,
[Hindi]
Right. What does that mean?
It says that the rich are always sitting on the shoulders
and survive on the shoulders of the poor.
they suck up all the water.
Remember the word I said, suck up.
They suck up all the water, keep to themselves,
and they drip feed the lower city.
And if there's any revolution, they cut off the water.
And, because democracy still exists,
there's a democratic way in which you say
"Well, if you give us what [we want], we'll give you water."
But I can go on about telling you
how we evolve stories,
and how stories effectively are who we are
and how these get translated into the particular discipline
that I am in, which is film.
But ultimately, what is a story? It's a contradiction.
Everything's a contradiction.
The universe is a contradiction.
And all of us are constantly looking for harmony.
When you get up, the night and day is a contradiction.
But you get up at 4 a.m.
That first blush of blue is where the night and day
are trying to find harmony with each other.
Harmony is the notes that Mozart didn't give you,
It's the effect of looking for harmony
in the contradiction that exists in a poet's mind,
a contradiction that exists in a storyteller's mind.
In a storyteller's mind, it's a contradiction of moralities.
In a poet's mind, it's a conflict of words,
in the universe's mind, between day and night.
In the mind of a man and a woman,
we're looking constantly at
the contradiction between male and female,
we're looking for harmony within each other.
The problem with a lot of the storytelling in Hollywood
and many films, and as [unclear] was saying in his,
that we try to resolve the contradiction.
Harmony is not resolution.
Harmony is the suggestion of a thing
that is much larger than resolution.
Harmony is the suggestion of something
that is embracing and universal
It is finite; harmony is infinite.
So that storytelling, like all other contradictions in the universe,
is looking for harmony and infinity
in moral resolutions, resolving one, but letting another go,
letting another go and creating a question that is really important.
(Applause)
There's an old saying, "Just because you can't see something,
doesn't mean it's not there."
My work is -- it's a reflection of myself.
What I wanted to do is to
show the world that the little things
can be the biggest things.
We all seem to think that,
you know, if we look down on the ground, there's nothing there.
And we use the word "nothing."
Nothing doesn't exist, because there is always something.
My mother told me that, when I was a child,
that I should always respect the little things.
This all started when I was age five.
What made me do it? At school, I will admit this:
academically, I couldn't express myself.
So I was, more or less, classed as "nothing."
My world was seen as less.
So I decided I didn't really want to be a part of that world.
I thought, I need to retreat
into something else.
So when my mother used to take me to school,
she thought I was at school,
and I used to do a U-turn, when her back was turned,
and run off and hide in the shed at the back of the garden.
and my mother suspected something,
thinking I was at school.
My mother was like the woman in Tom and Jerry.
So you'd just see her feet.
(Laughter)
So I was hiding in the shed, like that.
And all of a sudden ...
And then I saw her legs.
And then she said -- grabbed me like that, because my mother was quite big --
and she lifted me up and she says,
"How come you're not at school?"
I told her I couldn't face it because the way
the teacher was treating me, ridiculing me,
and using me as an example of failure.
So I told her.
At that age, obviously, I couldn't express it that way,
but I told her I didn't feel right.
And then she just said, "You're going back to school tomorrow."
And walked off. And I didn't expect that,
because I expected one of these ...
But I didn't get it.
And as I looked down on the ground,
I noticed there was some ants running around.
And I went into this little fantasy world.
And I thought,
"These ants, are they looking for the queen ant?
Or do they need somewhere to live?"
So I thought "Perhaps,
if I made these ants some apartments,
they'll move in."
(Laughter)
So I did.
And how I set about that, I got some splinters of wood.
And I sliced the little splinters of wood with a broken shard of glass,
constructed this little apartment.
Well it looked like a little shanty shed when I'd finished.
But I thought, perhaps the ant won't know, it'll probably move in.
And so they did.
That was a bit crude, at the time. And I made all these little apartments
And all I could hear was "Is this for us?"
And they moved in, and decided not to pay me any rent.
(Laughter)
And from there I was watching this little world.
It became part of me.
I wanted to experiment with this world
that we can't see.
So I realized that there was more to life
than just everything that we see around us that's huge.
So I started to educate myself on this molecular level.
And as I got older, I continued. I showed my mother.
My mother told me to take it smaller.
And I'll explain.
As you can see,
that's a pinhead.
The gentleman who commissioned me to do this
was a gentleman called Peter Huf.
And he says to me "Willard, can you put my house on a pinhead?"
"I don't believe you can do it. Can you really do it?"
And then he said, "But I don't believe that you can do this." So I said, "OK."
I went home, went underneath the microscope,
and I crushed up a piece of glass,
crushed it up.
And underneath the microscope
there were splinters of glass.
Some of them were quite jagged.
So I was crushing up these pieces of glass,
which, as you can see,
that's the actual frame of the house.
And the actual roof is made up of a fiber,
which I found in my sister's old teddy bear.
(Laughter)
So I got the teddy bear and I said,
"Do you mind if I pull out one of your fibers?"
So I did.
And I looked at it beneath the microscope. And some of it was flat.
So I decided to slice these up
with the tool that I make
by -- I sharpen the end of a needle into a blade.
And then I actually
slow down my whole nervous system.
And then I work between my heartbeat,
I have one-and-a-half seconds
to actually move.
And at the same time I have to watch I don't inhale
my own work, at the same time.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Because that has happened to me.
I found these little bits of glass.
And I had to make them square.
So I'm thinking "How can I do this?"
So what I did, I got an oilstone. Broke the edge of an oilstone off.
And what I did, I took pieces of glass. And I started to rub them.
I used a little tweezer which I made from a hair clip.
And I built rubber around the end of the tweezer so it wouldn't crush the glass.
And then I started rubbing, very very gently,
till some of the edges were quite square. And then I constructed it.
And how I constructed it,
is by making grooves in the top of the pinhead.
And then pushing the glass in with its own friction.
And as I was doing it, what happened?
The instrument that I used turned into a catapult.
And it went like this ...
And then that was it.
So I'm thinking, "Mr. Huf isn't going to be very happy
when I told him his house has gone to another,
into the atmosphere somewhere."
So to cut the story short,
I decided that I had to go back and do it.
So I found some more. And I decided to, sort of,
construct it very, very slowly,
holding my breath, working between my heartbeat,
and making sure everything is leveled.
Because it's such a small sculpture,
nothing can go wrong.
And I decided to build it up.
Then I used fibers out of my jumper,
which I held and stretched.
And made the beams going around the house.
And the actual windows and the balcony
had to be sort of constructed.
I used a money spider's web
to actually attach certain things,
which sent me insane.
But I managed to do it.
And when I finished it, I came back the next day.
I noticed that the house was occupied.
Have we ever heard of a dust mite?
Darren dust mite and his family moved in.
And there you are.
Bart Simpson is having a little argument.
I think they're arguing about the space on the pin.
There's not enough room for the two of them.
So I didn't think he was going to throw Bart off.
I think he was just warning him actually.
But this one was made out of a nylon tag
out of my shirt.
What I did, I plucked the tag out
and put it underneath the microscope.
I used the needle which has got a slight blade on the end.
Can anybody see the blade on the end of that needle?
just kind of hold my breath
and just work away very, very slowly,
manipulating the plastic, cutting it, because it behaves different.
Whenever you work on that level, things behave different.
Because it's on this molecular level things change
and they act different.
And sometimes they turn into little catapults and things go up in the air.
And, you know, all different things happen.
But I had to make a little barrier, going around it, out of cellophane,
to stop it moving.
Then static electricity set in.
And it went ...
And I'm trying to remove it. And the static is interfering with everything.
So there is sweat dripping off my head,
because I have to carve Homer Simpson like that, in that position.
And after I've cut out the shape,
then I have to make sure that there is room for Bart's neck.
then I have to paint it.
And after I've actually sculpted them,
I have to paint them.
I experimented with a --
I found a dead fly.
And I plucked the hair off the fly's head.
Decided to make a paintbrush.
(Laughter)
But I would never do it to a living fly.
(Laughter)
Because I've heard a fly in pain.
And they go "Meow! Ow!"
Even though they get on our nerves,
I would never kill an insect
because, "All creatures great and small" --
there is a hymn that says that.
So what I decided to do
is to pluck fine hair out of my face.
And I looked at it underneath the microscope.
That was the paintbrush.
And whilst I'm painting I have to be very careful,
because the paint starts to turn into little blobs.
And it starts to dry very quickly.
So I have to be very quick.
If I'm not, it will end up looking
not like what it's supposed to look like.
It could end up looking like Humpty Dumpty or somebody else.
So I have to be very very careful.
I would say, six to seven weeks.
My work, rough estimate,
sometimes five, six to seven weeks;
you can't always anticipate.
(Applause)
As you can see,
that's Charlton Heston brought down to size.
(Laughter)
He says to me, "Willard" --
You can see him saying, "Why me?"
I says, "I enjoyed your film. That's why."
As you can see, there's an aphid fly there.
That's just to show the scale
and the actual size of the sculpture.
I would say it probably measures ...
a quarter of a millimeter.
In America they say a period stop.
So say if you cut a period stop in half,
a full stop, that's about the size of the whole thing.
It's made -- the chariot is made of gold.
which I took out of the air.
When the sunlight comes through the window you see these little fibers.
And what I normally do is walk 'round a room --
(Laughter) --
trying to find one. And then I put it underneath the microscope.
I remember one time I was doing it, and the window was open.
And there was a lady standing by the bus stop.
And she saw me walking around like this.
(Laughter)
And then she looked at me.
And then I went ...
And then she went, "Hmm, OK, he's not mad."
Yeah, to actually do this thing --
the actual chariot is made of gold.
I had a 24-karat gold ring.
And I cut off a little flake of gold.
And I bent it 'round,
and made it into the chariot.
And the horse is made from nylon.
And the spider's web is for the reins on the horse.
To get the symmetrical shape of the horse
was very difficult,
because I had to get the horse to rear up
and look as though it was in some kind of action.
a gentleman seen it and said to me,
"There's no way you can do this, you must have used some kind of machine.
There's no way a man can do that.
It must be a machine."
So I says, "OK then, if you say it's a machine ..."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
That one took me approximately six weeks.
(Applause)
This one, I would say,
was a serious challenge.
(Laughter)
Because I had to put the torch on the top.
That one is, more or less, the same type of process.
The bottom of it is carved from a grain of sand,
because I wanted to get a bit of the stone effect.
I used a microscopic shard of diamond
to actually carve the actual base.
Well, I can look at this one and I can be very proud of this,
because that statue has always sort of
kept an image in my head of, you know,
the beginning of people coming to America.
So it's sort of Ellis Island, and seeing America for the first time.
And that's the first thing they saw.
So I wanted to have that little image.
And this is it.
(Laughter)
I wanted to create movement in the eye of a needle.
Because we know we see needles,
but people aren't familiar with the eye of a needle
apart from putting a thread through it.
So I broke the needle.
And made a needle look like
the Hulk's broken it.
It's -- I had to make little holes
in the base of the needle, to shove his feet in.
So most of my work, I don't use glue.
They go in with their own friction.
And that's how I managed to do it.
As you can see, he's looking at the moment. He's got a little grimace on his face.
And his mouth must be probably about
three microns.
So the eyes are probably about one micron or something.
that's made from 24-karat gold.
And I normally rig it with the web of a money spider.
But I had to rig it with strands of glue.
Because the web of the spider, it was sending me insane,
because I couldn't get the web to move off.
And that's 24-karat gold. And it's constructed. I built it.
Constructed each plank of gold.
And the whole thing is sort of symmetrical.
The flag had to be made out of little strands of gold.
It's almost like doing a surgical operation to get this thing right.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
It's something I wanted to do just to show how I could get the symmetrical shape.
The actual rigging on the reins on the horse
are made from the same sort of thing.
And that was done with a particle from my shirt.
And the pinhead I've made green around there
by scraping the particles off a green shirt
and then pressed onto the needle.
It's very painstaking work,
but the best things come in small packages.
I'm Jane McGonigal. I'm a game designer.
I've been making games online now for 10 years,
and my goal for the next decade
as it is to save the world in online games.
Some of you might be thinking,
"That's a lot of time to spend playing games.
actually the opposite is true.
the next century on this planet,
so I'll say it again, let it sink in:
If we want to solve problems like hunger,
poverty, climate change, global conflict, obesity,
Now, if you're not a gamer,
you might miss some of the nuance in this photo.
You probably see the sense of urgency,
a little bit of fear, but intense concentration,
deep, deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem.
you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it.
on millions of problem-solvers all over the world
as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century --
the face of someone who, against all odds,
is on the verge of an epic win.
in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems.
This is me making the "I'm Not Good At Life" face.
This is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood
And this is a problem that a lot of gamers have.
We do achieve more in game worlds.
And in real life, when we face failure,
and apply them to real-world work?
So I looked at games like World of Warcraft,
who are willing to trust you with a world-saving mission, right away.
Right? So you can do it.
and we get all this positive feedback.
I don't get that feedback in real life.
we decide to spend all our time in these game worlds.
It's just better than reality.
So, so far, collectively all the World of Warcraft gamers
have spent 5.93 million years
solving the virtual problems of Azeroth.
Now, that's not necessarily a bad thing.
But to put that in context:
5.93 million years ago
was when our earliest primate human ancestors stood up.
which is an extraordinary thing.
But it's also apt,
We're evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species.
First of all, for children in the United States,
from fifth grade to high school graduation,
if you have perfect attendance.
as they're learning about everything else in school.
so you would have heard of his theory of success,
that says if we can master 10,000 hours
We will be as good at whatever we do
as the greatest people in the world.
"What exactly are gamers getting so good at?"
Because if we could figure that out,
500 million people who are extraordinarily good at something.
we're going to have another billion gamers
who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is.
If you don't know it already, this is coming.
The game industry is developing consoles
that are low-energy and that work with the wireless phone networks
instead of broadband Internet,
so that gamers all over the world,
particularly in India, China, Brazil, can get online.
They expect one billion more gamers in the next decade.
It will bring us up to 1.5 billion gamers.
Gamers always believe that an epic win is possible,
and that it's always worth trying, and trying now.
Gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric.
There's a lot of interesting research that shows
We trust that they will spend their time with us,
that they will play by the same rules,
value the same goal, stay with the game until it's over.
actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation.
And we actually build stronger social relationships as a result.
Blissful productivity. I love it.
Second biggest wiki in the world, with nearly 80,000 articles,
is the World of Warcraft wiki.
Five million people use it every month.
than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world.
They are building an epic story.
They are building an epic knowledge resource
about the World of Warcraft.
These are people who believe that they are individually capable
of changing the world.
and not the real world.
That's the problem that I'm trying to solve.
and money in online worlds.
And he's an economist, so he's rational.
So he says, for now it makes perfect sense
But it is not, by any means, an optimal situation.
We have to start making the real world work more like a game.
2,500 years ago.
These are ancient dice, made out of sheep's knuckles.
Before we had awesome game controllers,
we had sheep's knuckles.
during a time of famine.
that the king of Lydia decided they had to do something crazy.
People were suffering. People were fighting.
So, according to Herodotus, they invented dice games,
and they set up a kingdom-wide policy:
and immerse us in such satisfying, blissful productivity,
they would ignore the fact that they had no food to eat.
And then on the next day, they would play games;
and on the next day, they would eat.
they passed 18 years this way,
surviving through a famine,
by eating on one day, and playing games on the next.
This is really exciting.
so the king decided they would play one final dice game.
They played one dice game,
and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure.
They would leave Lydia,
and they would go out in search of a new place to live,
leaving behind just enough people
And so, recently, scientists have suggested
that Herodotus' crazy story is actually true.
So this crazy story might be true.
escaping to games for 18 years,
and then been so inspired,
and knew so much about how to come together with games,
that they actually saved the entire civilization that way.
we've been playing Warcraft for 16 years.

until we solve real-world problems.
at the Institute for the Future.
We have this banner in our offices in Palo Alto,
and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future.
We want to imagine the best-case scenario outcome,
We want to imagine epic wins,
and then give people the means to achieve the epic win.
We made this game in 2007.
but we put enough online content out there
you sign up, tell us where you live,
and then we give you real-time news videos,
what's not available, how food supply is being affected,
how transportation is being affected,
if schools are closed, if there's rioting,
and you have to figure out how you would live your real life
to post videos, to post photos.
and we've tracked them for the three years since.
just because it's good for the world, or because we're supposed to.
and tell them, "We've run out of oil.
This is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on.
Challenge yourself to see how you would survive,"
most of our players have kept up the habits
that they learned in this game.
we decided to aim higher -- bigger problem than just peak oil.
And the premise was, a supercomputer has calculated
that humans have only 23 years left on the planet.
This supercomputer was called
the Global Extinction Awareness System, of course.
We asked people to come online --
almost like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie.
You know Jerry Bruckheimer movies, you form a dream team --
you've got the astronaut, the scientist, the ex-convict,
and they all have something to do to save the world.

the future of security and the future of the social safety net."

and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills.
We've got a graphic novel, we've got leveling up
in skills like local insight, knowledge networking,
sustainability, vision and resourcefulness.
I would like to invite all of you
to please share this game with young people,
anywhere in the world, particularly in developing areas,
who might benefit from coming together
but none of them have saved the real world yet.
that games are a powerful platform for change.

I'm going to talk to you today about my work on suspended animation.
Now, usually when I mention suspended animation,
people will flash me the Vulcan sign and laugh.
But now, I'm not talking about gorking people out
to fly to Mars or even Pandora,
as much fun as that may be.
I'm talking about
the concept of using suspended animation
to help people out in trauma.
when I say "suspended animation"?
It is the process by which
animals de-animate,
appear dead
and then can wake up again without being harmed.
OK, so here is the sort of big idea:
If you look out at nature,
you find that
as you tend to see suspended animation,
you tend to see immortality.
And so, what I'm going to tell you about
is a way to tell a person who's in trauma --
find a way to de-animate them a bit
so they're a little more immortal
when they have that heart attack.
that happens to be quite immortal
would be plant seeds
or bacterial spores.
These creatures are
some of the most immortal life forms on our planet,
and they tend to spend most of their time
in suspended animation.
Bacterial spores are thought now by scientists
to exist as individual cells
that are alive, but in suspended animation
for as long as 250 million years.
To suggest that this all, sort of, about little, tiny creatures,
I want to bring it close to home.
In the immortal germ line
of human beings --
that is, the eggs that sit in the ovaries --
they actually sit there in a state of suspended animation
for up to 50 years in the life of each woman.
of suspended animation.
This is Sea-Monkeys.
Those of you with children,
you know about them.
You go to the pet store or the toy store,
and you can buy these things.
You just open the bag, and you just dump them
into the plastic aquarium,
and in about a week or so, you'll have little shrimps swimming around.
Well, I wasn't so interested in the swimming.
I was interested in what was going on in the bag,
the bag on the toy store shelf
where those shrimp sat
in suspended animation indefinitely.
So these ideas of suspended animation
are not just about cells and weird, little organisms.
are briefly de-animated,
and the stories of people who are briefly de-animated
that interest me the most
are those having to do with the cold.
Ten years ago, there was a skier in Norway
that was trapped in an icy waterfall,
and she was there for two hours before they extracted her.
She was extremely cold,
and she had no heartbeat --
for all intents and purposes she was dead, frozen.
Seven hours later,
still without a heartbeat,
they brought her back to life, and she went on to be
the head radiologist
in the hospital that treated her.
so I get really excited about these things --
about a couple of years later,
there was a 13-month-old, she was from Canada.
Her father had gone out in the wintertime; he was working night shift,
and she followed him outside in nothing but a diaper.
And they found her hours later,
frozen, lifeless,
and they brought her back to life.
in Duluth, Minnesota last year
that was found frozen and without a pulse
in her front yard one morning in the winter,
and they brought her back to life.
The next day, she was doing so well, they wanted to run tests on her.
She got cranky and just went home.
(Laughter)
These are truly miraculous things that happen.
Doctors have a saying
that, in fact, "You're not dead until you're warm and dead."
And it's true. It's true.
In the New England Journal of Medicine,
there was a study published that showed
that with appropriate rewarming,
people who had suffered without a heartbeat for three hours
could be brought back to life without any neurologic problems.
That's over 50 percent.
So what I was trying to do is think of a way
that we could study
suspended animation
to think about a way
to reproduce, maybe,
what happened to the skier.
and that is that being exposed to low oxygen
does not always kill.
So, in this room, there's 20 percent oxygen or so,
and if we reduce the oxygen concentration,
we will all be dead.
And, in fact, the animals we were working with in the lab --
these little garden worms, nematodes --
they were also dead when we exposed them to low oxygen.
And here's the thing that should freak you out.
And that is that, when we lower the oxygen concentration further
by 100 times, to 10 parts per million,
they were not dead,
they were in suspended animation,
and we could bring them back to life without any harm.
And this precise oxygen concentration,
10 parts per million,
that caused suspended animation,
is conserved.
We can see it in a variety of different organisms.
One of the creatures we see it in
is a fish.
And we can turn its heartbeat on and off by going in and out
of suspended animation like you would a light switch.
that we could do this.
And so I was wondering, when we were trying
to reproduce the work with the skier,
that we noticed that, of course,
she had no oxygen consumption,
and so maybe she was in a similar state of suspended animation.
But, of course, she was also extremely cold.
So we wondered what would happen
if we took our suspended animals and exposed them to the cold.
And so, what we found out
was that, if you take animals
that are animated like you and I,
and you make them cold -- that is, these were the garden worms --
now they're dead.
But if you have them in suspended animation,
and move them into the cold, they're all alive.
And there's the very important thing there:
If you want to survive the cold,
you ought to be suspended. Right?
It's a really good thing.
about this relationship between these things,
and thinking about whether or not that's what happened to the skier.
And so we wondered: Might there be some agent
that is in us, something that we make ourselves,
that we might be able to regulate our own metabolic flexibility
in such a way as to be able to survive
when we got extremely cold, and might otherwise pass away?
I thought it might be interesting to sort of hunt for such things.
You know?
that physiology textbooks that you can read about
will tell you that this is a kind of heretical thing to suggest.
We have, from the time we are slapped on the butt
until we take our last dying breath --
that's when we're newborn to when we're dead --
we cannot reduce our metabolic rate
below what's called a standard,
or basal metabolic rate.
But I knew that there were examples
of creatures, also mammals,
that do reduce their metabolic rate
such as ground squirrels and bears,
they reduce their metabolic rate
in the wintertime when they hibernate.
So I wondered: Might we be able to find some agent or trigger
that might induce such a state in us?
And this was a period of time when we failed tremendously.
Ken Robinson is here. He talked about the glories of failure.
Well, we had a lot of them.
We tried many different chemicals and agents,
and we failed over and over again.
So, one time, I was at home
watching television on the couch
while my wife was putting our child to bed,
and I was watching a television show.
It was a television show --
it was a NOVA show on PBS --
about caves in New Mexico.
And this particular cave was Lechuguilla,
and this cave is incredibly toxic to humans.
The researchers had to suit up just to enter it.
It's filled with this toxic gas,
hydrogen sulfide.
Now, hydrogen sulfide is curiously present in us.
We make it ourselves.
The highest concentration is in our brains.
Yet, it was used
as a chemical warfare agent in World War I.
It's an extraordinarily toxic thing.
In fact, in chemical accidents,
hydrogen sulfide is known to --
if you breathe too much of it, you collapse to the ground,
you appear dead,
but if you were brought out into room air, you can be reanimated without harm,
if they do that quickly.
(Laughter)
Now, it's post-9/11 America,
and when you go into the research institute,
and you say, "Hi.
I'd like to buy some concentrated,
compressed gas cylinders
of a lethal gas
because I have these ideas, see,
about wanting to suspend people.
It's really going to be OK."
So that's kind of a tough day,
but I said, "There really is
some basis for thinking why you might want to do this."
As I said, this agent is in us,
and, in fact, here's a curious thing,
it binds to the very place inside of your cells
where oxygen binds, and where you burn it,
and that you do this burning to live.
And so we thought, like in a game of musical chairs,
might we be able to give a person
some hydrogen sulfide,
and might it be able to occupy that place
like in a game of musical chairs where oxygen might bind?
And because you can't bind the oxygen,
maybe you wouldn't consume it,
and then maybe it would reduce your demand for oxygen.
I mean, who knows?
So, there's the bit about the dopamine
and being a little bit, what do you call it, delusional,
and you might suggest that was it.
And so, we wanted to find out
might we be able to use
hydrogen sulfide in the presence of cold,
and we wanted to see whether we could
reproduce this skier in a mammal.
Now, mammals are warm-blooded creatures,
and when we get cold, we shake and we shiver, right?
We try to keep our core temperature at 37 degrees
by actually burning more oxygen.
So, it was interesting for us
when we applied hydrogen sulfide
to a mouse when it was also cold
because what happened is the core temperature
of the mouse got cold.
It stopped moving.
It appeared dead.
Its oxygen consumption rate
fell by tenfold.
And here's the really important point.
I told you hydrogen sulfide is in us.
It's rapidly metabolized,
and all you have to do after six hours of being
in this state of de-animation
is simply put the thing out in room air,
and it warms up, and it's none the worse for wear.
Really. Because we had found a way
to de-animate a mammal,
and it didn't hurt it.
Now, we'd found a way to reduce
its oxygen consumption
to rock-bottom levels, and it was fine.
Now, in this state of de-animation,
it could not go out dancing,
but it was not dead,
and it was not harmed.
So we started to think: Is this the agent
that might have been present in the skier,
and might have she had more of it than someone else,
and might that have been able to reduce
her demand for oxygen
before she got so cold that
she otherwise would have died,
as we found out with our worm experiments?
Can we do anything useful
with this capacity to
control metabolic flexibility?
And one of the things we wondered --
I'm sure some of you out there are economists,
and you know all about supply and demand.
And when supply is equal to demand,
everything's fine,
but when supply falls,
in this case of oxygen,
and demand stays high, you're dead.
So, what I just told you
is we can now reduce demand.
We ought to be able to lower supply
to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal.
And with money we got from DARPA,
we could show just that.
If you give mice hydrogen sulfide,
you can lower their demand for oxygen,
and you can put them into oxygen concentrations
that are as low as 5,000 feet above the top of Mt. Everest,
and they can sit there for hours, and there's no problem.
Well this was really cool.
We also found out that we could subject animals
to otherwise lethal blood loss, and we could save them
if we gave them hydrogen sulfide.
led me to say "I should found a company,
and we should take this out to a wider playing field."
I founded a company called Ikaria
with others' help.
And this company, the first thing it did
was make a liquid formulation of hydrogen sulfide
an injectable form that we could put in
and send it out to physician scientists all over the world
who work on models of critical care medicine,
and the results are incredibly positive.
animals given hydrogen sulfide
showed a 70 percent reduction in heart damage
compared to those who got the standard of care that
you and I would receive if we were to have a heart attack here today.
Same is true for organ failure,
when you have loss of function owing to poor perfusion of kidney, of liver,
acute respiratory distress syndrome
and damage suffered in cardiac-bypass surgery.
So, these are the thought leaders in trauma medicine
all over the world saying this is true,
so it seems that exposure to hydrogen sulfide
decreases damage that you receive
from being exposed to otherwise lethal-low oxygen.
required to get this benefit
are low, incredibly low.
In fact, so low that physicians will not have to lower or dim
the metabolism of people much at all
to see the benefit I just mentioned,
which is a wonderful thing, if you're thinking about adopting this.
You don't want to be gorking people out
just to save them, it's really confusing.
(Laughter)
Now, and so --
(Applause)
Thank you. The Phase 1 safety studies are over,
and we're doing fine, we're now moved on.
We have to get to Phase 2 and Phase 3. It's going to take us a few years.
This has all moved very quickly,
and the mouse experiments
of hibernating mice happened in 2005;
the first human studies were done in 2008,
and we should know in a couple of years
whether it works or not.
And this all happened really quickly
because of a lot of help from a lot of people.
my wife, without whom this talk and my work would not be possible,
so thank you very much.
Also, the brilliant scientists who work at my lab
and also others on staff,
the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, Washington --
wonderful place to work.
And also the wonderful scientists
and businesspeople at Ikaria.
One thing those people did out there
was take this technology of hydrogen sulfide,
which is this start-up company that's burning venture capital very quickly,
and they fused it with another company
that sells another toxic gas
that's more toxic than hydrogen sulfide,
and they give it to newborn babies who would otherwise die
from a failure to be able to oxygenate their tissues properly.
And this gas that is delivered in over
a thousand critical care hospitals worldwide,
now is approved, on label,
and saves thousands of babies a year
from certain death.
(Applause)
for me to be a part of this.
And I want to say that I think we're on the path
of understanding metabolic flexibility
in a fundamental way,
and that in the not too distant future,
an EMT might give an injection of hydrogen sulfide,
or some related compound,
to a person suffering severe injuries,
and that person might de-animate a bit,
they might become a little more immortal.
Their metabolism will fall
as though you were dimming a switch on a lamp at home.
And then, they will have the time, that will buy them the time,
to be transported to the hospital
to get the care they need.
And then, after they get that care --
like the mouse, like the skier,
like the 65-year-old woman --
they'll wake up.
A miracle?
We hope not, or maybe we just hope
to make miracles a little more common.
(Applause)
For some time I have been interested in
the placebo effect,
which might seem like an odd thing
for a magician to be interested in,
unless you think of it in the terms that I do,
which is, "Something fake
is believed in enough by somebody
that it becomes something real."
In other words, sugar pills
have a measurable effect in certain kinds of studies,
the placebo effect,
just because the person thinks
that what's happening to them is a pharmaceutical
or some sort of a --
for pain management, for example,
if they believe it enough there is a measurable effect in the body
called the placebo effect.
Something fake becomes
something real
because of someone's perception of it.
I want to start by showing you a rudimentary,
very simple magic trick.
And I'm going to show you how it works. This is a trick
that's been in every children's magic book since at least the 1950s.
I learned it myself from Cub Scout Magic in the 1970s.
I'll do it for you, and then I'll explain it.
And then I'll explain why I explained it.
The knife, which you can examine; my hand, which you could examine.
I'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this.
I'll get my sleeve back.
And to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve
I'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here.
That way you can see that at no time
can anything travel, as long as I'm squeezing there
nothing can go up or down my sleeve.
And the object of this is quite simple.
I'm going to open my hand,
and hopefully, if all is well,
my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife.
In fact it's held so tightly in place
that I can shake it,
and the knife does not come off.
Nothing goes up or down my sleeve,
no trickery. And you can examine everything.
Ta-da!
(Applause)
that are interested in magic, because you can learn
a great deal about deception by studying
this very -- even though it's a very simple trick methodologically.
Probably many of you in the room know this trick.
What happens is this.
I hold the knife in my hand.
I say I'm going to grab hold of my wrist
to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve,
that is a lie.
is because that's actually the secret
of the illusion.
In a moment when my hand moves from facing you
to being away from you,
this finger right here, my index finger is just going to shift
from where it is, to a position
pointing out like this.
Nice one.
Someone who didn't have a childhood is out there.
(Laughter)
And as I move around my finger shifts.
And we could talk about why this is deceptive,
why you don't notice there are only three fingers down here,
because the mind, and the way it processes information,
it doesn't count, one, two, three. It groups them.
But that's not really what this is about. Right? And then I open my hand up.
Obviously it's clinging there, not by animal magnetism,
but by chicanery,
my index finger being there.
And then when I close my finger, same thing,
as I move back, this motion
kind of covers the moving back of my finger.
I take this hand away. You give the knife out.
There is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors. Thanks.
what does that have to do with the placebo effect?
I read a study a year or so ago
that really blew my mind wide open.
I'm not a doctor or a researcher, so this, to me,
was an astonishing thing.
It turns out that if you administer
a placebo in the form of a white pill,
that's like aspirin shaped --
it's just a round white pill -- it has some certain measurable effect.
But if you change the form that you give the placebo in,
like you make a smaller pill,
and color it blue, and stamp a letter into it,
it is actually measurably more effective.
Even though neither one of these things
has any pharmaceutical -- they're sugar pills.
But a white pill is not as good as a blue pill.
What? (Laughter) That really flipped me out.
If you have capsules,
they're more effective than tablets in any form.
A colored capsule, that's yellow on one end and red on the other
is better than a white capsule.
Dosage has something to do with this.
One pill twice a day
is not as good at three pills --
I don't remember the statistic now. Sorry.
But the point is ...
(Laughter) ... these dosages have something to do with it.
And the form has something to do with it.
And if you want the ultimate in placebo,
you've go to the needle.
Right? A syringe with some inert --
a couple CCs of some inert something,
and you inject this into a patient ...
Well this is such a powerful image in their mind,
it's so much stronger than the white pill.
some other time when we have slides.
The point is
the white pill is not as good as the blue pill
is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle.
And none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality,
it's only your belief that makes it real
in your body and makes a stronger effect.
I wanted to see if I could take that idea
and apply it to a magic trick.
And take something that is obviously a fake trick
and make it seem real.
And we know from that study
that when you want reality, you go to the needle.
and I'm going to just sterilize it a tiny bit.
This is really my flesh. This is not
Damian's special-grown flesh.
That's my skin right there. This is not a Hollywood special effect.
I'm going to pierce my skin
and run this needle through to the other side.
if you faint easily -- I was doing this for some friends
in the hotel room last night, and some people that I didn't know,
and one woman almost passed out.
So, I suggest if you get queasy easy
that you look away for about the next 30 --
in fact, you know what, I'll do the first bad part behind it.
You'll get to see, you can look away too if you'd like to.
the beginning of my flesh
at the lower part of my arm I just make
a little pierce.
I'm sorry, man. Am I freaking you out?
OK, and then just through my skin a tiny bit,
and then out the other side like this.
Now, essentially we're in the same position we were in
with the knife trick.
(Laughter)
Sort of.
But you can't count my fingers right now can you?
So, let me show them to you. That's one, two
three, four, five.
Yes, well...
They go, "Well, he's certainly not dumb enough
to stab himself through the skin to entertain us for a few minutes.
So, let me give you a little peek.
How's that look out there? Pretty good.
(Laughs)
Yeah, I know. (Laughs)
And the people in the back go, "OK, I didn't really see that."
People in the satellite room are starting to move in now.
Let me give you good close look at this.
That really is my skin. That is not a Hollywood special effect.
That's my flesh, and I can twist that around.
I'm sorry. If you're getting queasy, look away,
don't look at the thing.
will go, "Well yeah, that looks kind of neat
in some sort of effect there, but if it were real he would be --
see there's a hole there and a hole there, if it were real he would be bleeding.
Well let me work up some blood for you.
(Laughter)
Yes, there it is.
(Applause)
(Laughter)
I would clean off my arm, and I would show you that there are no wounds.
But I think in this context
and with the idea of taking something fake
and making it into something real,
I'm just going to leave it there,
and walk off the stage.
(Laughter)
I will be seeing you several times over the next few days.
I hope you're looking forward to that. Thank you very much.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
OK. We've heard a lot of people
speak at this conference
about the power of the human mind.
And what I'd like to do today
is give you a vivid example
when someone is in a survival situation,
how the will to survive can bring that out in people.
This is an incident which occurred on Mount Everest;
it was the worst disaster in the history of Everest.
And when it occurred, I was the only doctor on the mountain.
So I'll take you through that
and we'll see what it's like
when someone really
summons the will to survive.
It's 29,035 feet high.
making tectonic plate measurements;
twice, I went with NASA
doing remote sensing devices.
It was on my fourth trip to Everest
that a comet passed over the mountain. Hyakutake.
And the Sherpas told us then
that was a very bad omen,
and we should have listened to them.
Everest is an extreme environment.
There's only one-third as much oxygen at the summit as there is at sea level.
Near the summit, temperatures
can be 40 degrees below zero.
You can have winds 20 to 40 miles an hour.
It's actually a wind-chill factor
which is lower than a summer day on Mars.
I remember one time being up near the summit,
I reached into my down jacket
for a drink from my water bottle,
inside my down jacket,
only to discover that the water was already frozen solid.
That gives you an idea of just how severe
things are near the summit.
It starts at base camp, at 17,500 feet.
Camp One, 2,000 feet higher.
Camp Two, another 2,000 feet higher up,
what's called the Western Cwm.
CampThree is at the base of Lhotse,
which is the fourth highest mountain in the world, but it's dwarfed by Everest.
And then Camp Four is the highest camp;
that's 3,000 feet short of the summit.
This is a view of base camp.
This is pitched on a glacier at 17,500 feet.
It's the highest point you can bring your yaks
before you have to unload.
And this is what they unloaded for me:
I had four yak loads of medical supplies,
which are dumped in a tent,
and here I am trying to arrange things.
It was a National Geographic expedition,
but it was organized by The Explorers Club.
There were three other expeditions on the mountain,
an American team, a New Zealand team
and an IMAX team.
And, after actually two months of preparation,
we built our camps all the way up the mountain.
the first 2,000 feet of the climb
up from base camp.
And here's a picture in the icefall;
it's a waterfall, but it's frozen, but it moves very slowly,
and it actually changes every day.
When you're in it, you're like a rat in a maze;
you can't even see over the top.
This is near the top of the icefall.
You want to climb through at night when the ice is frozen.
That way, it's less likely to tumble down on you.
These are some climbers reaching the top of the icefall just at sun-up.
This is me crossing a crevasse.
We cross on aluminum ladders with safety ropes attached.
That's another crevasse.
Some of these things are 10 stories deep or more,
and one of my climbing friends says that
the reason we actually climb at night
is because if we ever saw the bottom
of what we're climbing over,
we would never do it.
It's the first flat spot you can reach
after you get up to the top of the icefall.
And from there we climb up to Camp Two,
which is sort of the foreground.
These are climbers moving up the Lhotse face,
that mountain toward Camp Three.
They're on fixed ropes here.
A fall here, if you weren't roped in,
would be 5,000 feet down.
This is a view taken from camp three.
You can see the Lhotse face is in profile,
it's about a 45 degree angle. It takes two days to climb it,
so you put the camp halfway through.
There's no ice over it.
And that's because Everest is so high,
it's in the jet stream,
and winds are constantly scouring the face,
so no snow gets to accumulate.
What looks like a cloud behind the summit ridge
is actually snow being blown off the summit.
moving in, up through the clouds.
And this is at Camp Four.
Once you get to Camp Four, you have maybe 24 hours
to decide if you're going to go for the summit or not.
Everybody's on oxygen, your supplies are limited,
and you either have to go up or go down,
make that decision very quickly.
This is a picture of Rob Hall.
He was the leader of the New Zealand team.
This is a radio he used later to call his wife
that I'll tell you about.
These are some climbers waiting to go to the summit.
They're up at Camp Four, and you can see that there's wind blowing off the summit.
This is not good weather to climb in,
so the climbers are just waiting, hoping that the wind's going to die down.
And, in fact, the wind does die down at night.
It becomes very calm, there's no wind at all.
This looks like a good chance to go for the summit.
So here are some climbers starting out for the summit
on what's called the Triangular Face.
It's the first part of climb.
It's done in the dark, because it's actually less steep than what comes next,
and you can gain daylight hours if you do this in the dark.
The climbers got on the southeast ridge.
This is the view looking at the southeast ridge.
The summit would be in the foreground.
From here, it's about 1,500 feet
up at a 30-degree angle to the summit.
But what happened that year was
the wind suddenly and unexpectedly picked up.
A storm blew in that no one was anticipating.
You can see here some ferocious winds
blowing snow way high off the summit.
And there were climbers on that summit ridge.
taken a year before,
and you can see I've got an oxygen mask on
with a rebreather.
I have an oxygen hose connected here.
You can see on this climber, we have two oxygen tanks in the backpack --
little titanium tanks, very lightweight --
and we're not carrying much else.
This is all you've got. You're very exposed on the summit ridge.
This is on the way toward the summit,
on that 1,500-foot bridge.
All the climbers here are climbing unroped,
and the reason is because
the drop off is so sheer on either side
that if you were roped to somebody,
you'd wind up just pulling them off with you.
So each person climbs individually.
And it's not a straight path at all,
it's very difficult climbing,
and there's always the risk
of falling on either side.
If you fall to your left, you're going to fall
8,000 feet into Nepal;
if you fall to your right,
you're going to fall 12,000 feet into Tibet.
So it's probably better to fall into Tibet
because you'll live longer.
(Laughter)
But, either way, you fall for the rest of your life.
along that summit ridge that you see up there,
and I was down here in Camp Three.
My expedition was down in Camp Three,
while these guys were up there in the storm.
The storm was so fierce that we had to lay,
fully dressed, fully equipped,
laid out on the tent floor
to stop the tent from blowing off the mountain.
It was the worst winds I've ever seen.
And the climbers up on the ridge
were that much higher, 2,000 feet higher,
and completely exposed to the elements.
We were in radio contact with some of them.
Rob Hall, we heard by radio,
was up here, at this point in the storm
with Doug Hansen.
And we heard that Rob was OK,
but Doug was too weak to come down.
He was exhausted, and Rob was staying with him.
We also got some bad news in the storm
that Beck Weathers, another climber,
had collapsed in the snow and was dead.
There were still 18 other climbers
that we weren't aware of their condition.
They were lost. There was total confusion on the mountain;
all the stories were confusing, most of them were conflicting.
We really had no idea what was going on during that storm.
We were just hunkered down
in our tents at Camp Three.
decided to go up to try to rescue who they could
even though there was a ferocious storm going.
They tried to radio a message to Rob Hall,
who was a superb climber
stuck, sort of, with a weak climber
up near the summit.
I expected them to say to Rob,
"Hold on. We're coming."
But in fact, what they said was,
"Leave Doug and come down yourself.
There's no chance of saving him,
and just try to save yourself at this point."
And Rob got that message,
but his answer was,
"We're both listening."
Todd and Pete got up to the summit ridge, up in here,
and it was a scene of complete chaos up there.
But they did what they could to stabilize the people.
I gave them radio advice from Camp Three,
and we sent down the climbers that could make it down
under their own power.
The ones that couldn't we just sort of decided to leave up at Camp Four.
So the climbers were coming down along this route.
And they all came by me
so I could take a look at them and see what I could do for them,
which is really not much, because Camp Three
is a little notch cut in the ice
in the middle of a 45-degree angle.
You can barely stand outside the tent.
It's really cold; it's 24,000 feet.
The only supplies I had at that altitude
were two plastic bags
with preloaded syringes
of painkiller and steroids.
I sort of assessed whether or not they were in condition
to continue on further down.
The ones that weren't that lucid or were not that well coordinated,
I would give an injection of steroids
to try to give them some period
of lucidity and coordination
where they could then work their way further down the mountain.
It's so awkward to work up there that sometimes
I even gave the injections right through their clothes.
It was just too hard to maneuver
any other way up there.
we got more news about Rob Hall.
There was no way we could get up high enough to rescue him.
He called in to say that he was alone now.
Apparently, Doug had died higher up on the mountain.
But Rob was now too weak to come down himself,
and with the fierce winds and up at that altitude,
he was just beyond rescue
and he knew it.
At that point, he asked
to be paged into his wife.
He was carrying a radio.
His wife was home in New Zealand,
seven months pregnant with their first child,
and Rob asked to be patched into her. That was done,
and Rob and his wife
had their last conversation.
They picked the name for their baby.
Rob then signed off,
and that was the last we ever heard of him.
at 24,000 feet,
which was an impossibility.
So what we did was, we got the victims
down to 21,000 feet, where it was easier for me to treat them.
This was my medical kit.
It's a tackle box filled with medical supplies.
This is what I carried up the mountain.
I had more supplies lower down,
which I asked to be brought up to meet me at the lower camp.
And this was scene at the lower camp.
Some of them were hypothermic,
some of them were frostbitten, some were both.
What we did was try to warm them up as best we could,
put oxygen on them and try to revive them,
which is difficult to do at 21,000 feet,
when the tent is freezing.
This is some severe frostbite on the feet,
severe frostbite on the nose.
This climber was snow blind.
we got a startling experience.
Out of nowhere, Beck Weathers,
who we had already been told was dead,
stumbled into the tent,
just like a mummy, he walked into the tent.
I expected him to be incoherent,
but, in fact, he walked into the tent and said to me,
"Hi, Ken. Where should I sit?"
And then he said,
"Do you accept my health insurance?"
(Laughter)
He really said that.
(Laughter)
So he was completely lucid, but he was very severely frostbitten.
You can see his hand is completely white;
his face, his nose, is burned.
First, it turns white, and then when it's completed necrosis,
it turns black, and then it falls off.
It's the last stage, just like a scar.
he related what had been going on up there.
He said he had gotten lost in the storm,
collapsed in the snow,
and just laid there, unable to move.
Some climbers had come by and looked at him,
and he heard them say, "He's dead."
But Beck wasn't dead; he heard that,
but he was completely unable to move.
He was in some sort of catatonic state
where he could be aware of his surroundings,
but couldn't even blink to indicate that he was alive.
So the climbers passed him by,
and Beck lay there for a day, a night
and another day,
in the snow.
And then he said to himself,
"I don't want to die.
I have a family to come back to."
And the thoughts of his family,
his kids and his wife,
generated enough energy,
enough motivation in him,
so that he actually got up.
After laying in the snow that long a time,
he got up and found his way back to the camp.
And Beck told me that story very quietly,
but I was absolutely stunned by it.
I couldn't imagine anybody laying in the snow
that long a time
and then getting up.
He apparently reversed
an irreversible hypothermia.
And I can only try to speculate
on how he did it.
hooked up to a SPECT scan,
something that could actually measure brain function?
Just very simply, the three parts of the brain:
the frontal lobe, where you focus
your attention and concentration;
you have the temporal lobe,
where you form images and keep memories;
and the posterior part of your brain,
which contains the cerebellum, which controls motion;
and the brain stem,
where you have your basic maintenance functions,
like heartbeat and respiration.
and imagine that Beck
was hooked up to a SPECT scan.
This measures dynamic blood flow
and therefore energy flow within the brain.
So you have the prefrontal cortex here,
lighting up in red.
This is a pretty evenly distributed scan.
You have the middle area,
where the temporal lobe might be, in here,
and the posterior portion, where the maintenance functions are in the back.
showing equal distribution of energy.
Now, you go to this one and you see how much more
the frontal lobes are lighting up.
This might be what Beck would be experiencing
when he realizes he's in danger.
He's focusing all his attention
on getting himself out of trouble.
These parts of the brain are quieting down.
He's not thinking about his family or anybody else at this point,
and he's working pretty hard.
He's trying to get his muscles going and get out of this.
OK, but he's losing ground here.
He's running out of energy.
It's too cold; he can't keep his metabolic fires going,
and, you see, there's no more red here;
his brain is quieting down.
He's collapsed in the snow here. Everything is quiet,
there's very little red anywhere.
Beck is powering down.
He's dying.
but, in Beck's case,
you can see that the middle part of his brain
is beginning to light up again.
He's beginning to think about his family.
He's beginning to have images
that are motivating him to get up.
He's developing energy in this area
through thought.
And this is how he's going to turn thought
back into action.
This part of the brain is called the anterior cingulate gyrus.
It's an area in which
a lot of neuroscientists believe
the seat of will exists.
This is where people make decisions, where they develop willpower.
And, you can see, there's an energy flow
going from the mid portion of his brain,
where he's got images of his family,
into this area, which is powering his will.
to the point where it's actually
going to be a motivating factor.
He's going to develop enough energy in that area --
after a day, a night and a day --
to actually motivate himself to get up.
And you can see here,
he's starting to get more energy into the frontal lobe.
He's beginning to focus, he can concentrate now.
He's thinking about what he's got to do to save himself.
So this energy has been transmitted
up toward the front of his brain,
and it's getting quieter down here,
but he's using this energy
to think about what he has to do to get himself going.
And then, that energy is sort of spreading
throughout his thought areas.
He's not thinking about his family now, and he's getting himself motivated.
This is the posterior part, where his muscles are going to be moving,
and he's going to be pacing himself.
His heart and lungs are going to pick up speed.
So this is what I can speculate might have been going on
had we been able to do a SPECT scan on Beck
during this survival epic.
and I felt what I was doing was completely trivial
compared to what he had done for himself.
It just shows you what the power of the mind can do.
He was critically ill, there were other critically ill patients;
luckily, we were able to get a helicopter
in to rescue these guys.
A helicopter came in at 21,000 feet
and carried out the highest helicopter rescue in history.
It was able to land on the ice, take away Beck
and the other survivors, one by one,
and get them off to Kathmandu in a clinic
before we even got back to base camp.
at one of the camps
where some of the climbers were lost.
And we had a memorial service there
a few days later.
These are Serphas lighting juniper branches.
They believe juniper smoke is holy.
And the climbers stood around on the high rocks
and spoke of the climbers who were lost
up near the summit,
turning to the mountain, actually, to talk to them directly.
There were five climbers lost here.
This was Scott Fischer,
Rob Hall,
Andy Harris,
Doug Hansen
and Yasuko Namba.
And one more climber
should have died that day, but didn't,
and that's Beck Weathers.
He was able to survive
because he was able to generate that incredible willpower,
he was able to use all the power of his mind
to save himself.
These Sherpas believe that
if you write prayers on these flags,
the message will be carried up to the gods,
and that year, Beck's message was answered.
(Applause)
So, I've known a lot of fish in my life.
I've loved only two.
That first one,
it was more like a passionate affair.
It was a beautiful fish:
flavorful, textured, meaty,
a bestseller on the menu.
What a fish.
(Laughter)
Even better,
it was farm-raised to the supposed highest standards
of sustainability.
So you could feel good about selling it.
for several months.
One day, the head of the company called
and asked if I'd speak at an event
about the farm's sustainability.
"Absolutely," I said.
Here was a company trying to solve
what's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs:
How do we keep fish on our menus?
we've been fishing the seas
like we clear-cut forests.
It's hard to overstate the destruction.
Ninety percent of large fish, the ones we love --
the tunas, the halibuts, the salmons, swordfish --
they've collapsed.
There's almost nothing left.
So, for better or for worse,
aquaculture, fish farming, is going to be a part of our future.
A lot of arguments against it:
Fish farms pollute -- most of them do anyway --
and they're inefficient. Take tuna,
a major drawback.
It's got a feed conversion ratio
of 15 to one.
That means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish
to get you one pound of farm tuna.
Not very sustainable.
It doesn't taste very good either.
was a company trying to do it right.
I wanted to support them.
The day before the event,
I called the head of P.R. for the company.
Let's call him Don.
for farming so far out to sea, you don't pollute."
the waste from our fish gets distributed,
not concentrated."
And then he added,
"We're basically a world unto ourselves.
That feed conversion ratio? 2.5 to one," he said.
"Best in the business."
"2.5 what? What are you feeding?"
And that night, I was lying in bed, and I thought:
What the hell is a sustainable protein?
(Laughter)
I said, "Don, what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
Well, I got on the phone with a few people in the company;
no one could give me a straight answer
until finally, I got on the phone
with the head biologist.
Let's call him Don too.
(Laughter)
"what are some examples of sustainable proteins?"
and some fish meals,
and then he said chicken pellets.
I said, "Chicken pellets?"
bone meal, scraps,
dried and processed into feed."
of your feed is chicken?"
Thinking, you know, two percent.
about feeding chicken to fish?"
(Laughter)
and he said, "There's just too much chicken in the world."
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
No, not because I'm some self-righteous,
goody-two shoes foodie.
I actually am.
(Laughter)
No, I actually fell out of love with this fish because, I swear to God,
after that conversation, the fish tasted like chicken.
(Laughter)
it's a different kind of love story.
It's the romantic kind,
the kind where the more you get to know your fish,
you love the fish.
I first ate it at a restaurant
in southern Spain.
A journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time.
She kind of set us up.
(Laughter)
It came to the table
a bright, almost shimmering, white color.
The chef had overcooked it.
Like twice over.
Amazingly, it was still delicious.
after it's been overcooked?
I can't,
but this guy can.
Let's call him Miguel --
actually his name is Miguel.
(Laughter)
And no, he didn't cook the fish, and he's not a chef,
at least in the way that you and I understand it.
He's a biologist
at Veta La Palma.
It's a fish farm in the southwestern corner of Spain.
It's at the tip of the Guadalquivir river.
the farm was in the hands of the Argentinians.
They raised beef cattle
on what was essentially wetlands.
They did it by draining the land.
They built this intricate series of canals,
and they pushed water off the land and out into the river.
Well, they couldn't make it work,
not economically.
And ecologically, it was a disaster.
It killed like 90 percent of the birds,
which, for this place, is a lot of birds.
And so in 1982,
a Spanish company with an environmental conscience
purchased the land.
They reversed the flow of water.
They literally flipped the switch.
Instead of pushing water out,
they used the channels to pull water back in.
They flooded the canals.
They created a 27,000-acre fish farm --
bass, mullet,
shrimp, eel --
and in the process, Miguel and this company
completely reversed the ecological destruction.
The farm's incredible.
I mean, you've never seen anything like this.
You stare out at a horizon
that is a million miles away,
and all you see are flooded canals
and this thick, rich marshland.
He's an amazing guy,
like three parts Charles Darwin and one part Crocodile Dundee.
(Laughter)
Okay? There we are slogging through the wetlands,
and I'm panting and sweating, got mud up to my knees,
and Miguel's calmly conducting a biology lecture.
Here, he's pointing out a rare Black-shouldered Kite.
Now, he's mentioning the mineral needs of phytoplankton.
And here, here he sees a grouping pattern
that reminds him of the Tanzanian Giraffe.
in the Mikumi National Park in Africa.
I asked him how he became
such an expert on fish.
I'm an expert in relationships."
And then he's off, launching into more talk
about rare birds and algaes
and strange aquatic plants.
the biotic community unplugged, kind of thing.
It's great, but I was in love.
And my head was swooning over that
overcooked piece of delicious fish I had the night before.
So I interrupted him. I said,
"Miguel, what makes your fish taste so good?"
the relationships: It's amazing.
But what are your fish eating?
What's the feed conversion ratio?"
it's such a rich system
that the fish are eating what they'd be eating in the wild.
The plant biomass, the phytoplankton,
the zooplankton, it's what feeds the fish.
The system is so healthy,
it's totally self-renewing.
There is no feed.
Ever heard of a farm that doesn't feed its animals?
and I asked him, I said, "For a place that seems so natural,
unlike like any farm I'd ever been at,
how do you measure success?"
a film director called for a set change.
And we rounded the corner
and saw the most amazing sight:
thousands and thousands of pink flamingos,
a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see.
"Look at their bellies, pink.
They're feasting."
Feasting? I was totally confused.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
"We lose 20 percent of our fish
and fish eggs to birds.
Well, last year, this property
had 600,000 birds on it,
more than 250 different species.
It's become, today, the largest
and one of the most important
private bird sanctuaries in all of Europe."
like the last thing you want on a fish farm?"
(Laughter)
He shook his head, no.
not intensively.
This is an ecological network.
The flamingos eat the shrimp.
The shrimp eat the phytoplankton.
So the pinker the belly,
the better the system."
a farm that doesn't feed its animals,
and a farm that measures its success
on the health of its predators.
A fish farm, but also a bird sanctuary.
Oh, and by the way, those flamingos,
they shouldn't even be there in the first place.
They brood in a town
150 miles away,
where the soil conditions
are better for building nests.
Every morning, they fly
150 miles into the farm.
And every evening, they fly 150 miles back.
(Laughter)
They do that because they're able to follow
the broken white line
of highway A92.
(Laughter)
No kidding.
so I looked at Miguel.
I said, "Miguel, do they fly
150 miles to the farm,
and then do they fly
150 miles back at night?
Do they do that for the children?"
(Laughter)
He said, "No; they do it because the food's better."
(Laughter)
which was delicious -- and I don't like fish skin;
I don't like it seared, I don't like it crispy.
It's that acrid, tar-like flavor.
I almost never cook with it.
Yet, when I tasted it at that restaurant in southern Spain,
it tasted not at all like fish skin.
It tasted sweet and clean,
like you were taking a bite of the ocean.
I mentioned that to Miguel, and he nodded.
He said, "The skin acts like a sponge.
It's the last defense before anything enters the body.
It evolved to soak up impurities."
And then he added,
"But our water has no impurities."
a farm that measures its success
by the success of its predators.
And then I realized when he says,
"A farm that has no impurities,"
he made a big understatement,
because the water that flows through that farm
comes in from the Guadalquivir River.
It's a river that carries with it
all the things that rivers tend to carry these days:
chemical contaminants,
pesticide runoff.
And when it works its way through the system
and leaves,
the water is cleaner than when it entered.
The system is so healthy, it purifies the water.
So, not just a farm that doesn't feed its animals,
not just a farm that measures its success
by the health of its predators,
but a farm that's literally a water purification plant --
and not just for those fish,
but for you and me as well.
Because when that water leaves, it dumps out into the Atlantic.
A drop in the ocean, I know,
but I'll take it, and so should you,
because this love story,
however romantic,
is also instructive.
You might say it's a recipe
for the future of good food,
whether we're talking about bass or beef cattle.
a radically new conception of agriculture,
one in which the food actually tastes good.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But for a lot people,
that's a bit too radical.
We're not realists, us foodies;
we're lovers.
We love farmers' markets,
we love small family farms,
we talk about local food,
we eat organic.
And when you suggest these are the things
that will ensure the future of good food,
someone, somewhere stands up and says,
"Hey guy, I love pink flamingos,
but how are you going to feed the world?"
How are you going to feed the world?
I don't love that question.
No, not because we already produce
enough calories to more than feed the world.
One billion people will go hungry today.
One billion -- that's more than ever before --
because of gross inequalities in distribution,
not tonnage.
Now, I don't love this question because it's determined the logic
of our food system for the last 50 years.
pesticides to monocultures, chemicals to soil,
chicken to fish,
and all along agribusiness
has simply asked,
"If we're feeding more people more cheaply,
how terrible could that be?"
That's been the motivation,
it's been the justification:
it's been the business plan
of American agriculture.
We should call it what it is:
a business in liquidation,
a business that's quickly eroding
ecological capital that makes that very production possible.
That's not a business,
and it isn't agriculture.
not because of diminishing supply,
but because of diminishing resources.
Not by the latest combine and tractor invention,
but by fertile land;
not by pumps, but by fresh water;
not by chainsaws, but by forests;
and not by fishing boats and nets, but by fish in the sea.
Let's start by asking: How are we going to feed ourselves?
Or better: How can we create conditions
that enable every community
to feed itself?
(Applause)
To do that,
don't look at the agribusiness model for the future.
It's really old, and it's tired.
It's high on capital, chemistry and machines,
and it's never produced anything really good to eat.
Instead, let's look to the ecological model.
That's the one that relies on two billion years
of on-the-job experience.
farmers like Miguel.
Farms that aren't worlds unto themselves;
farms that restore instead of deplete;
farms that farm extensively
instead of just intensively;
farmers that are not just producers,
but experts in relationships.
Because they're the ones
that are experts in flavor, too.
And if I'm going to be really honest,
they're a better chef than I'll ever be.
You know, I'm okay with that,
because if that's the future of good food, it's going to be delicious.
(Applause)
I only have three minutes
so I'm going to have to talk fast, and it will
use up your spare mental cycles, so multitasking may be hard.
So, 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket
that got me thinking.
I've had some time to think it over.
And energy efficiency is more than just
about the vehicle --
it's also about the road.
of which there are two types: signalized
and unsignalized, which means stop signs.
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections.
Roundabouts are much better.
A study of 24 intersections
has found crashes drop 40 percent
from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout.
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent,
fatal crashes down 90 percent.
But that's just safety.
What about time and gas?
So, traffic keeps flowing, so that means less braking,
which means less accelerating, less gas and less pollution,
less time wasted,
and that partly accounts for Europe's better efficiency
than we have in the United States.
meaning stop signs, they save many lives,
but there's an excessive proliferation of them.
Small roundabouts are starting to appear.
This is one in my neighborhood. And they are
much better -- better than traffic lights, better than four-way stop signs.
They're expensive to install,
but they are more expensive not to. So, we should look at that.
So, take, for example, the three-way intersection.
So, it's logical that you'd have one there,
on the minor road entering the major.
But the other two are somewhat questionable.
So, here's one. There's another one which I studied.
Cars rarely appear on that third road.
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000
cars per day in each direction,
and so that's two ounces of gas to accelerate out of.
That's five cents each, and times 3,000 cars per day,
that's $51,000 per year.
That's just the gasoline cost. There is also pollution,
wear on the car, and time.
What's that time worth?
Well, at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars,
that's 8.3 hours per day. The average wage in the U.S.
is $20 an hour. That is 60,000 per year.
Add that together with the gas, and it's $112,000 per year,
just for that sign in each direction.
over two million dollars
for a stop sign, in each direction.
Now, if you look at what that adjacent property is worth,
you could actually buy the property,
cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line,
and then sell it off again.
And you'd still come out ahead.
So, it makes one wonder, "Why is it there?"
I mean, why is there that stop sign in each direction?
Because it is saving lives. So, is there a better way to accomplish that goal?
to come in from that side road safely.
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there
and if they're waiting forever a long queue could form
because the cars aren't slowing down on the main road.
Can that be accomplished with existing signs?
So, there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs.
Stop signs were invented in 1915,
yield signs in 1950. But that's all we got.
Well the meaning of yield is: You must yield the right-of-way.
That means that if there are five cars waiting, you have to wait
till they all go, then you go. It lacks the notion
of alternating, or taking turns,
and it's always on the minor road,
allowing the major one to have primacy.
So, it's hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign.
You couldn't suddenly tell everyone, "OK, remember
what you used to do at yield signs? Now do something different."
That would not work.
is a new type of sign.
(Applause)
So, you'd have a little instruction below it,
you know, for those who didn't see the public service announcements.
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs.
It's kind of shaped like a T, as in taking turns.
And uncertainty results in caution.
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don't know how to deal with
they slow down.
(Laughter)
don't wait for that sign to be adopted, these things don't change quickly.
But you all are members of communities,
and you can exercise your community influence
to create more sensible traffic flows.
And you can have more impact on the environment
just getting your neighborhood to change these things
than by changing your vehicle. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
(Music)
I'm not a choreographer -- I'm actually a filmmaker, a storyteller.
I directed a movie two years ago
called "Step Up 2: The Streets."
Anybody? Anybody? Yeah!
During that movie I got to meet a ton of hip-hop dancers --
amazing, the best in the world --
and they brought me into a society, the sort of underground
street culture that blew my mind.
I mean, this is literally human beings
with super-human strength and abilities.
They could fly in the air. They could bend their elbow all the way back.
They could spin on their heads for 80 times in a row.
I'd never seen anything like that.
Fred Astaire, Gene Kelly, Michael Jackson.
I grew up in a musical family.
(Laughter)
And those guys, those were like, ultimate heroes.
Being a shy, little, skinny Asian kid growing up in the Silicon Valley
with low self-esteem, those guys made me believe in something bigger.
Those guys made me want to, like, "I'm going to do that
moonwalk at that bar mitzvah tonight for that girl."
sort of relegated to the background of pop stars and music videos.
But after seeing what I've seen,
the truth is, they have not disappeared at all.
They're here, getting better and better every day.
And dance has progressed.
It is insane what dance is right now.
Dance has never had a better friend than technology.
dancers have created a whole global laboratory online
for dance, where kids in Japan are taking moves
from a YouTube video created in Detroit,
building on it within days and releasing a new video,
while teenagers in California are taking the Japanese video and remixing it
with a Philly flair to create a whole new dance style in itself.
And this is happening every day.
with cheap webcams,
lies the world's great dancers of tomorrow.
Our Fred Astaires, our Gene Kellys
our Michael Jacksons are right at our fingertips,
and may not have that opportunity, except for us.
sort of a -- the Legion of Extraordinary Dancers,
a justice league of dancers that believe
that dance can have a transformative effect on the world.
A living, breathing comic book series,
but unlike Spiderman and Iron Man,
these guys can actually do it.
And we're going to show you some today. So, let me introduce to you,
some of our heroes right now.
We got Madd Chadd,
Lil' C, Kid David and J Smooth.
Please be excited, have fun, yell, scream.
Ladies and gentlemen: The LXD.
I get a lot of different reactions actually.
Sometimes you would think that maybe kids would enjoy it,
but sometimes they get a little freaked out.
And, I don't know, I kind of get a kick out of that a little bit.
I actually visually kind of picture
lines, and moving them.
I think of like, Transformers,
like how panels open and then they fold,
they fold in, and then you close that panel.
And then another thing opens,
you close that.
I don't really know what's going on
when I'm dancing.
Because at that point it's just really like, it's my body and the music.
It's not really a conscious decision,
"I'm going to do this next, I'm going to do this."
It's kind of like this other level
where you can't make choices anymore,
and it's just your body reacting to certain sounds in the music.
I got my name just because I was so young.
I was young when I started. I was younger than a lot of the people I was dancing with.
So, it was always like, they called me Kid David, because I was the kid.
and then you just use that ball of energy.
And instead of throwing it out, people would think
that's a krump move, that's a krump move.
That's not a krump move. You're going to throw it out,
you throw it out, and you hold it.
And you let it go, and then right when you see the tail,
you grab it by the tail, then you bring it back in.
And you just got this piece of energy
and you just, you're manipulating it.
You know, you create power, then you tame it.
Last year here at TED
I asked you to give me your data,
to put your data on the web, on the basis
that if people put data onto the web --
government data, scientific data, community data,
whatever it is -- it will be used by other people
to do wonderful things, in ways
that they never could have imagined.
to show you, in fact, there is
an open data movement afoot,
now, around the world.
The cry of "Raw data now!"
which I made people make in the auditorium,
was heard around the world.
So, let's roll the video.
was when in March -- on March 10th in fact, soon after TED --
Paul Clarke, in the U.K. government,
blogged, "Oh, I've just got some raw data. Here it is,
it's about bicycle accidents."
Two days it took the Times Online
to make a map, a mashable map --
we call these things mash-ups --
a mashed-up user interface that allows you to go in there
and have a look and find out whether your bicycle
route to work was affected.
again, put out by the U.K. government,
and because they put it up using the Linked Data standards,
then a user could just make a map,
just by clicking.
Look at Zanesville, Ohio.
Here's a map a lawyer made. He put on it the water plant,
and which houses are there,
which houses have been connected to the water.
And he got, from other data sources,
information to show
which houses are occupied by white people.
Well, there was too much of a correlation, he felt,
between which houses were occupied by white people
and which houses had water, and the judge was not impressed either.
The judge was not impressed to the tune of 10.9 million dollars.
That's the power of taking one piece of data,
another piece of data, putting it together,
and showing the result.
This is U.K. government data, a completely independent site,
Where Does My Money Go.
It allows anybody to go there and burrow down.
You can burrow down by a particular type of spending,
or you can go through all the different regions and compare them.
So, that's happening in the U.K. with U.K. government data.
Here's a site which allows you to look at recovery spending
in California.
Take an arbitrary example, Long Beach, California,
you can go and have a look at what recovery money they've been spending
on different things such as energy.
in the repositories of data.gov,
and data.gov.uk.
And I'm delighted to see a great competition
between the U.K. in blue, and the U.S. in red.
Well, for example, if you have lots of data about places
you can take, from a postcode --
which is like a zip plus four --
for a specific group of houses, you can make paper,
print off a paper which has got very, very
specific things about the bus stops,
the things specifically near you.
of the data which was released about the Afghan elections.
It allows you to set your own criteria
for what sort of things you want to look at.
The red circles are polling stations,
selected by your criteria.
And then you can select also other things on the map
to see what other factors, like the threat level.
So, that was government data.
This is the wiki map, this is the Open Street Map.
"Terrace Theater" I actually put
on the map because it wasn't on the map before TED last year.
I was not the only person editing the open street map.
Each flash on this visualization --
put together by ITO World --
shows an edit in 2009
made to the Open Street Map.
Let's now spin the world during the same year.
Every flash is an edit. Somebody somewhere
looking at the Open Street Map, and realizing it could be better.
You can see Europe is ablaze with updates.
Some places, perhaps not as much as they should be.
The map of Port au-Prince at the end
of 2009 was not all it could be,
not as good as the map of California.
Fortunately, just after the earthquake,
GeoEye, a commercial company,
released satellite imagery
with a license, which allowed
the open-source community to use it.
This is January, in time lapse,
of people editing ... that's the earthquake.
After the earthquake, immediately,
people all over the world, mappers
who wanted to help, and could,
looked at that imagery, built the map, quickly building it up.
The light blue is refugee camps these volunteers had spotted from the [satellite images].
So, now we have, immediately, a real-time map
showing where there are refugee camps --
rapidly became the best map
to use if you're doing relief work in Port-au-Prince.
Witness the fact that it's here on this Garmin device
being used by rescue team in Haiti.
on the left-hand side,
that hospital -- actually that's a hospital ship.
This is a real-time map that shows blocked roads,
damaged buildings, refugee camps --
it shows things that are needed [for rescue and relief work].
I just wanted to say: Whatever you've been doing,
whether you've just been chanting, "Raw data now!"
or you've been putting government or scientific data online,
I just wanted to take this opportunity to say: Thank you very much,
and we have only just started!
(Applause)
I grew up on a steady diet of science fiction.
In high school, I took a bus to school
an hour each way every day.
And I was always absorbed in a book,
science fiction book,
which took my mind to other worlds,
and satisfied, in a narrative form,
this insatiable sense of curiosity that I had.
in the fact that whenever I wasn't in school
I was out in the woods,
hiking and taking "samples" --
frogs and snakes and bugs and pond water --
and bringing it back, looking at it under the microscope.
You know, I was a real science geek.
But it was all about trying to understand the world,
understand the limits of possibility.
actually seemed mirrored in the world around me,
because what was happening, this was in the late '60s,
we were going to the moon,
we were exploring the deep oceans.
Jacques Cousteau was coming into our living rooms
with his amazing specials that showed us
animals and places and a wondrous world
that we could never really have previously imagined.
So, that seemed to resonate
with the whole science fiction part of it.
I could draw. I could paint.
And I found that because there weren't video games
and this saturation of CG movies and all of this
imagery in the media landscape,
I had to create these images in my head.
You know, we all did, as kids having to
read a book, and through the author's description,
put something on the movie screen in our heads.
And so, my response to this was to paint, to draw
alien creatures, alien worlds,
robots, spaceships, all that stuff.
I was endlessly getting busted in math class
doodling behind the textbook.
That was -- the creativity
had to find its outlet somehow.
actually got me very excited about the fact that there was
an alien world right here on Earth.
I might not really go to an alien world
on a spaceship someday --
that seemed pretty darn unlikely.
But that was a world I could really go to,
right here on Earth, that was as rich and exotic
as anything that I had imagined
from reading these books.
at the age of 15.
And the only problem with that was that I lived
in a little village in Canada,
600 miles from the nearest ocean.
But I didn't let that daunt me.
I pestered my father until he finally found
a scuba class in Buffalo, New York,
right across the border from where we live.
And I actually got certified
in a pool at a YMCA in the dead of winter
in Buffalo, New York.
And I didn't see the ocean, a real ocean,
for another two years,
until we moved to California.
40 years,
I've spent about 3,000 hours underwater,
and 500 hours of that was in submersibles.
And I've learned that that deep-ocean environment,
and even the shallow oceans,
are so rich with amazing life
that really is beyond our imagination.
Nature's imagination is so boundless
compared to our own
meager human imagination.
I still, to this day, stand in absolute awe
of what I see when I make these dives.
And my love affair with the ocean is ongoing,
and just as strong as it ever was.
it was filmmaking.
And that seemed to be the best way to reconcile
this urge I had to tell stories
with my urges to create images.
And I was, as a kid, constantly drawing comic books, and so on.
So, filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories
together, and that made sense.
And of course the stories that I chose to tell
were science fiction stories: "Terminator," "Aliens"
and "The Abyss."
And with "The Abyss," I was putting together my love
of underwater and diving with filmmaking.
So, you know, merging the two passions.
which was that to solve a specific narrative
problem on that film,
which was to create this kind of liquid water creature,
we actually embraced computer generated animation, CG.
And this resulted in the first soft-surface
character, CG animation
that was ever in a movie.
And even though the film didn't make any money --
barely broke even, I should say --
I witnessed something amazing, which is that the audience,
the global audience, was mesmerized
by this apparent magic.
that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
They were seeing something magical.
And so that got me very excited.
And I thought, "Wow, this is something that needs to be embraced
into the cinematic art."
So, with "Terminator 2," which was my next film,
we took that much farther.
Working with ILM, we created the liquid metal dude
in that film. The success hung in the balance
on whether that effect would work.
And it did, and we created magic again,
and we had the same result with an audience --
although we did make a little more money on that one.
of experience
came to, "This is going to be a whole new world,"
this was a whole new world of creativity
for film artists.
So, I started a company with Stan Winston,
my good friend Stan Winston,
who is the premier make-up and creature designer
at that time, and it was called Digital Domain.
And the concept of the company was
that we would leapfrog past
the analog processes of optical printers and so on,
and we would go right to digital production.
And we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while.
in the creature and character design stuff
that we had actually founded the company to do.
So, I wrote this piece called "Avatar,"
which was meant to absolutely push the envelope
of visual effects,
of CG effects, beyond,
with realistic human emotive characters
generated in CG,
and the main characters would all be in CG,
and the world would be in CG.
And the envelope pushed back,
and I was told by the folks at my company
that we weren't going to be able to do this for a while.
(Laughter)
You know, I went and pitched it to the studio as "'Romeo and Juliet' on a ship:
"It's going to be this epic romance,
passionate film."
Secretly, what I wanted to do was
I wanted to dive to the real wreck of "Titanic."
And that's why I made the movie.
(Applause)
And that's the truth. Now, the studio didn't know that.
But I convinced them. I said,
"We're going to dive to the wreck. We're going to film it for real.
We'll be using it in the opening of the film.
It will be really important. It will be a great marketing hook."
And I talked them into funding an expedition.
(Laughter)
about your imagination creating a reality.
Because we actually created a reality where six months later,
I find myself in a Russian submersible
two and a half miles down in the north Atlantic,
looking at the real Titanic through a view port.
Not a movie, not HD -- for real.
(Applause)
And it took a lot of preparation, we had to build cameras
and lights and all kinds of things.
But, it struck me how much
this dive, these deep dives,
was like a space mission.
You know, where it was highly technical,
and it required enormous planning.
You get in this capsule, you go down to this dark
hostile environment
where there is no hope of rescue
if you can't get back by yourself.
And I thought like, "Wow. I'm like,
living in a science fiction movie.
This is really cool."
Of course, the curiosity, the science component of it --
it was everything. It was adventure,
it was curiosity, it was imagination.
And it was an experience that
Hollywood couldn't give me.
Because, you know, I could imagine a creature and we could
create a visual effect for it. But I couldn't imagine what I was seeing
out that window.
As we did some of our subsequent expeditions,
I was seeing creatures at hydrothermal vents
and sometimes things that I had never seen before,
sometimes things that no one had seen before,
that actually were not described by science
at the time that we saw them and imaged them.
and had to do more.
And so, I actually made a kind of curious decision.
After the success of "Titanic,"
I said, "OK, I'm going to park my day job
as a Hollywood movie maker,
and I'm going to go be a full-time explorer for a while."
And so, we started planning these
expeditions.
And we wound up going to the Bismark,
and exploring it with robotic vehicles.
We went back to the Titanic wreck.
We took little bots that we had created
that spooled a fiber optic.
And the idea was to go in and do an interior
survey of that ship, which had never been done.
Nobody had ever looked inside the wreck. They didn't have the means to do it,
so we created technology to do it.
of Titanic, sitting in a submersible,
and looking out at planks that look much like this,
where I knew that the band had played.
And I'm flying a little robotic vehicle
through the corridor of the ship.
When I say, "I'm operating it,"
but my mind is in the vehicle.
I felt like I was physically present
inside the shipwreck of Titanic.
And it was the most surreal kind
of deja vu experience I've ever had,
because I would know before I turned a corner
what was going to be there before the lights
of the vehicle actually revealed it,
because I had walked the set for months
when we were making the movie.
And the set was based as an exact replica
on the blueprints of the ship.
And it really made me realize that
the telepresence experience --
that you actually can have these robotic avatars,
then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle,
into this other form of existence.
It was really, really quite profound.
And it may be a little bit of a glimpse as to what might be happening
some decades out
as we start to have cyborg bodies
for exploration or for other means
in many sort of
post-human futures
that I can imagine,
as a science fiction fan.
and really beginning to appreciate what was down there,
such as at the deep ocean vents
where we had these amazing, amazing animals --
they're basically aliens right here on Earth.
They live in an environment of chemosynthesis.
They don't survive on sunlight-based
system the way we do.
And so, you're seeing animals that are living next to
a 500-degree-Centigrade
water plumes.
You think they can't possibly exist.
I was getting very interested in space science as well --
again, it's the science fiction influence, as a kid.
And I wound up getting involved with
the space community,
really involved with NASA,
sitting on the NASA advisory board,
planning actual space missions,
going to Russia, going through the pre-cosmonaut
biomedical protocols,
and all these sorts of things,
to actually go and fly to the international space station
with our 3D camera systems.
And this was fascinating.
But what I wound up doing was bringing space scientists
with us into the deep.
And taking them down so that they had access --
astrobiologists, planetary scientists,
people who were interested in these extreme environments --
taking them down to the vents, and letting them see,
and take samples and test instruments, and so on.
but actually doing science,
and actually doing space science.
I'd completely closed the loop
between being the science fiction fan,
you know, as a kid,
and doing this stuff for real.
And you know, along the way in this journey
of discovery,
I learned a lot.
I learned a lot about science. But I also learned a lot
about leadership.
Now you think director has got to be a leader,
leader of, captain of the ship, and all that sort of thing.
until I did these expeditions.
Because I had to, at a certain point, say,
"What am I doing out here?
Why am I doing this? What do I get out of it?"
We don't make money at these damn shows.
We barely break even. There is no fame in it.
People sort of think I went away
between "Titanic" and "Avatar" and was buffing my nails
someplace, sitting at the beach.
Made all these films, made all these documentary films
for a very limited audience.
You're doing it for the task itself,
for the challenge --
and the ocean is the most challenging environment there is --
for the thrill of discovery,
and for that strange bond that happens
when a small group of people form a tightly knit team.
Because we would do these things with 10, 12 people,
working for years at a time,
sometimes at sea for two, three months at a time.
that the most important thing
is the respect that you have for them
and that they have for you, that you've done a task
that you can't explain to someone else.
When you come back to the shore and you say,
"We had to do this, and the fiber optic, and the attentuation,
and the this and the that,
all the technology of it, and the difficulty,
the human-performance aspects of working at sea,"
you can't explain it to people. It's that thing that
maybe cops have, or people in combat that have gone through something together
and they know they can never explain it.
Creates a bond, creates a bond of respect.
which was "Avatar,"
I tried to apply that same principle of leadership,
which is that you respect your team,
and you earn their respect in return.
And it really changed the dynamic.
So, here I was again with a small team,
in uncharted territory,
doing "Avatar," coming up with new technology
that didn't exist before.
Tremendously exciting.
Tremendously challenging.
And we became a family, over a four-and-half year period.
And it completely changed how I do movies.
So, people have commented on how, "Well, you know,
you brought back the ocean organisms
and put them on the planet of Pandora."
To me, it was more of a fundamental way of doing business,
the process itself, that changed as a result of that.
You know, what are the lessons learned?
Well, I think number one is
curiosity.
It's the most powerful thing you own.
Imagination is a force
that can actually manifest a reality.
And the respect of your team
is more important than all the
laurels in the world.
I have young filmmakers
come up to me and say, "Give me some advice for doing this."
And I say, "Don't put limitations on yourself.
Other people will do that for you -- don't do it to yourself,
don't bet against yourself,
and take risks."
"Failure is not an option."
But failure has to be an option
in art and in exploration, because it's a leap of faith.
And no important endeavor
that required innovation
was done without risk.
You have to be willing to take those risks.
So, that's the thought I would leave you with,
is that in whatever you're doing,
failure is an option,
but fear is not. Thank you.
(Applause)
If I can leave you with one big idea today,
it's that the whole of the data
in which we consume
is greater that the sum of the parts,
and instead of thinking about information overload,
what I'd like you to think about is how
we can use information so that patterns pop
and we can see trends that would otherwise be invisible.
organized by age.
This tool that I'm using here is a little experiment.
It's called Pivot, and with Pivot what I can do
is I can choose to filter in one particular cause of deaths -- say, accidents.
And, right away, I see there's a different pattern that emerges.
This is because, in the mid-area here,
people are at their most active,
and over here they're at their most frail.
We can step back out again
and then reorganize the data by cause of death,
seeing that circulatory diseases and cancer
are the usual suspects, but not for everyone.
If we go ahead and we filter by age --
say 40 years or less --
we see that accidents are actually
the greatest cause that people have to be worried about.
And if you drill into that, it's especially the case for men.
that viewing information, viewing data in this way,
is a lot like swimming
in a living information info-graphic.
And if we can do this for raw data,
why not do it for content as well?
So what we have right here
is the cover of every single Sports Illustrated
ever produced.
It's all here; it's all on the web.
You can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk.
With Pivot, you can drill into a decade.
You can drill into a particular year.
You can jump right into a specific issue.
So I'm looking at this; I see the athletes
that have appeared in this issue, the sports.
I'm a Lance Armstrong fan, so I'll go ahead and I'll click on that,
which reveals, for me, all the issues
in which Lance Armstrong's been a part of.
I might think,
"Well, what about taking a look at all of cycling?"
So I can step back, and expand on that.
And I see Greg LeMond now.
And so you get the idea that when you
navigate over information this way --
going narrower, broader,
backing in, backing out --
you're not searching, you're not browsing.
You're doing something that's actually a little bit different.
It's in between, and we think it changes
the way information can be used.
with something that's a little bit crazy.
What we're done here is we've taken every single Wikipedia page
and we reduced it down to a little summary.
So the summary consists of just a little synopsis
and an icon to indicate the topical area that it comes from.
I'm only showing the top 500
most popular Wikipedia pages right here.
But even in this limited view,
we can do a lot of things.
Right away, we get a sense of what are the topical domains
that are most popular on Wikipedia.
I'm going to go ahead and select government.
Now, having selected government,
I can now see that the Wikipedia categories
that most frequently correspond to that
are Time magazine People of the Year.
So this is really important because this is an insight
that was not contained within any one Wikipedia page.
It's only possible to see that insight
when you step back and look at all of them.
I can then drill into the concept of
Time magazine Person of the Year,
bringing up all of them.
So looking at these people,
I can see that the majority come from government;
some have come from natural sciences;
some, fewer still, have come from business --
there's my boss --
and one has come from music.
And interestingly enough,
Bono is also a TED Prize winner.
So we can go, jump, and take a look at all the TED Prize winners.
So you see, we're navigating the web for the first time
as if it's actually a web, not from page-to-page,
but at a higher level of abstraction.
that may catch you a little bit by surprise.
I'm just showing the New York Times website here.
So Pivot, this application --
I don't want to call it a browser; it's really not a browser,
but you can view web pages with it --
and we bring that zoomable technology
to every single web page like this.
So I can step back,
pop right back into a specific section.
Now the reason why this is important is because,
by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way,
I can look at my entire browsing history
in the exact same way.
So I can drill into what I've done
over specific time frames.
Here, in fact, is the state
of all the demo that I just gave.
And I can sort of replay some stuff that I was looking at earlier today.
And, if I want to step back and look at everything,
I can slice and dice my history,
perhaps by my search history --
here, I was doing some nepotistic searching,
looking for Bing, over here for Live Labs Pivot.
And from these, I can drill into the web page
and just launch them again.
It's one metaphor repurposed multiple times,
and in each case it makes the whole greater
than the sum of the parts with the data.
we think about data as being this curse.
We talk about the curse of information overload.
We talk about drowning in data.
What if we can actually turn that upside down
and turn the web upside down,
so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next,
we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things,
and then being able to see the patterns
that were otherwise hidden?
If we can do that, then instead of being trapped in data,
we might actually extract information.
And, instead of dealing just with information,
we can tease out knowledge.
And if we get the knowledge, then maybe even there's wisdom to be found.
Everybody talks about happiness these days.
I had somebody count the number of books
with "happiness" in the title published in the last five years
and they gave up after about 40, and there were many more.
There is a huge wave of interest in happiness,
among researchers.
There is a lot of happiness coaching.
Everybody would like to make people happier.
But in spite of all this flood of work,
there are several cognitive traps
that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight
about happiness.
This applies to laypeople thinking about their own happiness,
and it applies to scholars thinking about happiness,
because it turns out we're just as messed up as anybody else is.
The first of these traps
is a reluctance to admit complexity.
It turns out that the word "happiness"
is just not a useful word anymore,
because we apply it to too many different things.
I think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it,
but by and large,
this is something that we'll have to give up
and we'll have to adopt the more complicated view
of what well-being is.
The second trap is a confusion between experience and memory;
basically, it's between being happy in your life,
and being happy about your life
or happy with your life.
And those are two very different concepts,
and they're both lumped in the notion of happiness.
And the third is the focusing illusion,
and it's the unfortunate fact that we can't think about any circumstance
that affects well-being
without distorting its importance.
I mean, this is a real cognitive trap.
There's just no way of getting it right.
of somebody who had a question-and-answer session
after one of my lectures reported a story,
and that was a story --
He said he'd been listening to a symphony,
and it was absolutely glorious music
and at the very end of the recording,
there was a dreadful screeching sound.
And then he added, really quite emotionally,
it ruined the whole experience.
But it hadn't.
What it had ruined were the memories of the experience.
He had had the experience.
He had had 20 minutes of glorious music.
They counted for nothing
because he was left with a memory;
the memory was ruined,
and the memory was all that he had gotten to keep.
is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people
in terms of two selves.
There is an experiencing self,
who lives in the present
and knows the present,
is capable of re-living the past,
but basically it has only the present.
It's the experiencing self that the doctor approaches --
you know, when the doctor asks,
"Does it hurt now when I touch you here?"
And then there is a remembering self,
and the remembering self is the one that keeps score,
and maintains the story of our life,
and it's the one that the doctor approaches
in asking the question,
"How have you been feeling lately?"
or "How was your trip to Albania?" or something like that.
Those are two very different entities,
the experiencing self and the remembering self,
and getting confused between them is part of the mess
about the notion of happiness.
is a storyteller.
And that really starts with a basic response of our memories --
it starts immediately.
We don't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories.
Our memory tells us stories,
that is, what we get to keep from our experiences
is a story.
And let me begin with one example.
This is an old study.
Those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure.
I won't go into detail. It's no longer painful these days,
but it was painful when this study was run in the 1990s.
They were asked to report on their pain every 60 seconds.
Here are two patients,
those are their recordings.
And you are asked, "Who of them suffered more?"
And it's a very easy question.
Clearly, Patient B suffered more --
his colonoscopy was longer,
and every minute of pain that Patient A had,
Patient B had, and more.
"How much did these patients think they suffered?"
And here is a surprise.
The surprise is that Patient A
had a much worse memory of the colonoscopy
than Patient B.
The stories of the colonoscopies were different,
and because a very critical part of the story is how it ends.
And neither of these stories is very inspiring or great --
but one of them is this distinct ... (Laughter)
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other.
And the one that is worse
is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end;
it's a bad story.
How do we know that?
Because we asked these people after their colonoscopy,
and much later, too,
"How bad was the whole thing, in total?"
And it was much worse for A than for B, in memory.
between the experiencing self and the remembering self.
From the point of view of the experiencing self,
clearly, B had a worse time.
Now, what you could do with Patient A,
and we actually ran clinical experiments,
and it has been done, and it does work --
you could actually extend the colonoscopy of Patient A
by just keeping the tube in without jiggling it too much.
That will cause the patient
to suffer, but just a little
and much less than before.
And if you do that for a couple of minutes,
you have made the experiencing self
of Patient A worse off,
and you have the remembering self of Patient A
a lot better off,
because now you have endowed Patient A
with a better story
about his experience.
What defines a story?
And that is true of the stories
that memory delivers for us,
and it's also true of the stories that we make up.
What defines a story are changes,
significant moments and endings.
Endings are very, very important
and, in this case, the ending dominated.
lives its life continuously.
It has moments of experience, one after the other.
And you can ask: What happens to these moments?
And the answer is really straightforward:
They are lost forever.
I mean, most of the moments of our life --
and I calculated, you know, the psychological present
is said to be about three seconds long;
that means that, you know,
in a life there are about 600 million of them;
in a month, there are about 600,000 --
most of them don't leave a trace.
Most of them are completely ignored
by the remembering self.
And yet, somehow you get the sense
that they should count,
that what happens during these moments of experience
is our life.
It's the finite resource that we're spending
while we're on this earth.
And how to spend it
would seem to be relevant,
but that is not the story
that the remembering self keeps for us.
and the experiencing self,
and they're really quite distinct.
The biggest difference between them
is in the handling of time.
From the point of view of the experiencing self,
if you have a vacation,
and the second week is just as good as the first,
then the two-week vacation
is twice as good as the one-week vacation.
That's not the way it works at all for the remembering self.
For the remembering self, a two-week vacation
is barely better than the one-week vacation
because there are no new memories added.
You have not changed the story.
And in this way,
time is actually the critical variable
that distinguishes a remembering self
from an experiencing self;
time has very little impact on the story.
than remember and tell stories.
It is actually the one that makes decisions
because, if you have a patient who has had, say,
two colonoscopies with two different surgeons
and is deciding which of them to choose,
then the one that chooses
is the one that has the memory that is less bad,
and that's the surgeon that will be chosen.
The experiencing self
has no voice in this choice.
We actually don't choose between experiences,
we choose between memories of experiences.
And even when we think about the future,
we don't think of our future normally as experiences.
We think of our future
as anticipated memories.
And basically you can look at this,
you know, as a tyranny of the remembering self,
and you can think of the remembering self
sort of dragging the experiencing self
through experiences that
the experiencing self doesn't need.
when we go on vacations
this is very frequently the case;
that is, we go on vacations,
to a very large extent,
in the service of our remembering self.
And this is a bit hard to justify I think.
I mean, how much do we consume our memories?
That is one of the explanations
that is given for the dominance
of the remembering self.
And when I think about that, I think about a vacation
we had in Antarctica a few years ago,
which was clearly the best vacation I've ever had,
and I think of it relatively often,
relative to how much I think of other vacations.
And I probably have consumed
my memories of that three-week trip, I would say,
for about 25 minutes in the last four years.
Now, if I had ever opened the folder
with the 600 pictures in it,
I would have spent another hour.
Now, that is three weeks,
and that is at most an hour and a half.
There seems to be a discrepancy.
Now, I may be a bit extreme, you know,
in how little appetite I have for consuming memories,
but even if you do more of this,
there is a genuine question:
Why do we put so much weight on memory
relative to the weight that we put on experiences?
about a thought experiment.
Imagine that for your next vacation,
you know that at the end of the vacation
all your pictures will be destroyed,
and you'll get an amnesic drug
so that you won't remember anything.
Now, would you choose the same vacation? (Laughter)
And if you would choose a different vacation,
there is a conflict between your two selves,
and you need to think about how to adjudicate that conflict,
and it's actually not at all obvious, because
if you think in terms of time,
then you get one answer,
and if you think in terms of memories,
you might get another answer.
Why do we pick the vacations we do
is a problem that confronts us
with a choice between the two selves.
bring up two notions of happiness.
There are really two concepts of happiness
that we can apply, one per self.
So you can ask: How happy is the experiencing self?
And then you would ask: How happy are the moments
in the experiencing self's life?
And they're all -- happiness for moments
is a fairly complicated process.
What are the emotions that can be measured?
And, by the way, now we are capable
of getting a pretty good idea
of the happiness of the experiencing self over time.
If you ask for the happiness of the remembering self,
it's a completely different thing.
This is not about how happily a person lives.
It is about how satisfied or pleased the person is
when that person thinks about her life.
Very different notion.
Anyone who doesn't distinguish those notions
is going to mess up the study of happiness,
and I belong to a crowd of students of well-being,
who've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time
in precisely this way.
happiness of the experiencing self
and the satisfaction of the remembering self
has been recognized in recent years,
and there are now efforts to measure the two separately.
The Gallup Organization has a world poll
where more than half a million people
have been asked questions
about what they think of their life
and about their experiences,
and there have been other efforts along those lines.
So in recent years, we have begun to learn
about the happiness of the two selves.
And the main lesson I think that we have learned
is they are really different.
You can know how satisfied somebody is with their life,
and that really doesn't teach you much
about how happily they're living their life,
and vice versa.
Just to give you a sense of the correlation,
the correlation is about .5.
What that means is if you met somebody,
and you were told, "Oh his father is six feet tall,"
how much would you know about his height?
Well, you would know something about his height,
but there's a lot of uncertainty.
You have that much uncertainty.
If I tell you that somebody ranked their life eight on a scale of ten,
you have a lot of uncertainty
about how happy they are
with their experiencing self.
So the correlation is low.
satisfaction of the happiness self.
We know that money is very important,
goals are very important.
We know that happiness is mainly
being satisfied with people that we like,
spending time with people that we like.
There are other pleasures, but this is dominant.
So if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves,
you are going to end up
doing very different things.
The bottom line of what I've said here
is that we really should not think of happiness
as a substitute for well-being.
It is a completely different notion.
another reason we cannot think straight about happiness
is that we do not attend to the same things
when we think about life, and we actually live.
So, if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in California,
you are not going to get to the correct answer.
When you ask that question,
you think people must be happier in California
if, say, you live in Ohio.
(Laughter)
And what happens is
when you think about living in California,
you are thinking of the contrast
between California and other places,
and that contrast, say, is in climate.
Well, it turns out that climate
is not very important to the experiencing self
and it's not even very important to the reflective self
that decides how happy people are.
But now, because the reflective self is in charge,
you may end up -- some people may end up
moving to California.
And it's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen
to people who move to California in the hope of getting happier.
Well, their experiencing self
is not going to get happier.
We know that.
But one thing will happen: They will think they are happier,
because, when they think about it,
they'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in Ohio,
and they will feel they made the right decision.
to think straight about well-being,
and I hope I have given you a sense
of how difficult it is.
Thank you so much.
Now, when we were on the phone a few weeks ago,
you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result
came out of that Gallup survey.
Is that something you can share
since you do have a few moments left now?
I think the most interesting result that we found in the Gallup survey
is a number, which we absolutely did not expect to find.
We found that with respect to the happiness
of the experiencing self.
When we looked at how feelings,
vary with income.
And it turns out that, below an income
of 60,000 dollars a year, for Americans --
and that's a very large sample of Americans, like 600,000,
so it's a large representative sample --
below an income of 600,000 dollars a year...
(Laughter)
60,000 dollars a year, people are unhappy,
and they get progressively unhappier the poorer they get.
Above that, we get an absolutely flat line.
I mean I've rarely seen lines so flat.
Clearly, what is happening is
money does not buy you experiential happiness,
but lack of money certainly buys you misery,
and we can measure that misery
very, very clearly.
In terms of the other self, the remembering self,
you get a different story.
The more money you earn, the more satisfied you are.
That does not hold for emotions.
life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness.
If people took seriously that finding,
I mean, it seems to turn upside down
everything we believe about, like for example,
taxation policy and so forth.
Is there any chance that politicians, that the country generally,
would take a finding like that seriously
and run public policy based on it?
of the role of happiness research in public policy.
The recognition is going to be slow in the United States,
no question about that,
but in the U.K., it is happening,
and in other countries it is happening.
People are recognizing that they ought
to be thinking of happiness
when they think of public policy.
It's going to take a while,
and people are going to debate
whether they want to study experience happiness,
or whether they want to study life evaluation,
so we need to have that debate fairly soon.
How to enhance happiness
goes very different ways depending on how you think,
and whether you think of the remembering self
or you think of the experiencing self.
This is going to influence policy, I think, in years to come.
In the United States, efforts are being made
to measure the experience happiness of the population.
This is going to be, I think, within the next decade or two,
part of national statistics.
the most interesting policy discussion to track
over the next few years.
Thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics.
Thank you, Danny Kahneman.
drawing the bust of a nude by Michelangelo.
I was sent straight away to my school principal,
and my school principal, a sweet nun,
looked at my book with disgust,
flipped through the pages, saw all the nudes --
you know, I'd been seeing my mother draw nudes and I'd copy her --
and the nun slapped me on my face and said,
"Sweet Jesus, this kid has already begun."
but it was convincing enough for me never to draw again
until the ninth grade.
Thanks to a really boring lecture,
I started caricaturing my teachers in school.
And, you know, I got a lot of popularity.
I don't play sports. I'm really bad at sports.
I don't have the fanciest gadgets at home.
I'm not on top of the class.
So for me, cartooning gave me a sense of identity.
I got popular, but I was scared I'd get caught again.
So what I did was I quickly put together
a collage of all the teachers I had drawn,
glorified my school principal, put him right on top,
and gifted it to him.
He had a good laugh at the other teachers
and put it up on the notice board.
(Laughter)
This is a part of that.
And I became a school hero.
All my seniors knew me. I felt really special.
That's my mother. I love her to bits.
She's a bit of a hippie.
She said, "Don't say that," but I'm saying it anyway.
The rest of my family are boring academics,
busy collecting Ivy League decals for our classic Ambassador car.
My father's a little different.
My father believed in a holistic approach to living,
and, you know, every time he taught us,
he'd say, "I hate these books,
because these books are hijacked by Industrial Revolution."
I got the best lawyer in town,
my older brother Karthik,
and I sat him down, and I said, "Pa,
from today onwards I've decided
I'm going to be disciplined,
I'm going to be curious,
I'm going to learn something new every day,
I'm going to be very hard working,
and I'm not going to depend on you
emotionally or financially."
And he was very impressed. He was all tearing up. Ready to hug me.
And I said, "Hold that thought."
I said, "Can I quit school then?"
I quit school to pursue a career as a cartoonist.
I must have done about 30,000 caricatures.
I would do birthday parties, weddings, divorces,
anything for anyone who wanted to use my services.
But, most importantly, while I was traveling,
I taught children cartooning,
and in exchange, I learned how to be spontaneous.
And mad and crazy and fun.
When I started teaching them, I said let me start doing this professionally.
When I was 18 I started my own school.
However, an 18 year-old trying to start a school
is not easy unless you have a big patron
or a big supporter.
when I saw that the Prime Minister of India
was visiting my home town, Bangalore.
And, you know, just like how
every cartoonist knows Bush here,
and if you had to meet Bush,
his face was a cartoonist's delight.
I had to meet my Prime Minister.
I went to the place where
his helicopter was about to land.
I saw layers of security.
I caricatured my way through three layers
by just impressing the guards,
but I got stuck. I got stuck at the third.
And what happened was, to my luck,
I saw a nuclear scientist
at whose party I had done cartoons.
I ran up to him, and said, "Hello, sir. How do you do?"
He said, "What are you doing here, Raghava?"
I said, "I'm here to meet the Prime Minister."
He said, "Oh, so am I."
I hopped into his car, and off we went
through the remaining layers of security.
(Applause)
Thank you.
I sat him down, I caricatured him,
and since then I've caricatured hundreds of celebrities.
Salman Rushdie was pissed-off I think
because I altered the map of New York, if you notice.
(Laughter)
Anyway, the next slide I'm about to show you --
Should I just turn that off?
The next slide I'm about to show you,
is a little more serious.
I was hesitant to include this in my presentation
because this cartoon was published
soon after 9/11.
What was, for me, a very naive observation,
turned out to be a disaster.
That evening, I came home to hundreds of hate mails,
hundreds of people telling me how they
could have lived another day without seeing this.
I was also asked to leave the organization,
a cartoonists' organization in America,
that for me was my lifeline.
That's when I realized, you know, cartoons are really powerful,
art comes with responsibility.
that I need to take a break.
I quit my job at the papers, I closed my school,
and I wrapped up my pencils and my brushes and inks,
and I decided to go traveling.
When I went traveling, I remember,
I met this fabulous old man,
who I met when I was caricaturing,
who turned out to be an artist, in Italy.
He invited me to his studio. He said, "Come and visit."
When I went, I saw the ghastliest thing ever.
I saw this dead, naked effigy of himself
hanging from the ceiling.
I said, "Oh, my God. What is that?"
And I asked him, and he said,
"Oh, that thing? In the night, I die.
In the morning, I am born again."
I thought he was koo koo,
but something about that really stuck.
I loved it. I thought there was something really beautiful about that.
So I said, "I am dead, so I need to be born again."
except, I don't know how to paint.
So, I tried going to the art store.
You know, there are a hundred types of brushes.
Forget it, they will confuse you
even if you know how to draw.
So I decided, I'm going to learn to paint by myself.
I'm going to show you a very quick clip
to show you how I painted and a little bit
about my city, Bangalore.
(Music)
They had to be larger than life.
Everything had to be larger. The next painting was even bigger.
And even bigger.
And for me it was, I had to dance while I painted.
It was so exciting.
Except, I even started painting dancers.
Here for example is a Flamenco dancer,
except there was one problem.
I didn't know the dance form, so I started following them,
and I made some money,
sold my paintings and would rush off
to France or Spain and work with them.
That's Pepe Linares, the renowned Flamenco singer.
As much energy as I put into them
while making them, they never danced.
So I decided -- I had this crazy epiphany at two in the morning.
I called my friends, painted on their bodies,
and had them dance in front of a painting.
And, all of a sudden, my paintings came alive.
And then I was fortunate enough
to actually perform this in California with Velocity Circus.
And I sat like you guys there in the audience.
And I saw my work come alive.
You know, normally you work in isolation,
and you show at a gallery,
but here, the work was coming alive,
and it had some other artists working with me.
I said, I'm going to collaborate with anybody and everybody I meet.
I started doing fashion.
This is a fashion show we held in London.
The best collaboration, of course, is with children.
They are ruthless, they are honest,
but they're full of energy and fun.
This is a work, a library I designed for the Robin Hood Foundation.
And I must say, I spent time in the Bronx
working with these kids.
And, in exchange for me working with them,
they taught me how to be cool.
but I want to paint like a real painter.
American education is so expensive.
I was in India, and I was walking down the streets,
and I saw a billboard painter.
And these guys paint humongous paintings,
and they look really good.
And I wondered how they did it from so close.
So, one day I had the opportunity to meet one of these guys,
and I said, "How do you paint like that? Who taught you?"
And he said, "Oh, it's very easy. I can teach you,
but we're leaving the city,
because billboard painters are a dying,
extinct bunch of artists,
because digital printing has totally replaced them and hijacked them."
I said, in exchange for education in how to paint,
I will support them, and I started a company.
And since then, I've been painting all over the place.
This is a painting I did of my wife in my apartment.
This is another painting.
And, in fact, I started painting on anything,
and started sending them around town.
has been with her, Netra.
Netra and I met when she was 18.
I must have been 19 and a half then,
and it was love at first sight.
I lived in India. She lived in America.
She'd come every two months to visit me,
and then I said I'm the man,
I'm the man, and I have to reciprocate.
I have to travel seven oceans, and I have to come and see you.
I did that twice, and I went broke.
So then I said, "Nets, what do I do?"
She said, "Why don't you send me your paintings?
My dad knows a bunch of rich guys.
We'll try and con them into buying it,
and then..."
But it turned out, after I sent the works to her,
that her dad's friends,
like most of you, are geeks.
I'm joking.
(Laughter)
No, they were really big geeks,
and they didn't know much about art.
So Netra was stuck with 30 paintings of mine.
and we drove all over the east coast trying to sell it.
She contacted anyone and everyone
who was willing to buy my work.
She made enough money, she sold off the whole collection
and made enough money to move me for four years
with lawyers, a company, everything,
and she became my manager.
That's us in New York.
Notice one thing,
we're equal here.
Something happened along the line.
(Laughter)
it brought me a lot of success.
I was really happy. I thought of myself as a bit of a rockstar.
I loved the attention.
This is all the press we got, and we said,
it's time to celebrate.
And I said that the best way to celebrate is to marry Netra.
I said, "Let's get married."
And I said, "Not just married. Let's invite everyone who's helped us,
all the people who bought our work."
And you won't believe it, we put together a list of 7,000 people,
who had made a difference -- a ridiculous list,
but I was determined to bring them to India, so --
a lot of them were in India.
150 artists volunteered to help me with my wedding.
We had fashion designers, installation artists,
models, we had makeup artists, jewelry designers,
all kinds of people working with me
to make my wedding an art installation.
And I had a special installation in tribute to my in-laws.
I had the vegetable carvers work on that for me.
to the press writing about us.
We were in the papers, we're still in the news three years later,
but, unfortunately, something tragic happened right after.
My mother fell very ill.
I love my mother
and I was told all of a sudden that she was going to die.
And they said you have to say bye to her,
you have to do what you have to do.
And I was devastated.
I had shows booked up for another year.
I was on a high.
And I couldn't. I could not.
I could not live this larger than life person.
I started exploring the darker abscesses of the human mind.
Of course, my work turned ugly,
but another thing happened.
I lost all my audiences.
The Bollywood stars who I would party with
and buy my work disappeared.
The collectors, the friends, the press,
everyone said, "Nice, but thank you."
"No thank you," was more like it.
But I wanted people to actually
feel my work from their gut,
because I was painting it from my gut.
If they wanted beauty,
I said, this is the beauty I'm willing to give you. It's politicized.
Of course, none of them liked it.
At this point, something else happened.
A very, very dear friend of mine
came out of the closet,
and in India at that time, it was illegal to be gay,
and it's disgusting to see how people respond to a gay person.
I was very upset.
I remember the time when my mother used to dress me up
as a little girl -- that's me there --
because she wanted a girl, and she has only boys.
(Laughter)
Anyway, I don't know what my friends are going to say after this talk.
It's a secret.
I talked about this masculinity that one need not perform.
And I talked about the weakness of male sexuality.
This time, not only did my collectors disappear,
the political activists decided to ban me
and to threaten me
and to forbid me from showing.
It turned nasty, and I'm a bit of a chicken.
I can't deal with any threat. This was a big threat.
to end and go back home.
This time I said let's try something different.
I need to be reborn again.
And I thought the best way, as most of you know who have children,
the best way to have a new lease on life,
is to have a child.
I decided to have a child,
and before I did that, I quickly studied what can go wrong.
How can a family get dysfunctional?
And Rudra was born.
That's my little son.
My mother miraculously recovered
after a serious operation,
and this man was elected president of this country.
You know I sat at home and I watched.
I teared up and I said that's where I want to be.
So Netra and I wound up our life,
closed up everything we had,
and we decided to move to New York.
And this was just eight months ago.
Everything about my work has become more whimsical.
This one is called "What the Fuck Was I Thinking?"
It talks about mental incest.
You know, I may appear to be a very nice, clean, sweet boy.
But I'm not. I'm capable of thinking anything.
But I'm very civil in my action, I assure you.
(Laughter)
These are just different cartoons.
I was talking to mother and father this morning,
but you have to talk about your work with children."
So I said, okay.
and that's an entirely different talk,
but I want to leave you with one story
that really, really inspired me.
I met Belinda when she was 16.
I was 17.
I was in Australia,
and Belinda had cancer,
and I was told she's not going to live very long.
They, in fact, told me three weeks.
I walk into her room, and there was a shy girl,
and she was bald, and she was trying to hide her baldness.
I whipped out my pen, and I started drawing on her head
and I drew a crown for her.
And then, we started talking, and we spent a lovely time --
I told her how I ended up in Australia,
how I backpacked and who I conned, and how I got a ticket,
and all the stories.
And I drew it out for her.
And then I left.
Belinda died
and within a few days of her death,
they published a book for her,
and she used my cartoon on the cover.
And she wrote a little note, she said,
"Hey Rags, thank you for the magic carpet ride around the world."
I hope you will join me in this magic carpet ride,
and touch children and be honest.
Thank you so much.
(Applause)
you will very likely have to contend with
The first bad news
are extremely slim to none,
and that's because most of the blindness
alleviation programs in the country
are focused on adults,
and there are very, very few hospitals
that are actually equipped to treat children.
In fact, if you were to be treated,
you might well end up being treated
by a person who has no medical credentials
as this case from Rajasthan illustrates.
This is a three-year-old orphan girl
who had cataracts.
So, her caretakers took her
to the village medicine man,
that the girl be taken to a hospital,
the person decided to burn her abdomen
with red-hot iron bars
to drive out the demons.
will be delivered to you
by neuroscientists, who will tell you
that if you are older than four or five years of age,
that even if you have your eye corrected,
both because of personal reasons
and scientific reasons.
So let me first start with the personal reason.
It'll sound corny, but it's sincere.
That's my son, Darius.
As a new father,
I have a qualitatively different sense
of just how delicate babies are,
what our obligations are towards them
and how much love
we can feel towards a child.
I would move heaven and earth
in order to get treatment for Darius,
and for me to be told
that there might be other Dariuses
who are not getting treatment,
that's just viscerally wrong.
So that's the personal reason.
than four or five years of age,
it loses its ability to learn --
that doesn't sit well with me,
because I don't think that idea
has been tested adequately.
for their studies of visual physiology,
which are remarkably beautiful studies,
but I believe some of their work
has been extrapolated
into the human domain prematurely.
So, they did their work with kittens,
with different kinds of deprivation regiments,
and those studies,
which date back to the '60s,
are now being applied to human children.
One: provide care
to children who are currently
being deprived of treatment.
That's the humanitarian mission.
And the scientific mission would be
to test the limits
of visual plasticity.
And these two missions, as you can tell,
thread together perfectly. One adds to the other;
in fact, one would be impossible without the other.
So, to implement
these twin missions,
a few years ago, I launched Project Prakash.
Prakash, as many of you know,
is the Sanskrit word for light,
and the idea is that
in bringing light into the lives of children,
we also have a chance
of shedding light on some of the
deepest mysteries of neuroscience.
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish,
it's actually derived from
the Indian symbol of Diya, an earthen lamp.
The Prakash, the overall effort
has three components:
outreach, to identify children in need of care;
medical treatment; and in subsequent study.
And I want to show you a short video clip
that illustrates the first two components of this work.
conducted at a school for the blind.
many children have permanent conditions.
That's a case of microphthalmos,
which is malformed eyes,
and that's a permanent condition;
it cannot be treated.
That's an extreme of micropthalmos
called enophthalmos.
But, every so often, we come across children
who show some residual vision,
and that is a very good sign
that the condition might actually be treatable.
So, after that screening, we bring the children to the hospital.
That's the hospital we're working with in Delhi,
the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital.
It has a very well-equipped
pediatric ophthalmic center,
which was made possible in part
by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity.
So, eating burgers actually helps.
eye-health in many children, and ...
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash.)
you will see the cause of his blindness.
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils
are congenital cataracts,
so opacities of the lens.
In our eyes, the lens is clear,
but in this child, the lens has become opaque,
and therefore he can't see the world.
So, the child is given treatment. You'll see shots of the eye.
Here's the eye with the opaque lens,
the opaque lens extracted
and an acrylic lens inserted.
And here's the same child
three weeks post-operation,
with the right eye open.
that recovery is possible,
and we have now
provided treatment to over 200 children,
and the story repeats itself.
After treatment, the child
gains significant functionality.
In fact, the story holds true
even if you have a person who got sight
after several years of deprivation.
We did a paper a few years ago
about this woman that you see on the right, SRD,
and she got her sight late in life,
and her vision is remarkable at this age.
I should add a tragic postscript to this --
she died two years ago
in a bus accident.
So, hers is just a truly inspiring story --
unknown, but inspiring story.
So when we started finding these results,
as you might imagine, it created quite a bit of stir
in the scientific and the popular press.
Here's an article in Nature
that profiled this work,
and another one in Time.
So, we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced --
that recovery is feasible,
despite extended visual deprivation.
What is the process of recovery?
So, the way we study that is,
and I want to stress that the treatment
is completely unconditional;
there is no quid pro quo.
We treat many more children then we actually work with.
Every child who needs treatment is treated.
After treatment, about every week,
we run the child
on a battery of simple visual tests
And we try to do this for as long as possible.
This arc of development
gives us unprecedented
and extremely valuable information
What might be the causal connections
between the early developing skills
and the later developing ones?
many different visual proficiencies,
and that is image parsing into objects.
So, any image of the kind that you see on the left,
be it a real image or a synthetic image,
it's made up of little regions
that you see in the middle column,
regions of different colors, different luminances.
The brain has this complex task
of putting together, integrating,
subsets of these regions
into something that's more meaningful,
very soon after the onset of sight.
Here's a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago,
and you see Ethan Myers, a graduate student from MIT,
running the experiment with him.
but you get a general sense
of what are the regions that he's trying to trace out.
If you show him real world images,
if you show others like him real world images,
they are unable to recognize most of the objects
it's made up of a collage, a patchwork,
of regions of different colors and luminances.
So the world is this complex
patchwork of regions.
Even the shadow on the ball
becomes its own object.
Interestingly enough,
you give them a few months,
This one is a circle,
and this
is a square.
And the question is:
What underlies this transformation?
It's a profound question,
and what's even more amazing is how simple
the answer is.
The answer lies in motion
and that's what I want to show you in the next clip.
Now, how many things are these?
The one thing the visual system needs
in order to begin parsing the world
is dynamic information.
So the inference we are deriving from this,
and several such experiments,
is that dynamic information processing,
or motion processing,
serves as the bedrock for building
the rest of the complexity of visual processing;
it leads to visual integration
and eventually to recognition.
And let me just quickly mention two,
one, drawing from the domain of engineering,
and one from the clinic.
So, from the perspective of engineering,
we can ask: Goven that we know
for constructing machine-based vision systems
that can learn on their own, that don't need to be programmed
by a human programmer?
And that's what we're trying to do.
whatever basic knowledge you gain.
So we are creating Dylan,
which is a computational system
with an ambitious goal
of taking in visual inputs
of the same kind that a human child would receive,
and autonomously discovering:
What are the objects in this visual input?
how we test Dylan.
The way we test Dylan is by giving it
inputs, as I said, of the same kind
So, I thought,
could we have Darius
serve as our babycam carrier,
and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan?
So that's what we did.
I had to have long conversations with my wife.
in order to mimic the baby's visual acuity.
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20/20;
babies' acuity is like 20/800,
Here's what a baby-cam video looks like.
to go with this.
What's amazing is that working with such
highly degraded input,
the baby, very quickly, is able
to discover meaning in such input.
But then two or three days afterward,
babies begin to pay attention
to their mother's or their father's face.
How does that happen? We want Dylan to be able to do that,
Dylan actually can do that.
So, given that kind of video input,
with just about six or seven minutes worth of video,
Dylan can begin to extract patterns
that include faces.
So, it's an important demonstration
of the power of motion.
be the manifestation of something underneath,
of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism?
it would have massive repercussions in our understanding
of what's causing the many different aspects
of the autism phenotype.
video clips of two children -- one neurotypical,
one with autism, playing Pong.
So, while the child is playing Pong, we are tracking where they're looking.
In red are the eye movement traces.
This is the neurotypical child, and what you see
the child is already looking there.
the child always follows where the ball has been.
seems to be significantly compromised in autism.
more results to report soon.
we've treated so far,
this is the magnitude of the problem.
The red dots are the children we have not treated.
The Prakash Center for Children,
which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital,
a school for the children we are treating
and also a cutting-edge research facility.
The Prakash Center will integrate health care,
education and research in a way
that truly creates the whole
to be greater than the sum of the parts.
it's had an impact in multiple areas,
ranging from basic neuroscience
the development of autonomous machine vision systems,
education of the undergraduate and graduate students,
and most importantly in the alleviation
of childhood blindness.
And for my students and I, it's been
just a phenomenal experience
while at the same time
helping the many children that we have worked with.
Autism is a very big continuum
that goes from very severe -- the child remains nonverbal --
all the way up to brilliant scientists and engineers.
And I actually feel at home here,
I'm really concerned that a lot of the schools
those are the classes where I excelled.
I noticed a lot of little things that most people don't notice
would make the cattle balk.
For example, this flag waving right in front of the veterinary facility.
A chain hanging down ...
And that's shown very, very nicely in the movie.
And, actually, it's called "Temple Grandin,"
not "Thinking in Pictures."
Like if I say, "Think about a church steeple,"
I see only specific pictures.
They flash up into my memory, just like Google for pictures.
OK, how about famous ones?
Just really quickly, like Google for pictures.
And they come up one at a time,
and I can hold it there and turn them into videos.
in my work designing cattle-handling facilities.
Another thing that helped me as a little kid
drawing in perspective.
Now, I had this brain scan done several years ago,
going deep into my visual cortex.
This is tensor imaging.
The red lines there are me,
and the blue lines are the sex and age-matched control.
that people on the spectrum actually think with the primary visual cortex.
Now, the thing is, the visual thinker is just one kind of mind.
And where I was bad was algebra.
And I was never allowed to take geometry or trig.
no scotch tape, no cuts.
And there in the background is the pattern for folding it.
Here are the types of thinking:
photo-realistic visual thinkers, like me;
You'll see these different kinds of minds.
And I came in half an hour beforehand
into the animal mind.
Think about how much information there is on the local fire hydrant.
and a man on the ground --
You have another horse, where maybe the horseshoer beat him up,
I find a lot of people are not very good at this.
People have a hard time figuring that out.
solving problems with making airlines safer.
Yeah, I'm a million-mile flier.
I do lots and lots of flying,
and if I was at the FAA,
what would I be doing a lot of direct observation of?
It's tails, pure and simple.
And when the pilots walk around the plane, guess what?
They can't see that stuff inside the tail.
Now as I think about that,
I'm pulling up all of that specific information.
I take all the little pieces and I put the pieces together like a puzzle.
He'd been abused by somebody with a black cowboy hat.
White cowboy hats, that was absolutely fine.
We've got to work on developing all these different kinds of minds.
And one of the things that is driving me really crazy
as I travel around and I do autism meetings,
My science teacher is shown absolutely beautifully in the movie.
until I had Mr. Carlock's science class.
He was now Dr. Carlock in the movie.
to be more of a thinking and cognitive mind,
or your mind can be wired to be more social.
And what some of the research now has shown in autism
And then you can get to the point where it's so severe,
you're going to have a person that's going to be non-verbal.
In the normal human mind,
And the dementia ate out the language parts of the brain.
to show that this eddy pattern in this painting
followed a statistical model of turbulence,
because I think that's going to go on in my autism lectures.
We've got to show these kids interesting stuff.
these kinds of people in the future.
And let's talk about jobs.
OK, my science teacher got me studying,
because I was a goofball that didn't want to study.
But you know what? I was getting work experience.
I did internships in college,
I was building things,
and I also had to learn how to do assignments.
They can do graphic design, all kinds of stuff with computers,
And then you've got the word minds; they make great journalists,
and they also make really, really good stage actors.
Because the thing about being autistic is,
I had to learn social skills like being in a play.
You just kind of ... you just have to learn it.
And this brings up mentors.
You know, my science teacher was not an accredited teacher.
He was a NASA space scientist.
the good teachers, for a lot of these kids,
are out in the community colleges.
But we need to be getting some of these good teachers
You're getting that kid turned on.
And you get him turned on, then you'll learn all the new stuff.
And we've got to mentor them, hire them.
and it has to do some specific thing,
and it can only use so much memory."
That's the kind of specificity you need.
You know, you once wrote -- I like this quote:
then men would still be socializing in front of a wood fire
and if you were to get rid of all the autism genetics,
The thing is, autism comes in different degrees.
I got social interaction through shared interests --
I rode horses with other kids, I made model rockets with other kids,
did electronics lab with other kids.
where you just measure outcomes:
You directly observe a few simple things.
It's worked really well.
We need a lot more of that, and a lot less abstract stuff.
It's libraries.
And that might seem a bit surprising,
But energy and climate are extremely important to these people;
Really advanced civilization is based on advances in energy.
and that's why we have refrigerators, air-conditioning;
we can make modern materials and do so many things.
we need to meet a new constraint,
If you sum up the CO2 that gets emitted,
and that temperature increase leads to some very negative effects:
there's some uncertainty there, but not very much.
Can't we just cut it in half or a quarter?
And the answer is, until we get near to zero,
the temperature will continue to rise.
And so that's a big challenge.
over 26 billion tons.
For people in poor countries, it's less than one ton.
It's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet.
Probably, one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero.
The world today has 6.8 billion people.
That's headed up to about nine billion.
Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines,
But there, we see an increase of about 1.3.
This encompasses everything:
the food we eat, clothing, TV, heating.
In the rich world, perhaps the top one billion,
Here we have a very basic service:
here, finally we have some good news.
We have something that's not going up.
Through various inventions and new ways of doing lighting,
through different types of cars, different ways of building buildings --
Some individual services even bring it down by 90 percent.
we've gone from 26 billion to, at best, maybe 13 billion tons,
and that just won't cut it.
and this is the amount of CO2 put out per each unit of energy.
So the question is: Can you actually get that to zero?
Almost every way we make electricity today,
except for the emerging renewables and nuclear, puts out CO2.
So we need energy miracles.
The Internet and its services are a miracle.
Usually, we don't have a deadline
where you have to get the miracle by a certain date.
Usually, you just kind of stand by, and some come along, some don't.
This is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed
I thought back to a year ago when I brought mosquitoes,
I decided that releasing fireflies
would be my contribution to the environment here this year.
So here we have some natural fireflies.
but they don't really add up to much.
We need solutions, either one or several,
And although there's many directions that people are seeking,
Those may make some contribution,
and we can't give up any of them because they look daunting,
pressurize it, create a liquid, put it somewhere,
and hope it stays there.
but the toughest one here is this long-term issue:
than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things?
This is a lot of volume.
So that's a tough one.
It also has three big problems:
cost, particularly in highly regulated countries, is high;
And then what do you do with the waste?
and so, should be worked on.
And they actually -- although it's great they don't require fuel --
they have some disadvantages.
One is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies
is dramatically less than a power plant.
Also, these are intermittent sources.
And so, if you depend on these sources,
you have to have some way of getting the energy
during those time periods that it's not available.
So we've got big cost challenges here.
We have transmission challenges;
for cars, for computers, for phones, for flashlights, for everything --
and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses.
What I found is that all the batteries we make now
And so, in fact, we need a big breakthrough here,
something that's going to be a factor of 100 better
than the approaches we have now.
It's not impossible, but it's not a very easy thing.
Now, this shows up when you try to get the intermittent source
to be above, say, 20 to 30 percent of what you're using.
Well, we need lots of companies working on this -- hundreds.
that are doing great things and have interesting possibilities,
and I'm trying to help back that.
Nathan Myhrvold and I actually are backing a company
that, perhaps surprisingly, is actually taking the nuclear approach.
There are some innovations in nuclear: modular, liquid.
Innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago,
the one percent, which is the U235 --
It is kind of a crazy idea.
In fact, people had talked about it for a long time,
but they could never simulate properly whether it would work or not,
and so it's through the advent of modern supercomputers
that now you can simulate and see that, yes,
you have greatly improved cost profile.
It breeds this uranium as it goes along, so it's kind of like a candle.
You see it's a log there, often referred to as a traveling wave reactor.
I've got a picture here of a place in Kentucky.
That would power the US for hundreds of years.
So let's think: How should we measure ourselves?
What should our report card look like?
Well, let's go out to where we really need to get,
and then look at the intermediate.
For 2050, you've heard many people talk about this 80 percent reduction.
And that 20 percent will be used up by things going on in poor countries --
So, to get to that 80 percent,
the developed countries, including countries like China,
will have had to switch their electricity generation altogether.
The other grade is: Are we deploying this zero-emission technology,
have we deployed it in all the developed countries
and are in the process of getting it elsewhere?
That's super important.
Well, again, it should have the two elements.
We should go through these efficiency measures to start getting reductions:
pilot projects, regulatory things that have been changed.
There's a lot that has to come together.
It's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology.
If you gave me only one wish for the next 50 years --
I could pick who's president,
I could pick a vaccine, which is something I love,
or I could pick that this thing
that's half the cost with no CO2 gets invented --
this is the wish I would pick.
This is the one with the greatest impact.
If we don't get this wish,
between the US and China, between poor countries and rich,
What am I appealing to you to step forward and drive?
We need to go for more research funding.
on these innovative approaches.
We do need the market incentives -- CO2 tax, cap and trade --
something that gets that price signal out there.
This is an important wish, but it is one I think we can achieve.
finding the several billion, finding the regulator, the location
that will actually build the first one of these.
Once you get the first one built, if it works as advertised,
and then the process starts at the top and kind of works down?
so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong,
where you're opening it up and moving things in and out --
that's not good.
just think of it as a log --
put it down and not have those same complexities.
and put it into another one and burn that.
And we start out, actually, by taking the waste that exists today
that's sitting in these cooling pools or dry-casking by reactors --
is actually what gets fed into ours,
and you're reducing the volume of the waste quite dramatically
as you're going through this process.
I've been back seeing the secretary of energy here,
talking about how this fits into the energy agenda.
It's an important advance, but it's like a fast reactor,
and a lot of countries have built them,
who, likewise, if their science goes well,
if the funding for their pilot plants goes well,
that they can compete for this.
And it's best if multiple succeed,
because then you could use a mix of these things.
We certainly need one to succeed.
is this the biggest that you're aware of out there?
In the nuclear space, there are other innovators.
You know, we don't know their work as well as we know this one,
but the beauty of this is a molecule of uranium
has a million times as much energy as a molecule of, say, coal.
to try and keep the temperature of the earth stable?
it's like if you've been overeating, and you're about to have a heart attack.
which are various techniques that would delay the heating
about: Should that be in the back pocket in case things happen faster,
The ones who make scientific arguments are very few.
Are they saying there's negative feedback effects
that have to do with clouds that offset things?
In fact, the IPCC report -- that's not necessarily the worst case,
The fact is it's that uncertain part that should move us towards this.
"OK, I don't care that it doesn't put out CO2,
I kind of wish it did put out CO2.
when there are better things we can do.
it's not that dramatic.
It shouldn't take away from other things.
The thing you get into big money on, and reasonable people can disagree,
is when you have something that's non-economic
If the trade-off you get into is, "Let's make energy super expensive,"
then the rich can afford that.
I mean, all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy
and not change our lifestyle.
The disaster is for that two billion.
His shtick now is, "Why isn't the R&D getting more discussed?"
but he's realized that's a pretty lonely camp,
The R&D piece -- it's crazy how little it's funded.
I've always been interested in
the relationship of formal structures and human behavior.
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.
Well, law is also a powerful driver
of human behavior.
And what I'd like to discuss today
is the need to overhaul and simplify the law
to release the energy and passion
of Americans, so that we can begin
to address the challenges of our society.
progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.
If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything
without calling your general counsel.
Indeed, there is this phenomenon now
where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.
It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.
You need a lawyer to run the company,
because there's so much law.
But it's not just business that's affected by this,
it's actually pressed down into the daily activities
of ordinary people.
It was in a grizzly bear preserve,
although no one told me that before we went.
And our guide was a local science teacher.
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,
but she was terrified of lawyers.
The stories started pouring out.
She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent
had threatened to sue the school
because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent
when he turned the paper in late.
The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent
because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.
So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made
over and over again.
After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated
and raised the grade.
She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."
in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,
and she was going to drive them in her car,
but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car
for liability reasons.
You have to go in a school bus."
So, they provided a bus that held 60 people
and drove the three of them back and forth
several hours to Laramie.
and he takes his biology class on a hike
in the nearby national park.
But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year
because one of the students in the class was disabled,
so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.
At the end of this day I could have filled a book
just with stories about law
from this one teacher.
is the foundation of freedom.
But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,
the land of the free has become a legal minefield.
It's really changed our lives in ways
that are sort of imperceptible;
and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a
pediatrician friend
in North Carolina. He said,
"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.
You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff
that might be used against you."
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.
My own law firm has a list of questions
that I'm not allowed to ask
when interviewing candidates,
such as the sinister question,
bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,
"Where are you from?"
(Laughter)
that lawsuits are out of control.
And we read every once in while
about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy
in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars
because they lost his pair of pants.
The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.
are relatively rare. They don't usually win.
And the total of direct tort cost
in this country is about two percent,
which is twice as much as in other countries
but, as taxes go, hardly crippling.
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.
almost without our knowing,
is our culture has changed.
People no longer feel free
to act on their best judgment.
So, what do we do about it?
We certainly don't want to give up the rights,
when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.
We need regulation to make sure
people don't pollute and such.
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with
this problem,
and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.
every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.
And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.
Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances
that explain why Johnny
turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?
Is it possible that the doctor
might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.
There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out
where it's possible that something could have been done differently.
hoping that we can judge any dispute
against the standard of a perfect society,
where everyone will agree what's fair,
and where accidents will be extinct,
risk will be no more.
Of course, this is Utopia;
it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.
It's not the basis of the rule of law,
it's not the basis of a free society.
So, now I have the first of four propositions
I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:
You've got to judge law mainly
by its effect on the broader society,
not individual disputes.
Absolutely vital.
and look at our society from high above.
Is it working?
What does the macro-data show us?
Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:
a culture pervaded with defensiveness,
universal distrust of the system of justice,
universal practice of defensive medicine.
It's very hard to measure
because there are mixed motives.
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,
and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.
But reliable estimates
range between 60 billion and
200 billion dollars per year.
That's enough to provide care to all the people
in America who don't have it.
makes doctors practice better medicine."
Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine
and others. Turns out that's not the case.
The fear has chilled professional interaction
so thousands of tragic errors occur
because doctors are afraid
to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"
Because they're not sure,
and they don't want to take legal responsibility.
As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,
she seems to be affected by the law.
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.
You could have a separate section of a law library
around each of the following legal concepts:
due process, special education,
no child left behind,
zero tolerance, work rules ...
it goes on. We did a study
of all the rules that affect one school
in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.
Tens of thousands of discreet rules,
60 steps to suspend a student from school:
It's a formula for paralysis.
What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.
it's directly attributable
to the rise of due process.
Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago
where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America
say that they spend at least half of their time
maintaining order in the classroom.
That means those students are getting half the learning
they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class
no one can learn.
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?
They're threatened with a legal claim.
We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers
in America have been threatened by their students
with violating their rights, with lawsuits
by their students. They are threatening, their students.
It's not that they usually sue,
it's not that they would win, but it's an
indication of the corrosion of authority.
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.
The other day at the State of the Union speech,
President Obama said,
and I think we could all agree with this goal,
"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,
our nation has always been the first to compete.
There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."
Well, actually there is a reason:
Environmental review has evolved into a process
of no pebble left unturned
for any major project taking the better part of a decade,
then followed by years of litigation
by anybody who doesn't like the project.
people are acting like idiots,
(Laughter)
all across the country.
(Applause)
Idiots. A couple of years ago,
Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.
(Laughter)
That means all the boys are going to be ADD.
I mean it's just absolutely
a formula for failure.
"Caution: Contents are hot,"
on billions of coffee cups.
Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years
and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,
but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.
That's the only explanation. Because why
would you have to tell people that something was actually hot?
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.
Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,
with a three pronged hook in the back,
and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."
(Laughter)
are doing what they think is right.
And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?
Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:
It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anything
and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --
and it's also too detailed.
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules
no human could possibly know it.
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes
trying to prune this legal jungle.
But the challenge here is not one of just
amending the law,
because the hurdle for success is trust.
people have to trust it.
So, that's my second proposition:
Trust is an essential condition
to a free society.
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,
because it carries with it the power of state.
And so the state can come in.
It actually changes the way people think.
It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders
all day long, whispering in your ear,
"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"
It drives people from the smart part of the brain --
that dark, deep well of the subconscious,
where instincts and experience,
and all the other factors of creativity
and good judgment are --
it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.
if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me
if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."
Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.
If you make people self-conscious
about their judgments, studies show
you will make them make worse judgments.
If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes
when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.
Edison stated it best. He said,
"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,
we're trying to accomplish something."
(Laughter)
Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,
and tort reform, which is a great idea,
lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,
but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.
States with extensive tort reform
still suffer all these pathologies.
So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,
but actually create a dry ground of freedom.
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.
And it is this:
Law sets boundaries,
and on one side of those boundaries are all the things
you can't do or must do --
you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --
but those same boundaries are supposed to define
and protect a dry ground of freedom.
"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,
within which men shall be inviolable."
We've forgotten that second part.
Those dikes have burst. People wade through law
all day long.
So, what's needed now
is to rebuild these boundaries.
And it's especially important to rebuild them
for lawsuits.
Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries
for everybody else's freedom.
If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"
it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,
all the seesaws will disappear.
Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.
And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,
merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,
nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,
because there's no risk associated with it.
Life is too complex for...
(Applause)
Life is too complex for a software program.
All these choices involve value judgments
and social norms, not objective facts.
And so here is the fourth proposition.
This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.
And there are two essential elements of it:
We have to simplify the law.
We have to migrate from all this complexity
towards general principles and goals.
The constitution is only 16 pages long.
Worked pretty well for 200 years.
so that people can internalize it
in their daily choices.
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.
And how do you make it simple?
Because life is complex,
and here is the hardest and biggest change:
We have to restore the authority
to judges and officials
to interpret and apply the law.
(Applause)
We have to rehumanize the law.
To make law simple so that you feel free,
the people in charge have to be free
to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law
in accord with reasonable social norms.
As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,
you have to think that if there is a dispute,
there's somebody in society who sees it as their job
to affirmatively protect you
if you're acting reasonably.
That person doesn't exist today.
It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.
Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court
for your lost pair of pants for $100,
but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.
Takes five minutes. That's it,
it's not that hard.
because we woke up in the 1960s
to all these really bad values: racism,
gender discrimination, pollution --
they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system
where no one could have bad values anymore.
The problem is, we created a system
where we eliminated the right to have good values.
It doesn't mean that people in authority
can do whatever they want.
They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:
The teacher is accountable to the principal,
the judge is accountable to an appellate court,
the president is accountable to voters.
But the accountability's up the line
judging the decision against the effect on everybody,
not just on the disgruntled person.
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.
(Applause)
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.
It's not true. Authority, in fact,
is essential to freedom.
Law is a human institution;
responsibility is a human institution.
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,
to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,
then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.
If the environmental agency can't decide
that the power lines are good for the environment,
then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms
to the city.
A free society requires red lights and green lights,
otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.
That's what's happened to America. Look around.
is to restore the authority to make common choices.
It's the only way to get our freedom back,
and it's the only way to release the energy and passion
needed so that we can meet the challenges
of our time. Thank you.
(Applause)
not just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense,
What is this stuff?
What is the significance?
It was in 1829,
and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum --
and he called it "Technology."
And that's the very first use of the word.
It actually goes way back,
and what I want to suggest is, it goes a long way back.
we, as a species, would not live very long.
We would die by the billions, and very quickly:
the wolves would get us, we would be defenseless,
So, they had minimal technology,
but they had some technology.
And if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes
and the Neanderthal, which are very similar to early man,
we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology,
and this is a kind of a curve of their average age.
because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.
So that's one aspect.
with that very little technology,
actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food they needed:
three to six hours a day.
So it was possible to get enough food.
But when the scarcity came,
And that's why they didn't live very long.
even something as small as this --
in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise.
Our bodies have adapted to these new diets.
Our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.
and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet.
until, within several tens of thousands of years,
Even during the agricultural age, there was climate change.
In fact, our humanity and everything that we think about ourselves,
is something we've invented.
It's a very, very strong force.
we call that the technium.
into life, into us.
an information process that was restructuring
You put energy into the right kind of system,
and out comes wasted heat, entropy,
It's the increased order.
Stars are basically nuclear fission machines
that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years:
and technology is basically an extension of life.
The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence.
And the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life
is actually greater than a star --
because of the star's long lifespan,
There is more energy flowing through, per gram per second,
than anything that we have any other experience with.
That's where technology is going.
Things in life start off being general cells,
and they become specialized:
you have tissue cells, muscle, brain cells.
The same thing happens with, say, a hammer,
which is general at first and becomes more specific.
So I would like to say that while there are six kingdoms of life,
It's a branching off from the human form.
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.
and what it gives us is basically progress.
if we discount the cost of that.
he had 18,000 things in his house,
King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,
and he could buy refrigeration.
When you meet a new technology, stop,
You try it out.
You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests,
not just once, but eternally.
And when it diverts from what you want,
we find a new job for it.
is a better idea.
But DDT sprayed on local homes --
there's nothing better to eliminate malaria,
besides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets.
But that's a really good idea; that's a good job for technology.
to find them good friends,
looking for the right job.
That's actually my son, right here.
just as there are no bad children.
and the evolution of life, the evolution of brains --
we pay a price for that, but we're aware of it,
Because technology is an extension of life,
So that I think technology loves biology,
if we allow it to.
Great movement starting billions of years ago
Does anybody know when the stethoscope was invented?
Any guesses? 1816.
And what I can say is, in 2016,
doctors aren't going to be walking around with stethoscopes.
There's a whole lot better technology coming,
and that's part of the change in medicine.
has been wireless devices.
But the future are digital medical wireless devices, OK?
to kind of make this much more concrete.
This is the first one. This is an electrocardiogram.
And, as a cardiologist, to think that you could see in real time
a patient, an individual, anywhere in the world
on your smartphone,
and it's with us today.
You check your email while you're sitting here.
In the future you're going to be checking all your vital signs,
all your vital signs: your heart rhythm,
your blood pressure, your oxygen, your temperature, etc.
This is already available today.
It's now wired -- or I should say, wireless --
by taking the aggregate of these signals
in the hospital, in the intensive care unit,
and putting it on a smartphone for physicians.
If you're an expectant parent,
what about the ability to monitor, continuously,
fetal heart rate, or intrauterine contractions,
and not having to worry so much that things are
fine as the pregnancy,
and moving over into the time of delivery?
Right now, they are under the skin,
but in the future, they won't have to be implanted.
checking it every five minutes in a continuous glucose sensor --
We're going to zoom in on that a little bit.
We're supposed to spend a third of our life in sleep.
What if, on your phone,
which will be available in the next few weeks,
you had every minute of your sleep displayed?
And this is, of course, as you can see, the awake is the orange.
The REM sleep, rapid eye movement,
dream state, is in light green;
and light is gray, light sleep;
and deep sleep, the best restorative sleep,
is that dark green.
And this is ability, in real time, to actually take
measurements of caloric intake
as well as expenditure, through a Band-Aid.
But what I want to get to, the next frontier,
very quickly, and why the stethoscope
is on its way out,
is because we can transcend listening to the valve sounds,
and the breath sounds, because now,
introduced by G.E. is a handheld ultra-sound.
Why is this important? Because this is so much more sensitive.
Here is an example of an abdominal ultrasound,
and also a cardiac echo, which can be sent wireless,
and then there's an example of fetal monitoring on your smartphone.
the key measurements of vital signs,
and all those things in physiology -- but also all the imaging
that one could look at in your smartphone.
Now, this is an example of another obsolete technology,
soon to be buried: the Holter Monitor.
Twenty-four hour recording, lots of wires.
This is now a little tiny patch.
You can put it on for two weeks
and send it in the mail.
there is these smart Band-Aids or these sensors
that one would put on, on a shoe or on the wrist.
And this sends a signal
and it creates a body area network to a gateway.
Gateway could be a smartphone or it could be a dedicated gateway,
That signal goes to the web, the cloud,
and then it can be processed and sent anywhere:
to a caregiver, to a physician,
back to the patient, etc.
So, that's basically very simplistic technology
of how this works.
as you saw already,
but it also goes well beyond that.
This is me now. And you can see the ECG.
Below that's the actual heart rate and the trend;
to the right of that is a bioconductant.
That's the fluid status,
fluid status, that's really important
if you're monitoring somebody with heart failure.
And below that's temperature,
and respiration, and oxygen,
and then the position activity.
So, this is really striking, because this device
measures seven things
that are very much vital signs
for monitoring someone with heart failure. OK?
this is the most expensive bed.
What if we could reduce the need for hospital beds?
Well, we can. First of all, heart failure
is the number one reason
for hospital admissions and readmissions in this country.
The cost of heart failure is 37 billion dollars a year,
which is 80 percent related to hospitalization.
And in the course of 30 days after a hospital stay
for a Medicare greater than 65 years or older,
is -- 27 percent are readmitted in 30 days,
and by six months, over 56 percent are readmitted.
So, can we improve that? Well the idea is
we take this device that I'm wearing,
and we put it on 600 patients with heart failure,
randomly assigned, versus 600 patients
who don't have active monitoring,
and see whether we can reduce heart failure readmissions,
and that's exciting. And we'll start that trial,
and you'll hear more about how we're going to do that,
but that's a type of wireless device trial
that could change medicine in the years ahead.
a reality, an exciting direction in the future of medicine?
What we have is, in a way, a perfect positive storm.
This sets up consumer-driven healthcare.
That's where this is all starting.
Let me just give you specifics about why this is
a big movement if you're not aware of it:
1.2 million Americans
have gotten a Nike shoe, which is a body-area network
that connects the shoe, the sole of the shoe to the iPhone, or an iPod.
And this Wired Magazine cover article
really captured a lot of this; it talked a lot about the Nike shoe
and how quickly that's been adopted to monitor exercise physiology
and energy expenditure.
Here are some things, the principles
that are guiding principles to keep in mind:
"A data-driven health revolution
promises to make us all
better, faster, and stronger. Living by numbers."
And this one, which is really telling,
this was from July, this cover article:
diet and exercise. It's about tracking every facet
of life, from sleep to mood to pain,
24/7/365."
Well, I tried this device.
A lot of you have gotten that Phillips Direct Life.
I didn't have one of those,
but I got the Fitbit.
That looks like this.
It's like a wireless accelerometer, pedometer.
And I want to just give you the results of that testing,
because I wanted to understand about the consumer movement.
I hope the, by the way, the Phillips Direct Life works better --
I hope so.
But this monitors food, it monitors activity and tracks weight.
However you have to put in most of this stuff.
The only thing it really tracks by itself is activity,
and even then, it's not complete.
So, you exercise and it picks up the exercise.
You put in your height and weight, it calculates BMI,
and of course it tells you how many calories you're expending
from the exercise, and how many you took in,
And so I went to this,
and of course I was gratified that it picked up
the 42 minutes of exercise, elliptical exercise I did,
but then it wants more information.
So, it says, "You want to log sexual activity.
How long did you do it for?"
(Laughter)
Now, this doesn't appear -- this just doesn't work,
This is the headband that goes with this alarm clock.
This is an important part of our life, one-third you're supposed to be sleeping.
have any problems with sleeping?
It's usually 90 percent. So, you tell me you sleep better than expected.
Okay, well this was a week of
my life in sleeping,
and you get a Z.Q. score. Instead of an I.Q. score,
you get a Z.Q. score when you wake up.
You say, "Oh, OK." And a Z.Q. score
is adjusted to age,
and you want to get as high as you possibly can.
So this is the moment-by-moment,
or minute-by-minute sleep.
And you see that Z.Q. there was 80-odd.
And the wake time is in orange.
And this can be a problem, as I learned.
Because it not only helps you with quantifying
your sleep,
but also tells others you're awake.
So, when my wife came in and she
could tell you're awake.
"Eric, I want to talk. I want to talk."
And I'm trying to play possum.
This thing is very, very impressive.
And this one is now 67,
and that's not a good score.
And this tells you, of course, how much you had in REM sleep,
in deep sleep, and all this sort of thing.
This was really fascinating because
this gave that quantitation
about all the different phases of sleep.
So, it also then tells you how you do compared to your age group.
It's like a managed competition of sleep.
And really interesting stuff.
Look at this thing and say, "Well, I didn't think I was a very good sleeper,
but actually I did better than average in 50 to 60 year olds." OK?
And the key thing was, what I didn't know,
was that I was a really good dreamer.
Eighty percent of Americans have chronic disease,
or 80 percent of age greater than 65 have
two or more chronic disease,
140 million Americans
have one or more chronic disease,
and 80 percent of our 1.5, whatever, trillion
expenditures are related to chronic disease.
Now, diabetes is one of the big ones.
Almost 24 million people have diabetes.
And here is the latest map. It was published
just a little more than a week ago in the New York Times,
and it isn't looking good.
That is, for men, 29 percent
in the country over 60 have Type II diabetes,
and women, although it's less, it's terribly high.
on a continuous basis,
with a sensor that detects blood glucose,
and it's important because we could detect
hyperglycemia that otherwise wouldn't be known,
and also hypoglycemia.
And you can see the red dots, in this particular patient's case,
were finger sticks, which would have missed both ends.
it captures all that vital information.
The future of this though,
is being able to move this to a Band-Aid type phenomenon,
and that's not so far away.
So, let me just give you, very quickly,
10 top targets for wireless medicine.
All these things are possible --
some of them are very close,
or already, as you heard,
are available today, in some way or form.
there's five million people affected, and you can check
vital signs, activity, balance.
Asthma: large number, we could detect things like
pollen count, air quality, respiratory rate. Breast cancer,
I'll show you an example of that real quickly.
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
Depression, there's a great approach to that in mood disorders.
Diabetes I've just mentioned. Heart failure we already talked about. Hypertension:
74 million people could have continuous blood-pressure monitoring
to come up with much better management and prevention.
And obesity we already talked about, the ways to get to that.
And sleep disorders.
and cell phones today is extraordinary.
And this article from The Economist summed it up beautifully
about the opportunities in health across the developing world:
"Mobile phones made a bigger difference to the lives of more people,
more quickly, than any previous technology."
And that's before we got going on the m-health world.
Aging: The problem is enormous,
300,000 broken hips per year;
but the solutions are extraordinary,
and they include so many different things.
The iShoe is another example of a sensor that
improves proprioception among the elderly
to prevent falling.
One of many different techniques using wireless sensors.
So, we can change medicine across the continuum of care,
across the ages from premies or unborn children
to seniors; the pharmaceutical arena changes;
the full spectrum of disease -- I hope I've given you a sense of that --
across the globe.
One of them -- we're very fortunate -- is to develop a dedicated institute
and that's work that started with the work that Scripps with Qualcomm ...
and then the great fortune of meeting up with Gary and Mary West,
to get behind this wireless health institute.
San Diego is an extraordinary place for this.
There's over 650 wireless companies,
100 of which or more are working in wireless health.
It's the number one source of commerce, and interestingly
it dovetails beautifully with over 500 life science companies.
the West Wireless Health Institute,
is really the outgrowth of two extraordinary people
who are here this evening:
Gary and Mary West. And I'd like to give it up for them for getting behind this.
(Applause)
Their fantastic philanthropic investment made this possible,
and this is really a nonprofit education center
which is just about to open. It looks like this,
this whole building dedicated.
And what it's trying to do is accelerate this era:
to take unmet medical needs, to work and innovate --
and we just appointed the chief engineer, Mehran Mehregany,
it was announced on Monday --
then to move up with development,
clinical trial validation and then changing medical practice,
the most challenging thing of all,
requiring attention to reimbursement, healthcare policy, healthcare economics.
institute to catalyze this process
is guidance,
and that's of course relying on the fact that medicine goes digital.
If we understand biology from genomics and omics
and wireless through physiologic phenotyping, that's big.
Because what it does is allow a convergence like we've never had before.
Over 80 major diseases have been cracked at the genomic level,
but this is quite extraordinary: More has been learned about
the underpinnings of disease in the last two and a half years
than in the history of man.
And when you put that together with, for example,
now an app for the iPhone with your genotype
to guide drug therapy ...
but, the future -- we can now tell who's going to get Type II diabetes
from all the common variants,
and that's going to get filled in more
with low-frequency variants in the future.
We can tell who's going to get breast cancer
from the various genes.
We can also know who's likely to get atrial fibrillation.
Each of these has a sensor.
We can give glucose a sensor for diabetes to prevent it.
We can prevent, or have the earliest detection possible,
for breast cancer with an ultrasound device
given to the patient.
An iPatch, iRhythm, for atrial fibrillation.
And vital-signs monitoring to prevent sudden cardiac death.
We lose 700,000 people a year in the U.S. from sudden cardiac death.
of the impact on hospital clinic resources is profound
and then the impact on diseases is equally impressive
across all these different diseases and more.
It's really taking individualized medicine to a new height
and it's hyper-innovative,
and I think it represents the black swan of medicine.
Thanks for your attention.
I am going to speak about corruption,
but I would like to juxtapose
two different things.
One is the large global economy,
the large globalized economy,
and the other one is the small, and very limited,
capacity of our traditional governments
and their international institutions
to govern, to shape, this economy.
Because there is this asymmetry,
which creates, basically,
failing governance.
Failing governance in many areas:
in the area of corruption and the area of destruction of the environment,
in the area of exploitation of women and children,
in the area of climate change,
in all the areas in which we really need
a capacity to reintroduce
the primacy of politics
into the economy,
which is operating in a worldwide arena.
And I think corruption,
and the fight against corruption,
and the impact of corruption,
is probably one of the most interesting ways
to illustrate what I mean
with this failure of governance.
I used to work as the director
of the World Bank office in Nairobi
for East Africa.
At that time, I noticed
that corruption, that grand corruption,
that systematic corruption,
was undermining everything we were trying to do.
And therefore, I began
to not only try to protect
the work of the World Bank,
our own projects, our own programs
against corruption,
but in general, I thought, "We need a system
to protect the people
in this part of the world
from the ravages of corruption."
And as soon as I started this work,
I received a memorandum from the World Bank,
from the legal department first,
in which they said, "You are not allowed to do this.
You are meddling in the internal affairs of our partner countries.
This is forbidden by the charter of the World Bank,
so I want you to stop your doings."
donor meetings, for instance,
in which the various donors,
and many of them like to be in Nairobi --
it is true, it is one of the
unsafest cities of the world,
but they like to be there because the other cities
are even less comfortable.
And in these donor meetings, I noticed
that many of the worst projects --
which were put forward
by our clients, by the governments,
by promoters,
many of them representing
suppliers from the North --
that the worst projects
were realized first.
Let me give you an example:
a huge power project,
300 million dollars,
to be built smack into
one of the most vulnerable, and one of the most beautiful,
areas of western Kenya.
And we all noticed immediately
that this project had no economic benefits:
It had no clients, nobody would buy the electricity there,
nobody was interested in irrigation projects.
To the contrary, we knew that this project
would destroy the environment:
It would destroy riparian forests,
which were the basis for
the survival of nomadic groups,
the Samburu and the Turkana in this area.
So everybody knew this is a, not a useless project,
this is an absolute damaging, a terrible project --
not to speak about the future indebtedness of the country
for these hundreds of millions of dollars,
and the siphoning off
of the scarce resources of the economy
from much more important activities
like schools, like hospitals and so on.
And yet, we all rejected this project,
none of the donors was willing
to have their name connected with it,
and it was the first project to be implemented.
would take under our wings,
they took years, you know,
you had too many studies,
and very often they didn't succeed.
But these bad projects,
which were absolutely damaging -- for the economy
for many generations, for the environment,
for thousands of families who had to be resettled --
they were suddenly put together
by consortia of banks,
of supplier agencies,
of insurance agencies --
like in Germany, Hermes, and so on --
and they came back very, very quickly,
driven by an unholy alliance
between the powerful elites
in the countries there
and the suppliers from the North.
Now, these suppliers
were our big companies.
They were the actors of this global market,
which I mentioned in the beginning.
They were the Siemenses of this world,
coming from France, from the UK, from Japan,
from Canada, from Germany,
and they were systematically driven
by systematic, large-scale corruption.
We are not talking about
50,000 dollars here,
or 100,000 dollars there, or one million dollars there.
No, we are talking about 10 million, 20 million dollars
on the Swiss bank accounts,
on the bank accounts of Liechtenstein,
of the president's ministers,
the high officials in the para-statal sectors.
and not only one project like that:
I saw, I would say,
over the years I worked in Africa,
I saw hundreds of projects like this.
And so, I became convinced
that it is this systematic corruption
which is perverting economic policy-making in these countries,
which is the main reason
for the misery, for the poverty,
for the conflicts, for the violence,
for the desperation
in many of these countries.
That we have today
more than a billion people below the absolute poverty line,
that we have more than a billion people
without proper drinking water in the world,
twice that number,
more than two billion people
without sanitation and so on,
and the consequent illnesses
of mothers and children,
still, child mortality of more than
10 million people every year,
children dying before they are five years old:
The cause of this is, to a large extent,
grand corruption.
not let me do this work?
I found out afterwards,
after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank.
The reason was that the members of the World Bank
thought that foreign bribery was okay,
including Germany.
In Germany, foreign bribery was allowed.
It was even tax-deductible.
No wonder that most of the most important
international operators in Germany,
but also in France and the UK
and Scandinavia, everywhere, systematically bribed.
Not all of them, but most of them.
And this is the phenomenon
which I call failing governance,
because when I then came to Germany
and started this little NGO
here in Berlin, at the Villa Borsig,
we were told, "You cannot stop
our German exporters from bribing,
because we will lose our contracts.
We will lose to the French,
we will lose to the Swedes, we'll lose to the Japanese."
And therefore, there was a indeed a prisoner's dilemma,
which made it very difficult
for an individual company,
an individual exporting country
to say, "We are not going to
continue this deadly, disastrous
habit of large companies to bribe."
with a failing governance structure,
because even the powerful government,
which we have in Germany, comparatively,
was not able to say,
"We will not allow our companies to bribe abroad."
They needed help,
and the large companies themselves
have this dilemma.
Many of them didn't want to bribe.
Many of the German companies, for instance,
believe that they are really
producing a high-quality product
at a good price, so they are very competitive.
They are not as good at bribing
as many of their international competitors are,
but they were not allowed
to show their strengths,
because the world was eaten up
by grand corruption.
Civil society rose to the occasion.
We had this small NGO,
Transparency International.
They began to think of
an escape route from this prisoner's dilemma,
and we developed concepts
of collective action,
basically trying to bring various competitors
together around the table,
explaining to all of them
how much it would be in their interests
if they simultaneously would stop bribing,
and to make a long story short,
we managed to eventually
get Germany to sign
together with the other OECD countries
and a few other exporters.
under the auspices of the OECD,
which obliged everybody
to change their laws
and criminalize foreign bribery.
(Applause)
Well, thank you. I mean, it's interesting,
in doing this,
we had to sit together with the companies.
We had here in Berlin, at the Aspen Institute on the Wannsee,
we had sessions with about
20 captains of industry,
and we discussed with them
what to do about international bribery.
In the first session -- we had three sessions
over the course of two years.
And President von Weizsäcker, by the way,
chaired one of the sessions, the first one,
to take the fear away
from the entrepreneurs,
who were not used to deal
with non-governmental organizations.
And in the first session, they all said,
"This is not bribery, what we are doing." This is customary there.
This is what these other cultures demand.
They even applaud it.
In fact, [unclear]
still says this today.
And so there are still a lot of people
who are not convinced that you have to stop bribing.
But in the second session,
they admitted already that they would never do this,
what they are doing in these other countries,
here in Germany, or in the U.K., and so on.
Cabinet ministers would admit this.
And in the final session, at the Aspen Institute,
we had them all sign an open letter
to the Kohl government, at the time,
requesting that they
participate in the OECD convention.
an example of soft power,
because we were able to convince them
that they had to go with us.
We had a longer-term time perspective.
We had a broader,
geographically much wider,
constituency we were trying to defend.
And that's why the law has changed.
That's why Siemens is now in the trouble they are in
and that's why MIN is in the trouble they are in.
In some other countries, the OECD convention
is not yet properly enforced.
And, again, civil societies
breathing down the neck of the establishment.
where the BAE got away
with a huge corruption case,
which the Serious Fraud Office tried to prosecute,
100 million British pounds,
every year for ten years,
to one particular official of one particular friendly country,
who then bought for
44 billion pounds of military equipment.
This case, they are not prosecuting in the UK.
Why? Because they consider this
as contrary to the security interest
of the people of Great Britain.
Civil society is pushing, civil society
is trying to get a solution to this problem,
also in the U.K.,
and also in Japan, which is not properly enforcing,
and so on.
the ratification of the UN convention,
which is a subsequent convention.
We are, Germany, is not ratifying.
Why? Because it would make it necessary
to criminalize the corruption
of deputies.
In Germany, we have a system where
you are not allowed to bribe a civil servant,
but you are allowed to bribe a deputy.
This is, under German law, allowed,
and the members of our parliament don't want to change this,
and this is why they can't sign
the U.N. convention against foreign bribery --
one of they very, very few countries
which is preaching honesty and good governance everywhere in the world,
but not able to ratify the convention,
which we managed to get on the books
with about 160 countries all over the world.
Let me just try to
draw some conclusions from what has happened.
I believe that what we managed to achieve
in fighting corruption,
one can also achieve
in other areas of failing governance.
By now, the United Nations
is totally on our side.
The World Bank has turned from Saulus to Paulus; under Wolfensohn,
they became, I would say, the strongest
anti-corruption agency in the world.
Most of the large companies
are now totally convinced
that they have to put in place
very strong policies
against bribery and so on.
And this is possible because civil society
joined the companies
and joined the government
in the analysis of the problem,
in the development of remedies,
in the implementation of reforms,
and then later, in the monitoring of reforms.
want to play that role,
they have to grow into this responsibility.
Not all civil society organizations are good.
The Ku Klux Klan is an NGO.
So, we must be aware
that civil society
has to shape up itself.
They have to have a much more
transparent financial governance.
They have to have a much more participatory governance
in many civil society organizations.
We also need much more competence of civil society leaders.
This is why we have set up the governance school
and the Center for Civil Society here in Berlin,
because we believe most of our educational
and research institutions in Germany
and continental Europe in general,
do not focus enough, yet,
on empowering civil society
and training the leadership of civil society.
If civil society does it right
and joins the other actors --
in particular, governments,
governments and their international institutions,
but also large international actors,
in particular those which have committed themselves
to corporate social responsibility --
then in this magical triangle
between civil society,
government and private sector,
there is a tremendous chance
for all of us to create a better world.
I'm a cancer doctor, and I walked out of my office
and walked by the pharmacy in the hospital three or four years ago,
and this was the cover of Fortune magazine
sitting in the window of the pharmacy.
and you get a little bit downhearted.
But when you start to read the article by Cliff,
who himself is a cancer survivor,
who was saved by a clinical trial
where his parents drove him from New York City to upstate New York
to get an experimental therapy for --
at the time -- Hodgkin's disease, which saved his life,
he makes remarkable points here.
And the point of the article was that we have gotten
reductionist in our view of biology,
in our view of cancer.
For the last 50 years, we have focused on treating
the individual gene
in understanding cancer, not in controlling cancer.
And this is something that sobers us in our field everyday
in that, obviously, we've made remarkable impacts
on cardiovascular disease,
but look at cancer. The death rate in cancer
in over 50 years hasn't changed.
We've made small wins in diseases like chronic myelogenous leukemia,
where we have a pill that can put 100 percent of people in remission,
but in general, we haven't made an impact at all in the war on cancer.
is a little bit of why I think that's the case,
and then go out of my comfort zone
and tell you where I think it's going,
where a new approach -- that we hope to push forward
in terms of treating cancer.
Because this is wrong.
Well, if one has a mass or an abnormal blood value, you go to a doctor,
they stick a needle in.
They way we make the diagnosis today is by pattern recognition:
Does it look normal? Does it look abnormal?
This is a normal cell. This is a cancer cell.
That is the state-of-the-art today in diagnosing cancer.
There's no molecular test,
there's no sequencing of genes that was referred to yesterday,
there's no fancy looking at the chromosomes.
This is the state-of-the-art and how we do it.
So, as an aside, I firmly believe in the field of trying to identify cancer early.
It is the only way you can start to fight cancer, is by catching it early.
We can prevent most cancers.
You know, the previous talk alluded to preventing heart disease.
We could do the same in cancer.
I co-founded a company called Navigenics,
where, if you spit into a tube --
and we can look look at 35 or 40 genetic markers for disease,
all of which are delayable in many of the cancers --
you start to identify what you could get,
and then we can start to work to prevent them.
Because the problem is, when you have advanced cancer,
we can't do that much today about it, as the statistics allude to.
Why is it a disease of the aged?
Because evolution doesn't care about us after we've had our children.
and then, after age 35 or 40 or 45,
it said "It doesn't matter anymore, because they've had their progeny."
So if you look at cancers, it is very rare -- extremely rare --
to have cancer in a child, on the order of thousands of cases a year.
As one gets older? Very, very common.
Because it's heterogeneous,
and that's the perfect substrate for evolution within the cancer.
It starts to select out for those bad, aggressive cells,
what we call clonal selection.
But, if we start to understand
that cancer isn't just a molecular defect, it's something more,
then we'll get to new ways of treating it, as I'll show you.
is that, right now, we describe it by a number of adjectives, symptoms:
"I'm tired, I'm bloated, I have pain, etc."
You then have some anatomic descriptions,
you get that CT scan: "There's a three centimeter mass in the liver."
You then have some body part descriptions:
"It's in the liver, in the breast, in the prostate."
And that's about it.
So, our dictionary for describing cancer is very, very poor.
It's basically symptoms.
It's manifestations of a disease.
the government has spent 400 million dollars,
and they've allocated another billion dollars,
to what we call the Cancer Genome Atlas Project.
So, it is the idea of sequencing all of the genes in the cancer,
and giving us a new lexicon, a new dictionary to describe it.
You know, in the mid-1850's in France,
they started to describe cancer by body part.
That hasn't changed in over 150 years.
It is absolutely archaic that we call cancer
by prostate, by breast, by muscle.
It makes no sense, if you think about it.
and, over the next several years, that will change.
You will no longer go to a breast cancer clinic.
You will go to a HER2 amplified clinic, or an EGFR activated clinic,
and they will go to some of the pathogenic lesions
that were involved in causing this individual cancer.
So, hopefully, we will go from being the art of medicine
more to the science of medicine,
and be able to do what they do in infectious disease,
which is look at that organism, that bacteria,
and then say, "This antibiotic makes sense,
because you have a particular bacteria that will respond to it."
When one is exposed to H1N1, you take Tamiflu,
and you can remarkably decrease the severity of symptoms
and prevent many of the manifestations of the disease.
Why? Because we know what you have, and we know how to treat it --
although we can't make vaccine in this country, but that's a different story.
The first cancer was done, which was brain cancer.
In the next month, the end of December, you'll see ovarian cancer,
and then lung cancer will come several months after.
There's also a field of proteomics that I'll talk about in a few minutes,
which I think is going to be the next level
in terms of understanding and classifying disease.
But remember, I'm not pushing genomics,
proteomics, to be a reductionist.
I'm doing it so we can identify what we're up against.
And there's a very important distinction there that we'll get to.
in terms of treating disease --
most of the dollars in the last two years of a person's life.
We spend very little, if any, dollars in terms of identifying what we're up against.
If you could start to move that, to identify what you're up against,
you're going to do things a hell of a lot better.
If we could even take it one step further and prevent disease,
we can take it enormously the other direction,
and obviously, that's where we need to go, going forward.
And I'm here to tell you, it's wrong.
So, the website of the National Cancer Institute
says that cancer is a genetic disease.
The website says, "If you look, there's an individual mutation,
and maybe a second, and maybe a third,
and that is cancer."
But, as a cancer doc, this is what I see.
This isn't a genetic disease.
So, there you see, it's a liver with colon cancer in it,
and you see into the microscope a lymph node
where cancer has invaded.
You see a CT scan where cancer is in the liver.
Cancer is an interaction of a cell
that no longer is under growth control with the environment.
It's not in the abstract; it's the interaction with the environment.
It's what we call a system.
And I think that's been the fundamental problem over the last five decades,
is that we have strived to understand cancer.
The goal is to control cancer.
And that is a very different optimization scheme,
a very different strategy for all of us.
one of the big cancer research meetings, with 20,000 people there,
and I said, "We've made a mistake.
We've all made a mistake, myself included,
by focusing down, by being a reductionist.
We need to take a step back."
And, believe it or not, there were hisses in the audience.
People got upset, but this is the only way we're going to go forward.
We were pushed together, and neither one of us really wanted to meet the other.
I said, "Do I really want to meet a guy from Disney, who designed computers?"
And he was saying: Does he really want to meet another doctor?
But people prevailed on us, and we got together,
and it's been transformative in what I do, absolutely transformative.
We have designed, and we have worked on the modeling --
and much of these ideas came from Danny and from his team --
the modeling of cancer in the body as complex system.
And I'll show you some data there
where I really think it can make a difference and a new way to approach it.
you have to understand the data inputs.
You know, if I measured your temperature over 30 days,
and I asked, "What was the average temperature?"
and it came back at 98.7, I would say, "Great."
But if during one of those days
your temperature spiked to 102 for six hours,
and you took Tylenol and got better, etc.,
I would totally miss it.
So, one of the problems, the fundamental problems in medicine
is that you and I, and all of us,
we go to our doctor once a year.
We have discrete data elements; we don't have a time function on them.
You know, I've been using it for two and a half months.
It's a staggering device, not because it tells me
how many kilocalories I do every day,
but because it looks, over 24 hours, what I've done in a day.
And I didn't realize that for three hours I'm sitting at my desk,
and I'm not moving at all.
And a lot of the functions in the data that we have as input systems here
are really different than we understand them,
because we're not measuring them dynamically.
there's an input and an output and a state in the middle.
So, the states, are equivalent classes of history,
and the cancer patient, the input, is the environment,
the diet, the treatment, the genetic mutations.
The output are our symptoms:
Do we have pain? Is the cancer growing? Do we feel bloated, etc.?
Most of that state is hidden.
So what we do in our field is we change and input,
we give aggressive chemotherapy,
and we say, "Did that output get better? Did that pain improve, etc.?"
it's multiple systems on multiple scales.
It's a system of systems.
And so, when you start to look at emergent systems,
you can look at a neuron under a microscope.
A neuron under the microscope is very elegant
with little things sticking out and little things over here,
but when you start to put them together in a complex system,
and you start to see that it becomes a brain,
and that brain can create intelligence,
what we're talking about in the body,
and cancer is starting to model it like a complex system.
Well, the bad news is that these robust --
and robust is a key word --
emergent systems are very hard to understand in detail.
The good news is you can manipulate them.
You can try to control them
without that fundamental understanding of every component.
came out in February in the New England Journal of Medicine,
where they took women who were pre-menopausal with breast cancer.
So, about the worst kind of breast cancer you can get.
They had gotten their chemotherapy,
and then they randomized them,
where half got placebo,
and half got a drug called Zoledronic acid that builds bone.
It's used to treat osteoporosis,
and they got that twice a year.
They looked and, in these 1,800 women,
given twice a year a drug that builds bone,
you reduce the recurrence of cancer by 35 percent.
Reduce occurrence of cancer by a drug
that doesn't even touch the cancer.
So the notion, you change the soil, the seed doesn't grow as well.
You change that system,
and you could have a marked effect on the cancer.
nobody has ever shown that most chemotherapy
actually touches a cancer cell.
It's never been shown.
There's all these elegant work in the tissue culture dishes,
that if you give this cancer drug, you can do this effect to the cell,
but the doses in those dishes are nowhere near
the doses that happen in the body.
every three weeks, which is the standard,
about 40 percent of women with metastatic cancer
have a great response to that drug.
And a response is 50 percent shrinkage.
Well, remember that's not even an order of magnitude,
but that's a different story.
They then recur, I give them that same drug every week.
Another 30 percent will respond.
They then recur, I give them that same drug
over 96 hours by continuous infusion,
another 20 or 30 percent will respond.
So, you can't tell me it's working by the same mechanism in all three size.
It's not. We have no idea the mechanism.
So the idea that chemotherapy may just be disrupting
that complex system,
just like building bone disrupted that system and reduced recurrence,
chemotherapy may work by that same exact way.
The wild thing about that trial also,
was that it reduced new primaries, so new cancers, by 30 percent also.
They're dynamic.
I mean, this is a scary slide, not to take an aside,
but it looks at obesity in the world.
And I'm sorry if you can't read the numbers, they're kind of small.
But, if you start to look at it, that red, that dark color there,
more than 75 percent of the population
of those countries are obese.
Look a decade ago, look two decades ago: markedly different.
So, our systems today are dramatically different
than our systems a decade or two ago.
So the diseases we have today,
which reflect patterns in the system over the last several decades,
are going to change dramatically over the next decade or so
based on things like this.
of the whole proteome.
So this is a drop of blood that has gone through a superconducting magnet,
and we're able to get resolution
where we can start to see all of the proteins in the body.
We can start to see that system.
Each of the red dots are where a protein has actually been identified.
The power of these magnets, the power of what we can do here,
is that we can see an individual neutron with this technology.
So, again, this is stuff we're doing with Danny Hillis
and a group called Applied Proteomics,
where we can start to see individual neutron differences,
and we can start to look at that system like we never have before.
So, instead of a reductionist view, we're taking a step back.
who had recurrent lung cancer.
It was in her brain, in her lungs, in her liver.
She had gotten Carboplatin Taxol, Carboplatin Taxotere,
Gemcitabine, Navelbine:
Every drug we have she had gotten, and that disease continued to grow.
She had three kids under the age of 12,
and this is her CT scan.
And so what this is, is we're taking a cross-section of her body here,
and you can see in the middle there is her heart,
and to the side of her heart on the left there is this large tumor
that will invade and will kill her, untreated, in a matter of weeks.
She goes on a pill a day that targets a pathway,
and again, I'm not sure if this pathway was in the system, in the cancer,
but it targeted a pathway, and a month later, pow, that cancer's gone.
Six months later it's still gone.
That cancer recurred, and she passed away three years later from lung cancer,
but she got three years from a drug
whose symptoms predominately were acne.
That's about it.
and we were a part of it,
and in the fundamental clinical trial --
the pivotal clinical trial we call the Phase Three,
we refused to use a placebo.
Would you want your mother, your brother, your sister
to get a placebo if they had advanced lung cancer and had weeks to live?
And the answer, obviously, is not.
So, it was done on this group of patients.
Ten percent of people in the trial had this dramatic response that was shown here,
and the drug went to the FDA,
and the FDA said, "Without a placebo,
how do I know patients actually benefited from the drug?"
So the morning the FDA was going to meet,
this was the editorial in the Wall Street Journal.
(Laughter)
And so, what do you know, that drug was approved.
where they gave half placebo and half the drug.
And we learned something important there.
What's interesting is they did it in South America and Canada,
where it's "more ethical to give placebos."
They had to give it also in the U.S. to get approval,
so I think there were three U.S. patients
in upstate New York who were part of the trial.
But they did that, and what they found
is that 70 percent of the non-responders
lived much longer and did better than people who got placebo.
So it challenged everything we knew in cancer,
is that you don't need to get a response.
You don't need to shrink the disease.
If we slow the disease, we may have more of a benefit
on patient survival, patient outcome, how they feel,
than if we shrink the disease.
and you've got a two centimeter mass in your liver,
and you come back to me in three months and it's three centimeters,
did that drug help you or not?
How do I know?
Would it have been 10 centimeters, or am I giving you a drug
with no benefit and significant cost?
So, it's a fundamental problem.
And, again, that's where these new technologies can come in.
well, the ultimate goal is that you prevent disease, right?
The ultimate goal is that you prevent any of these things from happening.
That is the most effective, cost-effective,
best way we can do things today.
But if one is unfortunate to get a disease,
you'll go into your doctor's office, he or she will take a drop of blood,
and we will start to know how to treat your disease.
The way we've approached it is the field of proteomics,
again, this looking at the system.
It's taking a big picture.
that if one looks at proteins in the body,
there are 11 orders of magnitude difference
between the high-abundant and the low-abundant proteins.
So, there's no technology in the world that can span 11 orders of magnitude.
And so, a lot of what has been done with people like Danny Hillis and others
is to try to bring in engineering principles, try to bring the software.
We can start to look at different components along this spectrum.
And I think one of the exciting things that is starting to happen now
is that people from those fields are coming in.
Yesterday, the National Cancer Institute announced a new program
called the Physical Sciences and Oncology,
where physicists, mathematicians, are brought in to think about cancer,
people who never approached it before.
Danny and I got 16 million dollars, they announced yesterday,
to try to attach this problem.
A whole new approach, instead of giving high doses of chemotherapy
by different mechanisms,
to try to bring technology to get a picture of what's actually happening in the body.
because I think it's important to understand it.
What happens is every protein in your body is charged,
so the proteins are sprayed in, the magnet spins them around,
and then there's a detector at the end.
When it hit that detector is dependent on the mass and the charge.
And so we can accurately -- if the magnet is big enough,
and your resolution is high enough --
you can actually detect all of the proteins in the body
and start to get an understanding of the individual system.
instead of having paper in my chart, in your chart, and it being this thick,
this is what data flow is starting to look like in our offices,
where that drop of blood is creating gigabytes of data.
Electronic data elements are describing every aspect of the disease.
And certainly the goal is we can start to learn from every encounter
and actually move forward, instead of just having encounter and encounter,
without fundamental learning.
We need to start to think differently and radically.
And so, I implore everyone here: Think differently. Come up with new ideas.
Tell them to me or anyone else in our field,
because over the last 59 years, nothing has changed.
We need a radically different approach.
and Andy was one of my mentors, tough individual.
When Andy stepped down, he said,
"No technology will win. Technology itself will win."
And I'm a firm believer, in the field of medicine and especially cancer,
that it's going to be a broad platform of technologies
that will help us move forward
and hopefully help patients in the near-term.
I'd like to share with you a discovery that I made a few months ago
while writing an article for Italian Wired.
I always keep my thesaurus handy whenever I'm writing anything,
but I'd already finished editing the piece,
and I realized that I had never once in my life
looked up the word "disabled" to see what I'd find.
"Disabled, adjective: crippled, helpless, useless, wrecked,
stalled, maimed, wounded, mangled, lame, mutilated,
run-down, worn-out, weakened, impotent, castrated, paralyzed, handicapped,
senile, decrepit, laid-up, done-up, done-for, done-in
cracked-up, counted-out;
see also hurt, useless and weak.
Antonyms, healthy, strong, capable."
I was reading this list out loud to a friend and at first was laughing,
it was so ludicrous,
but I'd just gotten past "mangled," and my voice broke,
and I had to stop and collect myself
from the emotional shock and impact that the assault from these words unleashed.
so I'm thinking this must be an ancient print date, right?
But, in fact, the print date was the early 1980s,
when I would have been starting primary school
and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit
and as related to the other kids and the world around me.
And, needless to say, thank God I wasn't using a thesaurus back then.
I mean, from this entry, it would seem that I was born into a world
that perceived someone like me
to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them,
when in fact, today I'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures
my life has procured.
expecting to find a revision worth noting.
Here's the updated version of this entry.
Unfortunately, it's not much better.
I find the last two words under "Near Antonyms," particularly unsettling:
"whole" and "wholesome."
It's what we believe about people when we name them with these words.
It's about the values behind the words, and how we construct those values.
Our language affects our thinking and how we view the world
and how we view other people.
In fact, many ancient societies, including the Greeks and the Romans,
believed that to utter a curse verbally was so powerful,
because to say the thing out loud brought it into existence.
So, what reality do we want to call into existence:
a person who is limited, or a person who's empowered?
By casually doing something as simple as naming a person, a child,
we might be putting lids and casting shadows on their power.
Wouldn't we want to open doors for them instead?
at the A.I. duPont Institute in Wilmington, Delaware.
His name was Dr. Pizzutillo,
an Italian American, whose name, apparently,
was too difficult for most Americans to pronounce,
so he went by Dr. P.
And Dr. P always wore really colorful bow ties
and had the very perfect disposition to work with children.
with the exception of my physical therapy sessions.
I had to do what seemed like innumerable repetitions of exercises
with these thick, elastic bands -- different colors,
you know -- to help build up my leg muscles,
and I hated these bands more than anything --
I hated them, had names for them. I hated them.
And, you know, I was already bargaining, as a five year-old child,
with Dr. P to try to get out of doing these exercises,
unsuccessfully, of course.
And, one day, he came in to my session --
exhaustive and unforgiving, these sessions --
and he said to me, "Wow. Aimee, you are such a strong and powerful little girl,
I think you're going to break one of those bands.
When you do break it, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks."
to get me to do the exercises I didn't want to do
before the prospect of being the richest five-year-old in the second floor ward,
but what he effectively did for me was reshape an awful daily occurrence
into a new and promising experience for me.
And I have to wonder today to what extent his vision
and his declaration of me as a strong and powerful little girl
shaped my own view of myself
as an inherently strong, powerful and athletic person well into the future.
can ignite the power of a child.
But, in the previous instances of those thesaurus entries,
our language isn't allowing us to evolve into the reality that we would all want,
the possibility of an individual to see themselves as capable.
Our language hasn't caught up with the changes in our society,
many of which have been brought about by technology.
Certainly, from a medical standpoint,
my legs, laser surgery for vision impairment,
titanium knees and hip replacements for aging bodies
that are allowing people to more fully engage with their abilities,
and move beyond the limits that nature has imposed on them --
not to mention social networking platforms
allow people to self-identify, to claim their own descriptions of themselves,
so they can go align with global groups of their own choosing.
So, perhaps technology is revealing more clearly to us now
what has always been a truth:
that everyone has something rare and powerful to offer our society,
and that the human ability to adapt is our greatest asset.
because people have continually wanted to talk to me about overcoming adversity,
and I'm going to make an admission:
This phrase never sat right with me,
and I always felt uneasy trying to answer people's questions about it,
and I think I'm starting to figure out why.
Implicit in this phrase of "overcoming adversity"
is the idea that success, or happiness,
is about emerging on the other side of a challenging experience
unscathed or unmarked by the experience,
as if my successes in life have come about from an ability
to sidestep or circumnavigate the presumed pitfalls of a life with prosthetics,
or what other people perceive as my disability.
But, in fact, we are changed. We are marked, of course, by a challenge,
whether physically, emotionally or both.
And I'm going to suggest that this is a good thing.
Adversity isn't an obstacle that we need to get around
in order to resume living our life.
It's part of our life.
And I tend to think of it like my shadow.
Sometimes I see a lot of it, sometimes there's very little,
but it's always with me.
And, certainly, I'm not trying to diminish the impact, the weight, of a person's struggle.
and it's all very real and relative to every single person,
but the question isn't whether or not you're going to meet adversity,
but how you're going to meet it.
So, our responsibility is not simply shielding those we care for from adversity,
but preparing them to meet it well.
And we do a disservice to our kids
when we make them feel that they're not equipped to adapt.
There's an important difference and distinction
between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee
and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not I'm disabled.
And, truthfully, the only real and consistent disability I've had to confront
is the world ever thinking that I could be described by those definitions.
by giving them the cold, hard truth about their medical prognosis,
or, indeed, a prognosis on the expected quality of their life,
we have to make sure that we don't put the first brick in a wall
that will actually disable someone.
Perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you
and how do we fix it, serves to be more disabling to the individual
than the pathology itself.
by not acknowledging their potency,
we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have.
We are effectively grading someone's worth to our community.
So we need to see through the pathology
and into the range of human capability.
And, most importantly, there's a partnership
between those perceived deficiencies
and our greatest creative ability.
So it's not about devaluing, or negating, these more trying times
as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug,
but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity.
So maybe the idea I want to put out there is
not so much overcoming adversity
as it is opening ourselves up to it,
embracing it,
grappling with it,
to use a wrestling term,
maybe even dancing with it.
And, perhaps, if we see adversity as natural, consistent and useful,
we're less burdened by the presence of it.
and it was 150 years ago, when writing about evolution,
that Darwin illustrated, I think, a truth about the human character.
To paraphrase: It's not the strongest of the species that survives,
nor is it the most intelligent that survives;
it is the one that is most adaptable to change.
Conflict is the genesis of creation.
From Darwin's work, amongst others, we can recognize that
the human ability to survive and flourish
is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict
into transformation.
So, again, transformation, adaptation, is our greatest human skill.
And, perhaps, until we're tested, we don't know what we're made of.
Maybe that's what adversity gives us:
a sense of self, a sense of our own power.
So, we can give ourselves a gift.
We can re-imagine adversity as something more than just tough times.
Maybe we can see it as change.
Adversity is just change that we haven't adapted ourselves to yet.
is this idea of normalcy.
Now, who's normal?
There's no normal.
There's common, there's typical. There's no normal,
and would you want to meet that poor, beige person if they existed?
(Laughter)
I don't think so.
If we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy
to one of possibility -- or potency, to be even a little bit more dangerous --
we can release the power of so many more children,
and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community.
we as humans have always required of our community members
is to be of use, to be able to contribute.
There's evidence that Neanderthals, 60,000 years ago,
carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury,
and perhaps it's because the life experience of survival of these people
proved of value to the community.
They didn't view these people as broken and useless;
they were seen as rare and valuable.
in that red zone in northeastern Pennsylvania,
and I was standing over a bushel of tomatoes.
It was summertime: I had shorts on.
I hear this guy, his voice behind me say, "Well, if it isn't Aimee Mullins."
And I turn around, and it's this older man. I have no idea who he is.
I mean, when we met I was delivering you from your mother's womb."
(Laughter)
Oh, that guy.
And, but of course, actually, it did click.
a man that I had only known about through my mother's stories of that day,
because, of course, typical fashion, I arrived late for my birthday by two weeks.
And so my mother's prenatal physician had gone on vacation,
so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents.
And, because I was born without the fibula bones,
and had feet turned in, and a few toes in this foot and a few toes in that,
he had to be the bearer -- this stranger had to be the bearer of bad news.
that you would never walk,
and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have
or any kind of life of independence,
and you've been making liar out of me ever since."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
newspaper clippings throughout my whole childhood,
whether winning a second grade spelling bee,
marching with the Girl Scouts, you know, the Halloween parade,
winning my college scholarship, or any of my sports victories,
and he was using it, and integrating it into teaching resident students,
med students from Hahnemann Medical School and Hershey Medical School.
And he called this part of the course the X Factor,
the potential of the human will.
No prognosis can account for how powerful this could be
as a determinant in the quality of someone's life.
And Dr. Kean went on to tell me,
he said, "In my experience, unless repeatedly told otherwise,
and even if given a modicum of support,
if left to their own devices, a child will achieve."
He understood that there's a difference between the medical condition
and what someone might do with it.
And there's been a shift in my thinking over time,
in that, if you had asked me at 15 years old,
if I would have traded prosthetics for flesh-and-bone legs,
I wouldn't have hesitated for a second.
I aspired to that kind of normalcy back then.
But if you ask me today, I'm not so sure.
And it's because of the experiences I've had with them,
not in spite of the experiences I've had with them.
And perhaps this shift in me has happened
because I've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me
than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me.
to show you the epiphany of your own power, and you're off.
If you can hand somebody the key to their own power --
the human spirit is so receptive -- if you can do that
and open a door for someone at a crucial moment,
you are educating them in the best sense.
You're teaching them to open doors for themselves.
In fact, the exact meaning of the word "educate"
comes from the root word "educe."
It means "to bring forth what is within,
to bring out potential."
So again, which potential do we want to bring out?
when they were moving from grammar schools to comprehensive schools.
It's called the streaming trials. We call it "tracking" here in the States.
It's separating students from A, B, C, D and so on.
And the "A students" get the tougher curriculum, the best teachers, etc.
Well, they took, over a three-month period,
D-level students, gave them A's,
told them they were "A's," told them they were bright,
and at the end of this three-month period,
they were performing at A-level.
is that they took the "A students" and told them they were "D's."
And that's what happened at the end of that three-month period.
Those who were still around in school, besides the people who had dropped out.
A crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too.
The teachers didn't know a switch had been made.
They were simply told, "These are the 'A-students,' these are the 'D-students.'"
And that's how they went about teaching them and treating them.
a spirit that's been crushed doesn't have hope,
it doesn't see beauty,
it no longer has our natural, childlike curiosity
and our innate ability to imagine.
If instead, we can bolster a human spirit to keep hope,
to see beauty in themselves and others,
to be curious and imaginative,
then we are truly using our power well.
When a spirit has those qualities, we are able to create new realities
and new ways of being.
by a fourteenth-century Persian poet named Hafiz
that my friend, Jacques Dembois told me about,
and the poem is called "The God Who Only Knows Four Words":
"Every child has known God,
not the God of names,
not the God of don'ts,
but the God who only knows four words and keeps repeating them,
saying, 'Come dance with me.
Come, dance with me. Come, dance with me.'"
(Applause)
Someone once said that politics is, of course, "showbiz for ugly people."
So, on that basis, I feel like I've really arrived.
The other thing to think of is what an honor it is, as a politician,
to give a TED talk, particularly here in the U.K.,
where the reputation of politics, with the expenses scandal, has sunk so low.
actually replacing rats in their experiments with politicians.
And someone asked,"Why?"
and they said, "Well, there's no shortage of politicians,
no one really minds what happens to them
and, after all, there are some things that rats just won't do."
(Laughter)
This, I think, is the most important fact to bear in mind
in British politics or American politics,
and that is: We have run out of money.
We have vast budget deficits.
This is my global public debt clock,
and, as you can see, it's 32 trillion and counting.
is a very simple recognition,
that there's one question in politics at the moment above all other,
and it's this one: How do we make things better without spending more money?
Because there isn't going to be a lot of money to improve public services,
or to improve government, or to improve so many of the things
that politicians talk about.
So what follows from that is that if you think it's all about money --
you can only measure success in public services
in health care and education and policing by spending more money,
you can only measure progress by spending money --
you're going to have a pretty miserable time.
things like your family relationships, friendship, community, values --
then, actually, this is an incredibly exciting time to be in politics.
And the really simple argument I want to make tonight,
the really straightforward argument is this:
That if we combine the right political philosophy, the right political thinking,
with the incredible information revolution that has taken place,
and that all of you know so much more about than I do,
I think there's an incredible opportunity to actually remake politics,
remake government, remake public services,
and achieve what's up on that slide, which is a big increase in our well-being.
That's the argument I want to make tonight.
Now I'm not saying for a minute that British Conservatives have all the answers.
Of course we don't.
But there are two things at heart that I think drive a conservative philosophy
that are really relevant to this whole debate.
The first is this: We believe that if you give people
more power and control over their lives,
if you give people more choice,
if you put them in the driving seat,
then actually, you can create a stronger and better society.
And if you marry this fact with the incredible abundance
of information that we have in our world today,
I think you can completely, as I've said,
remake politics, remake government, remake your public services.
Politics and politicians will only succeed
if they actually try and treat with people as they are,
rather than as they would like them to be.
Now, if you combine this very simple, very conservative thought --
go with the grain of human nature --
with all the advances in behavioral economics,
some of which we were just hearing about,
again, I think we can achieve a real increase in well-being,
in happiness, in a stronger society
without necessarily having to spend a whole lot more money.
Well, I'm afraid you're going to suffer a short, condensed history lesson
about what I would say are the three passages of history:
the pre-bureaucratic age, the bureaucratic age
and what we now live in, which I think is a post-bureaucratic age.
A simpler way of thinking of it
is that we have gone from a world of local control,
then we went to a world of central control,
and now we're in a world of people control.
Local power, central power, now, people power.
Thought he could turn back the waves; couldn't turn back the waves.
Couldn't actually turn back very much,
because if you were king a thousand years ago,
while it still took hours and hours and weeks and weeks to traverse your own country,
there wasn't much you were in charge of.
You weren't in charge of policing, justice, education, health, welfare.
You could just about go to war and that was about it.
This was the pre-bureaucratic age,
an age in which everything had to be local.
You had to have local control because there was no nationally-available information
because travel was so restricted.
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age.
the lovely picture of the British Industrial Revolution.
Suddenly, all sorts of transport, travel information were possible,
and this gave birth to, what I like to call, the bureaucratic age.
And hopefully this slide is going to morph beautifully. There we are.
Suddenly, you have the big, strong, central state.
It was able -- but only it was able -- to organize
health care, education, policing, justice.
And it was a world of, as I say, not local power, but now central power.
It had sucked all that power up from the localities.
It was able to do that itself.
the massive information revolution.
Just consider this one fact:
One hundred years ago, sending these 10 words cost 50 dollars.
Right now, here we are linked up to Long Beach and everywhere else,
and all these secret locations for a fraction of that cost,
and we can send and receive huge quantities of information
without it costing anything.
So we're now living in a post-bureaucratic age,
where genuine people power is possible.
for our public services, for our government?
Well I can't, in the time I've got, give huge numbers of examples,
but let me just give a few of the ways that life can change.
And this is so obvious, in a way, because
you think about how all of you have changed
the way we shop, the way we travel, the way that business is done.
That is already happened; the information and Internet revolution
has actually gone all the way through our societies in so many different ways,
but it hasn't, in every way, yet touched our government.
Well, I think there are three chief ways that it should make an enormous difference:
in transparency, in greater choice and in accountability,
in giving us that genuine people power.
If we take transparency, here is one of my favorite websites,
the Missouri Accountability Portal.
In the old days, only the government could hold the information,
and only a few elected people could try and grab that information
and question it and challenge it.
Now here, on one website, one state in America,
every single dollar spent by that government
is searchable, is analyzable, is checkable.
Any business that wants to bid for a government contract
can see what currently is being spent.
Anyone thinking, "I could do that service better, I could deliver it cheaper,"
it's all available there.
We have only, in government and in politics,
started to scratch the surface of what people are doing in the commercial world
with the information revolution.
So, complete transparency will make a huge difference.
In this country, if we win the election,
we are going to make all government spending over 25,000 pounds
transparent and available online, searchable for anyone to see.
We're going to make every contract -- we're announcing this today --
available on the Internet so anyone can see
what the terms are, what the conditions are,
driving huge value for money,
but also huge increases, I believe, in well-being as well.
and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface
of public services like education, or health care or policing,
and you're going to see this change massively.
We should be making this change
with the information revolution in our country,
with searchable health sites, so you can see what operations work out properly,
what records doctors have, the cleanliness of hospitals,
who does best at infection control --
all of the information that would once be locked in the Department of Health
is now available for all of us to see.
This, I think, is a huge change.
It is a crime map. This is a crime map from Chicago.
So, instead of having a situation where only the police have the information
about which crimes are committed where,
and we have to employ people in government
to try and hold the police to account,
suddenly, we've got this vast opportunity for people power,
where we, as citizens, can see what crimes are being committed --
where, when and by whom --
and we can hold the police to account.
And you can see this looks a bit like a chef's hat,
but actually that's an assault, the one in blue.
You can see what crime is committed where,
and you have the opportunity to hold your police force to account.
So those three ways -- transparency, accountability and choice --
will make a huge difference.
that I think we should work on is understanding of people,
is recognizing that going with the grain of human nature
you can achieve so much more.
Now, we're got a huge revolution in understanding
of why people behave in the way that they do,
and a great opportunity to put that knowledge and information to greater use.
We're working with some of these people.
We're being advised by some of these people, as was said,
to try and bring all the experience to book.
We want to get people to be more energy efficient.
Why? It cuts fuel poverty, it cuts their bills,
and it cuts carbon emissions at the same time.
How do you do it?
Well, we've had government information campaigns over the years
when they tell you to switch off the lights when you leave the home.
We even had -- one government minister once told us to
brush our teeth in the dark.
I don't think they lasted very long.
Look at what this does. This is a simple piece of behavioral economics.
The best way to get someone to cut their electricity bill
is to show them their own spending,
to show them what their neighbors are spending,
and then show what an energy conscious neighbor is spending.
That sort of behavioral economics
can transform people's behavior
in a way that all the bullying and all the information
and all the badgering from a government cannot possibly achieve.
Other examples are recycling.
We all know we need to recycle more.
How do we make it happen?
All the proof from America is that actually, if you pay people to recycle,
if you give them a carrot rather than a stick,
you can transform their behavior.
Here are my two favorite U.S. speeches of the last 50 years.
Obviously, here we have JFK with that incredibly simple
and powerful formulation,
"Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country,"
an incredibly noble sentiment.
But when he made that speech, what could you do
to build the stronger, better society?
You could fight for your country, you could die for your country,
you could serve in your country's civil service,
but you didn't really have the information and the knowledge
and the ability to help build the stronger society in the way that you do now.
which I'm going to read a big chunk of,
which sums up what I said at the beginning
about believing there is more to life than money,
and more that we should try and measure than money.
And it is Robert Kennedy's beautiful description
of why gross national product captures so little:
It "does not allow for the health of our children,
the quality of their education, or the joy of their play.
It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages,
the intelligence of our public debate.
It measures neither our wit nor our courage,
neither our wisdom nor our learning,
neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.
It measures everything, in short,
except that which makes life worthwhile."
and a beautiful dream 40 years ago,
but now with the huge advances in information technology,
with the massive changes in behavioral economics,
with all that we know about how you advance well-being,
that if we combine those insights
of giving power to people, and using information to make that possible,
and using the insight of going with the grain of human nature,
while at the same time, understanding why people behave in the way they do,
it is a dream more easy to realize today
than it was when it was made in that beautiful speech 40 years ago.
(Applause)
About a year and a half ago,
Stephen Lawler, who also gave a talk
here at TED in 2007 on Virtual Earth,
brought me over to become the architect of Bing Maps,
which is Microsoft's online-mapping effort.
In the past two and a half, we've been very hard at work
on redefining the way maps work online.
And we really are seeing this in very different terms
from the kind of mapping and direction site
that one is used to.
is just the fluidity of the zooming and the panning,
which, if you're familiar at all with Seadragon,
that's where it comes from.
not just about cartography,
it's also about imagery.
So, as we zoom-in beyond a certain level
this resolves into a kind of Sim City-like
virtual view at 45 degrees.
This can be viewed from any of the cardinal directions
to show you the 3D structure of the city, all the facades.
Now, we see this space, this three-dimensional environment,
as being a canvas on which
all sorts of applications can play out,
and map's directions are really just one of them.
some of the ones that we've put out, just in the past couple of months
since we've launched.
So, for example, a couple of days after the disaster in Haiti,
we had an earthquake map that showed
before and after pictures from the sky.
This wonderful one which I don't have time to show you
is taking hyper-local blogs in real time
and mapping those stories, those entries
to the places that are referred to on the blogs.
It's wonderful.
not stopping at the sky.
These little green bubbles represent
photosynths that users have made.
I'm not going to dive into them either, but photosynths are integrated into the map.
Everything that's cased in blue
is an area where we've taken imagery on the ground as well.
and you see this kind of panoramic imagery,
the first thing that you might notice is that it's not just a picture,
there's just as much three-dimensional understanding of this environment
as there is of the three-dimensional city from above,
so if I click on something to get a closer view of it,
then, the fact that that transition looks as it does,
is a function of all of that geometry,
all of that 3D understanding behind this model.
that -- we've been working on a collaboration with our friends at Flickr.
This takes Flickr, georegistered imagery
and uses photosynth-like processes
to connect that imagery to our imagery, so --
I'm not sure if that's the one I actually meant to pull up, but --
and there are lots of photos around here,
and these photos are all taken at different times.
So this one was taken around five.
So that's the Flickr photo,
that's our imagery.
So you really see how this kind of crowd-sourced imagery
is integrating, in a very deep way, into the map itself.
and one of them, of course, is time travel.
And I'm not going to show you some of the wonderful historic imagery in here,
but there are some with horses and carriages and so on as well.
But what's cool about this is that, not only is it augmenting
this visual representation of the world
with things that are coming in from users,
but it also is the foundation for augmented reality,
and that's something that I'll be showing you more of in just a moment.
OK, notice there's now a roof above us.
We're inside the Pike Place Market.
And this is something that we're able to do with a backpack camera,
so, we're now not only imaging in the street
with this camera on tops of cars,
but we're also imaging inside.
And from here, we're able to do the same sorts of registration,
not only of still images, but also of video.
for the first time, live,
and this is really, truly, very frightening.
I'm live. All right. There we go.
So, these are our friends in Pike Place Market, the lab.
OK, George, can you pan back over to the corner market?
Because I want to show points of interest.
No, no. The other way.
Yeah, yeah, back to the corner, back to the corner.
I don't want to see you guys yet.
OK, OK, back to the corner, back to the corner, back to the corner.
OK, never mind.
over here on top of the image
because what that gives you a sense of is the way,
if you're actually on the spot,
you can think about this --
this is taking a step in addition to augmented reality.
OK, I'm hanging up now.
We're doing two different things here.
One of them is to take that real ...
They've done a fantastic job of pulling this together.
And while I walk outside, I'll just mention that
here we're using this for telepresence,
but you can equally well use this
on the spot, for augmented reality.
When you use it on the spot, it means that
you're able to bring all of that metadata
and information about the world to you.
So here, we're taking the extra step of also broadcasting it.
That was being broadcast, by the way, on a 4G network
from the market.
that Microsoft has given in the past several years.
And that's Curtis Wong, WorldWide Telescope.
So, we're going to head over to the dumpsters,
where it's traditional, after a long day at the market,
to go out for a break, but also stare up at the sky.
This is the integration
of WorldWide Telescope into our maps.
this is the current time. If we scrub the time,
then we can see how the sky will look at different times,
and we can get all of this very detailed
information about different times, different dates:
Let's move the moon a little higher in the sky,
maybe change the date.
I would like to kind of zoom in on the moon.
So, this is an astronomically complete
representation of the sky
integrated right into the Earth.
so I've got to stop.
Thank you all very much.

We're in a tipping-point moment.

I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about:
This is a normal family, guys.

movers and shakers in America."
So, my wish.
to fight obesity.
When my brother called me in December of 1998,
he said, "The news does not look good."
This is him on the screen.
He'd just been diagnosed with ALS,
which is a disease that the average lifespan is three years.
It paralyzes you. It starts by killing
And you go from being a healthy,
robust 29-year-old male
to someone that cannot breathe,
cannot move, cannot speak.
because we began a journey
to learn a new way of thinking about life.
And even though Steven passed away three years ago
we had an amazing journey as a family.
We did not even --
I think adversity is not even the right word.
in an incredibly positive way."
And I want to talk today
about one of the things that we decided to do,
which was to think about a new way of approaching healthcare.
Because, as we all know here today,
it doesn't work very well.
I want to talk about it in the context of a story.
But it's just a story. And I want to go beyond the story,
and go to something more.
"Given my status, what is the best outcome
I can hope to achieve, and how do I get there?"
is what we are here to do in medicine, is what everyone should do.
And those questions all have variables to them.
All of our statuses are different.
All of our hopes and dreams, what we want to accomplish,
is different, and our paths will be different,
they are all stories.
was to take Steven's status, "What is my status?"
and go from this concept of walking, breathing,
and then his hands, speak,
and ultimately happiness and function.
So, the first set of pathologies, they end up in the stick man
on his icon,
but the rest of them are really what's important here.
Because Steven, despite the fact that he was paralyzed,
as he was in that pool, he could not walk,
he was happy. We were at the beach,
he was raising his son, and he was productive.
But it's not a data point at that one moment in time.
It is a data point of Steven in a context.
Here he is in the pool. But here he is healthy,
got all the women, amazing guy.
Here he is walking down the aisle,
but he can barely walk now, so it's impaired.
And here he is, paralyzed completely,
unable to breathe and move, over this time journey.
He renovated my carriage house
when he was completely paralyzed, and unable to speak,
excited about,
because we have gone away from the community that we are,
the fact that we really do love each other and want to care for each other.
We need to give to others to be successful.
So, Steven is sharing this story,
but he is not alone.
There are so many other people sharing their stories.
Not stories in words, but stories in data and words.
And we convert that information into this structure,
this understanding, this ability to convert
those stories into something that is computable,
to which we can begin to change the way
medicine is done and delivered.
to find the meaningful information about the disease.
So, this is what it looks like when you go to the website.
And I'm going to show you what Patients Like Me,
the company that myself, my youngest brother
and a good friend from MIT started.
sharing their stories as data.
Here is an M.S. patient.
His name is Mike, and he is uniformly impaired
on cognition, vision, walking, sensation.
Those are things that are different for each M.S. patient.
Each of them can have a different characteristic.
You can see fibromyalgia, HIV, ALS, depression.
Look at this HIV patient down here, Zinny.
But he is working to keep his CD4 count high
and his viral level low so he can make his life better.
Look at this, 2,000 people almost, on Copaxone.
These are patients currently on drugs,
sharing data.
I love some of these, physical exercise, prayer.
Anyone want to run a comparative effectiveness study
on prayer against something? Let's look at prayer.
These are why people pray.
Here is the schedule of how frequently they -- it's a dose.
So, anyone want to see the 32 patients that pray for 60 minutes a day,
and see if they're doing better, they probably are.
Here they are. It's an open network,
everybody is sharing. We can see it all.
And here is data on 15,000 people's current anxiety, right now.
How they treat it,
the drugs, the components of it,
their side effects, all of it in a rich environment,
and you can drill down and see the individuals.
This amazing data allows us to drill down and see
what this drug is for --
who are taking four milligrams a day.
And I want to talk to the ones of those that have been doing
So, you can see the duration.
And you can see here, as this animates over,
against this information.
The blue band is the 50th percentile. Steven is the 75th percentile,
that he has non-genetic ALS.
You scroll down in this profile and you can see
all of his prescription drugs,
Wait, poor spinal capacity.
Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves
Detrol. In the side effects for his drug,
integrated into that, the stem cell transplant that he had,
which was, again, the only patient's data that was online and available.
You can adjust the time scale. You can adjust the symptoms.
So, you click down on the ALS tab there.
I can look at my constipation, how to manage it.
I can see magnesium citrate, and the side effects
from that drug all integrated in the time
I don't want to just look at this cool device, I want to take this
data and make something even better.
I want my brother's center of the universe and his symptoms
and all of the things that interact among those,
the side effects, to be in this beautiful data galaxy
that we can look at in any way we want to understand it,
so that we can take this information
and go beyond just this simple model
I want to solve a problem. I want an application.
put the symptoms in the left, the drugs across the top,
tell me everything we know about Steven and everyone else,
and what interacts.
Years after he's had these drugs,
I learned that everything he did to manage his excess saliva,
including some positive side effects that came from other drugs,
were making his constipation worse.
And if anyone's ever had severe constipation,
and you don't understand how much of an impact that has on your life --
yes, that was a pun.
and this grid is available here,
and we want to understand it.
No one's ever had this kind of information.
So, patients have this. We're for patients.
This is about the patients.
So, how can we take this and bring them a tool
that they can go back and they can engage the medical system?
And we worked hard, and we thought about it and we said,
"What's something we can use all the time,
that we can use in the medical care system,
that everyone will understand?"
because hospitals usually block us
because they believe we are a social network.
It's actually the most used feature on the website.
Doctors actually love this sheet, and they're actually really engaged.
So, we went from this story of Steven
and his history to data, and then back to paper,
where we went back and engaged the medical care system.
And here's another paper.
This is a journal, PNAS --
I think it's the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science
of the United States of America.
You've seen multiple of these today, when everyone's bragging about
the amazing things they've done.
This is a report about a drug called lithium.
Lithium, that is a drug used to treat bipolar disorder,
that a group in Italy found
slowed ALS down in 16 patients, and published it.
But the short story is: If you're a patient,
you want to be on the blue line.
You don't want to be on the red line, you want to be on the blue line.
Because the blue line is a better line. The red line
is way downhill, the blue line is a good line.
So, you know we said -- we looked at this, and what I love also
is that people always accuse these Internet sites
of promoting bad medicine and having people do things irresponsibly.
So, this is what happened when PNAS published this.
Ten percent of the people in our system took lithium.
Ten percent of the patients started taking lithium based on 16 patients of data
in a bad publication.
And they call the Internet irresponsible.
Here's the implication of what happens.
who unfortunately passed away nine months ago,
who said, "Hey, listen. Can you help us answer this question?
Because I don't want to wait for the next trial, it's going to be years.
I want to know now. Can you help us?"
So, we launched some tools, we let them track their blood levels.
We let them share the data and exchange it.
You know, a data network.
And they said, you know, "Jamie, PLM,
can you guys tell us whether this works or not?"
And we went around and we talked to people,
and they said, "You can't run a clinical trial like this. You know?
You don't have the blinding, you don't have data,
it doesn't follow the scientific method.
It's never going to work. You can't do it."
(Laughter)
I can't say whether lithium works in all ALS patients,
but I can say whether it works in Humberto.
I bought a Mac about two years ago, I converted over,
and I was so excited about this new feature of the time machine
that came in Leopard. And we said -- because it's really cool,
you can go back and you can look at the entire history of your computer,
and find everything you've lost, and I loved it.
And I said, "What if we built a time machine for patients,
except instead of going backwards, we go forwards.
Can we find out what's going to happen to you,
so that you can maybe change it?"
That's the Apple background, we stole that because we didn't have time
to build our own. This is a real app by the way.
This is not just graphics.
And you take those data, and we find the patients like him, and we bring
their data together. And we bring their histories into it.
And then we say, "Well how do we line them all up?"
So, we line them all up so they go together
around the meaningful points,
integrated across everything we know about the patient.
Full information, the entire course of their disease.
And that's what is going to happen to Humberto,
unless he does something.
And he took lithium, and he went down the line.
And it works almost every time.
But almost all the time it works.
It's actually scary. It's beautiful.
So, we couldn't run a clinical trial, we couldn't figure it out.
But we could see whether it was going to work for Humberto.
And yeah, all the clinicians in the audience will talk about power
and all the standard deviation. We'll do that later.
But here is the answer
of the mean of the patients that actually decided
to take lithium.
These are all the patients that started lithium.
It's the Intent to Treat Curve.
You can see here, the blue dots on the top, the light ones,
those are the people in the study in PNAS
that you wanted to be on. And the red ones are the ones,
the pink ones on the bottom are the ones you didn't want to be.
And the ones in the middle are all of our patients
from the start of lithium at time zero,
going forward, and then going backward.
Terrifyingly accurate matching.
And going forward, you actually don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
You're actually doing slightly worse -- not significantly,
but slightly worse. You don't want to be a lithium patient this time.
But you know, a lot of people dropped out,
the trial, there is too much drop out.
Can we do the even harder thing? Can we go to the patients
that actually decided to stay on lithium,
because they were so convinced they were getting better?
are those 69 patients -- by the way, you'll notice
that's four times the number of patients in the clinical trial --
can we look at those patients and say,
"Can we match them with our time machine
to the other patients that are just like them,
and what happens?"
Even the ones that believed they were getting better
matched the controls exactly. Exactly.
Those little lines? That's the power.
that if you did it at a higher dose
or if you run the study proper -- I can tell you
that for those 69 people that took lithium,
they didn't do any better than the people that were just like them,
just like me,
and that we had the power to detect that at about
a quarter of the strengths reported in the initial study.
We did that one year ahead of the time
when the first clinical trial funded by the NIH
for millions of dollars failed for futility last week,
and announced it.
I never really knew whether it worked.
And I put 100 million cells in his cisterna magna,
in his lumbar cord,
and filled out the IRBs and did all this work,
and I never really knew.
How did I not know?
I mean, I didn't know what was going to happen to him.
I actually asked Tim, who is the quant in our group --
we actually searched for about a year to find someone
who could do the sort of math and statistics and modeling
in healthcare, couldn't find anybody. So, we went to the finance industry.
And there are these guys who used to model the future
of interest rates, and all that kind of stuff.
And some of them were available. So, we hired one.
(Laughter)
I I.M. him things. That's the way I communicate with him,
is like a little guy in a box. I I.M.ed Tim. I said,
"Tim can you tell me whether my brother's stem cell transplant
worked or not?"
And he sent me this two days ago.
It was that little outliers there. You see that guy that lived a long time?
We have to go talk to him. Because I'd like to know what happened.
Because something went different.
But my brother didn't. My brother went straight down the line.
It only works about 12 months.
First time we ever tried it. We'll try to get it better later
but 12 months so far.
And, you know, I look at this,
and I get really emotional.
You look at the patients, you can drill in all the controls,
you can look at them, you can ask them.
And I found a woman that had --
we found her, she was odd because she had data
after she died.
And her husband had come in and entered her last functional scores,
because he knew how much she cared.
And I am thankful.
years after my brother had died,
helped me answer the question about whether
an operation I did, and spent millions of dollars on
years ago, worked or not.
I wished it had been there
when I'd done it the first time,
and I'm really excited that it's here now,
because the lab that I founded
has some data on a drug that might work,
and I'd like to show it.
I'd like to show it in real time, now,
and I want to do that for all of the diseases that we can do that for.
I've got to thank the 45,000 people
that are doing this social experiment with us.
There is an amazing journey we are going on
to become human again,
to be part of community again,
to share of ourselves, to be vulnerable,
and it's very exciting. So, thank you.
(Applause)
So, imagine you're standing on a street anywhere in America
and a Japanese man comes up to you and says,
This is 26th, that's 27th."
Streets have names; blocks are just the
unnamed spaces in between streets."
you turn to a person next to you and say,
Blocks have names.
Just look at Google Maps here. There's Block 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19.
All of these blocks have names,
and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks.
There's Block 17, house number one."
I noticed that the house numbers don't go in order."
The first house ever built on a block is house number one.
The second house ever built is house number two.
Third is house number three. It's easy. It's obvious."

and realize that the opposite of them may also be true.
who believe that it's their job to keep you healthy.
So, any month you are healthy you pay them,
and when you're sick you don't have to pay them because they failed
at their job. They get rich when you're healthy, not sick.
(Applause)
as the downbeat, the beginning of the musical phrase: one, two, three, four.
But in West African music, the "one"
is thought of as the end of the phrase,
like the period at the end of a sentence.
So, you can hear it not just in the phrasing, but the way they count off their music:
two, three, four, one.
(Laughter)
the opposite is also true.
So, let's never forget, whether at TED, or anywhere else,
that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear,
that the opposite may also be true.
Domo arigato gozaimashita.

Now imagine what you could place in your hands:

Now open your eyes.
What about a life?
He looks like he's resting peacefully, but in fact he's struggling to stay alive
because he can't regulate his own body temperature.
This baby is so tiny he doesn't have
enough fat on his body to stay warm.
Sadly, 20 million babies like this
are born every year around the world.
Four million of these babies die annually.
grow up with severe, long-term health problems.
The reason is because in the first month of a baby's life,
its only job is to grow.
If it's battling hypothermia, its organs can't develop normally,
resulting in a range of health problems
from diabetes, to heart disease,
to low I.Q.
Imagine: Many of these problems could be prevented
if these babies were just kept warm.
But traditional incubators require electricity
and cost up to 20 thousand dollars.
So, you're not going to find them in rural areas of developing countries.
As a result, parents resort to local solutions
like tying hot water bottles around their babies' bodies,
or placing them under light bulbs like the ones you see here --
methods that are both ineffective and unsafe.
I've seen this firsthand over and over again.
who had just given birth to a tiny premature baby, Rani.
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic,
and the doctor advised her to take Rani
to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator.
But that hospital was over four hours away,
and Sevitha didn't have the means to get there,
so her baby died.
my team and I realized what was needed was a local solution,
something that could work without electricity,
that was simple enough for a mother or a midwife to use,
given that the majority of births still take place in the home.
We needed something that was portable,
something that could be sterilized and reused across multiple babies
and something ultra-low-cost,
compared to the 20,000 dollars
that an incubator in the U.S. costs.
What you see here looks nothing like an incubator.
It looks like a small sleeping bag for a baby.
You can open it up completely. It's waterproof.
There's no seams inside so you can sterilize it very easily.
But the magic is in this pouch of wax.
This is a phase-change material.
It's a wax-like substance with a melting point
of human body temperature, 37 degrees Celsius.
You can melt this simply using hot water
and then when it melts it's able to maintain one constant temperature
for four to six hours at a time,
after which you simply reheat the pouch.
So, you then place it into this little pocket back here,
and it creates a warm micro-environment
for the baby.
by going into the field to talk to doctors, moms and clinicians
to ensure that this really meets the needs of the local communities.
We plan to launch this product in India in 2010,
and the target price point will be 25 dollars,
less than 0.1 percent of the cost
of a traditional incubator.
of almost a million babies.
But the longer-term social impact is a reduction in population growth.
This seems counterintuitive,
but turns out that as infant mortality is reduced,
population sizes also decrease,
because parents don't need to anticipate
that their babies are going to die.
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer
and other simple innovations like this
represent a new trend for the future of technology:
simple, localized, affordable solutions
that have the potential to make huge social impact.
We really tried to understand the end user,
in this case, people like Sevitha.
We tried to understand the root of the problem
rather than being biased by what already exists.
And then we thought of the most simple solution we could
to address this problem.
In doing this, I believe we can truly bring technology to the masses.
And we can save millions of lives through the simple warmth of an Embrace.
Namaste. Good morning.
I'm very happy to be here in India.
And I've been thinking a lot about what I have learned
over these last particularly 11 years
with V-Day and "The Vagina Monologues,"
traveling the world,
essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet
to stop violence against women.
is this particular cell,
or grouping of cells, that is in each and every one of us.
And I want to call it the girl cell.
And it's in men as well as in women.
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells
is central to the evolution of our species
and the continuation of the human race.
a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world
understood that the suppression of this particular cell,
the oppression of these cells,
the reinterpretation of these cells,
the undermining of these cells,
getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells
and the crushing, eradicating, destroying,
reducing these cells,
basically began the process of killing off the girl cell,
which was, by the way, patriarchy.
in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness.
And it is essential to balance, to wisdom
and to actually the future of all of us.
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell
is compassion,
and it's empathy, and it's passion itself,
and it's vulnerability,
and it's openness, and it's intensity,
and it's association, and it's relationship,
and it is intuitive.
and that vulnerability is our greatest strength,
and that emotions have inherent logic,
which lead to radical, appropriate, saving action.
And then let's remember that we've been taught
the exact opposite by the powers that be,
that compassion clouds your thinking,
that it gets in the way,
that vulnerability is weakness,
that emotions are not to be trusted,
and you're not supposed to take things personally,
which is one of my favorites.
been brought up not to be a girl.
How do we bring up boys? What does it mean to be a boy?
To be a boy really means not to be a girl.
To be a man means not to be a girl.
To be a woman means not to be a girl.
To be strong means not to be a girl.
To be a leader means not to be a girl.
I actually think that
being a girl is so powerful
that we've had to train everyone not to be that.
(Laughter)
of course, is that denying girl,
suppressing girl, suppressing emotion,
refusing feeling has lead thus here.
Where we have now come to live in a world where
the most extreme forms of violence,
the most horrific poverty,
genocide, mass rapes,
the destruction of the Earth, is completely out of control.
And because we have suppressed our girl cells
and suppressed our girl-ship,
we do not feel what is going on.
the adequate response to what is happening.
I want to talk a little bit about
the Democratic Republic of Congo.
For me, it was the turning point of my life.
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years.
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world,
a lot of violence.
But the Democratic Republic of Congo
really was the turning point in my soul.
I went and I spent time
in a place called Bukavu
in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital,
with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I've ever met.
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege.
In the Congo, for those of you who don't know,
there has been a war raging for the last 12 years,
a war that has killed nearly six million people.
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women
have been raped there.
I sat with women
who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories.
Their stories were so horrific,
and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence,
that to be perfectly honest with you, I was shattered.
And I will tell you that what happened
is through that shattering,
listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated,
who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them
so they had holes, literally, inside them
where their pee and poop came out of them.
who were tied to chains and circled,
and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically,
all in the name of economic exploitation
to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them.
My mind was so shattered.
actually emboldened me
in a way I have never been emboldened.
That shattering, that opening of my girl cell,
that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart
allowed me to become more courageous, and braver,
and actually more clever
than I had been in the past in my life.
know that empire-building
is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building.
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth,
and excavating the Earth, and destroying things.
I remember, for example, when my father,
who was very, very violent, used to beat me.
And he would actually say, while he was beating me,
"Don't you cry. Don't you dare cry."
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him.
And even in the moment he didn't want to be reminded
of what he was doing.
And I want to say we've annihilated it in men as well as in women.
And I think in some ways
we've been much harsher to men
in the annihilation of their girl cell.
(Applause)
I see how boys have been brought up, and I see this across the planet:
to be tough, to be hardened,
to distance themselves from their tenderness, to not cry.
I actually realized once in Kosovo,
when I watched a man break down,
that bullets are actually hardened tears,
that when we don't allow men to have their girl self
and have their vulnerability, and have their compassion,
and have their hearts, that they become hardened and hurtful
and violent.
when they are insecure,
to pretend they know things when they don't know things,
or why would we be where we are?
To pretend they're not a mess when they are a mess.
And I will tell you a very funny story.
On my way here on the airplane, I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane.
And all these men, literally at least 10 men,
were in their little seats watching chick flicks.
And they were all alone, and I thought, "This is the secret life of men."
(Laughter)
to many, many countries,
and I've seen, if we do what we do to the girl inside us
then obviously it's horrific to think
what we do to girls in the world.
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday,
and Kavita about what we do to girls.
But I just want to say that
I've met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns,
who are literally being treated like ashtrays.
I've seen girls be treated like garbage cans.
I've seen girls who were beaten by their mothers
and brothers and fathers and uncles.
I've seen girls starving themselves to death in America
in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves.
and we keep them illiterate,
or we make them feel bad about being too smart.
We silence them. We make them feel guilty
for being smart. We get them to behave,
to tone it down, not to be too intense.
We sell them, we kill them as embryos,
we enslave them, we rape them.
We are so accustomed to robbing girls
of the subject of being the subjects of their lives
that we have now actually objectified them
and turned them into commodities.
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows.
But I also want to talk about the fact that
if one in eight people on the planet
are girls between the ages of 10 to 24,
they are they key, really, in the developing world,
as well as in the whole world, to the future of humanity.
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages
that keep them where society wants them to be,
including lack of access to healthcare,
education, healthy foods,
labor force participation.
The burden of all the household tasks
usually falls on girls and younger siblings,
which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers.
will, in my belief -- and that's the girl inside us
and the girl in the world -- determine whether
the species survives.
And what I want to suggest is that,
having talked to girls, because I just finished a new book called
"I Am an Emotional Creature: The Secret Life of Girls Around the World,"
I've been talking to girls for five years,
and one of the things that I've seen is true everywhere
is that the verb that's been enforced on girl
is the verb "to please."
Girls are trained to please.
I want to change the verb.
I want us all to change the verb.
I want the verb to be "educate,"
or "activate," or "engage,"
or "confront," or "defy," or "create."
If we teach girls to change the verb
we will actually enforce the girl inside us
and the girl inside them.
of girls I've seen across the planet
who have engaged their girl,
who have taken on their girl in spite of
all the circumstances around them.
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands,
for example, who is demanding that she take a boat
and go around the entire world by herself.
went out and knew that she needed 56 stars
tattooed on the right side of her face.
who lived for a year in a tree
because she wanted to protect the wild oaks.
who I have adopted as my daughter
because her mother was killed. Her mother was a revolutionary.
And this girl, when she was 17 years old,
wore a burqa in Afghanistan,
and went into the stadiums
and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women,
underneath her burqa, with a video.
And that video became the video that went out all over the world
after 9/11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan.
who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank
to say, "End the occupation."
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down
and rolled over by that tank.
in Bukavu, who was impregnated by her rapist.
And she was holding her baby.
And I asked her if she loved her baby.
And she looked into her baby's eyes and she said,
"Of course I love my baby. How could I not love my baby?
It's my baby and it's full of love."
and to move on levels, to me, is mind-blowing.
There is a girl named Dorcas, and I just met her in Kenya.
Dorcas is 15 years old,
and she was trained in self-defense.
A few months ago she was picked up on the street
by three older men.
They kidnapped her, they put her in a car.
And through her self-defense, she grabbed their Adam's apples,
she punched them in the eyes
and she got herself free and out of the car.
I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls,
a house we opened seven years ago
with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio.
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl,
she was female genitally mutilated.
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet,
that what was done to her would not be enforced and done
to other women and girls.
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like,
and what a mutilated vagina looked like.
And in that time she saved many girls. And when we met her
we asked her what we could do for her,
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster."
So, we got her a Jeep. And then she saved 4,500 girls.
And she said, "Well, now, I need a house."
So, seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house
in Narok, Kenya, in the Masai land.
And it was a house where girls could run away,
they could save their clitoris, they wouldn't be cut,
they could go to school.
And in the years that Agnes has had the house,
she has changed the situation there.
She has literally become deputy mayor.
She's changed the rules.
The whole community has bought in to what she's doing.
where she reconciles girls, who have run away, with their families.
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn.
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family
and there's a drought in Kenya.
So cows are dying, and cows are the most
valued possession.
And Jaclyn overheard her father
talking to an old man about
how he was about to sell her for the cows.
And she knew that meant she would be cut.
She knew that meant she wouldn't go to school.
She knew that meant she wouldn't have a future.
She knew she would have to marry that old man, and she was 14.
Jaclyn left her father's house
and she walked for two days, two days
through Masai land.
She slept with the hyenas. She hid at night.
She imagined her father killing her on one hand,
and Mama Agnes greeting her,
with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house.
And when she got to the house she was greeted.
Agnes took her in, and Agnes loved her,
and Agnes supported her for the year.
She went to school and she found her voice,
and she found her identity, and she found her heart.
when she had to go back to talk to her father
about the reconciliation, after a year.
I had the privilege of being in the hut
when she was reunited with her father and reconciled.
In that hut, we walked in,
and her father and his four wives were sitting there,
and her sisters who had just returned because
they had all fled when she had fled,
and her primary mother, who had been beaten
in standing up for her with the elders.
When her father saw her and saw who she had become,
in her full girl self,
he threw his arms around her and broke down crying.
He said, "You are beautiful. You have grown into a gorgeous woman.
We will not cut you.
And I give you my word, here and now,
that we will not cut your sisters either."
"You were willing to sell me for four cows,
and a calf and some blankets.
But I promise you, now that I will be educated
I will always take care of you,
and I will come back and I will build you a house.
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life."
And that is the power of transformation.
I want to close today
with a new piece from my book.
And I want to do it tonight
for the girl in everybody here.
And I want to do it for Sunitha.
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday,
the girls who survive, the girls who can become somebody else.
But I really want to do it for each and every person here,
to value the girl in us,
to value the part that cries,
to value the part that's emotional,
to value the part that's vulnerable,
to understand that's where the future lies.
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts, L.A.
I was asking girls if they like being a girl,
and all the girls were like, "No, I hate it. I can't stand it.
It's all bad. My brothers get everything."
And this girl just sat up and went, "I love being a girl.
I'm an emotional creature!"
(Laughter)
This is for her:
I can feel what you're feeling
as you're feeling inside the feeling before.
I am an emotional creature.
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories
or hard-pressed ideas.
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears.
Oh, I know when your girlfriend's really pissed off,
even though she appears to give you what you want.
I know when a storm is coming.
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air.
I can tell you he won't call back. It's a vibe I share.
I love that I do not take things lightly.
Everything is intense to me,
the way I walk in the street, the way my momma wakes me up,
the way it's unbearable when I lose, the way I hear bad news.
I am connected to everything and everyone. I was born like that.
Don't you say all negative
that it's only only a teenage thing,
or it's only because I'm a girl.
These feelings make me better.
They make me present. They make me ready. They make me strong.
There is a particular way of knowing.
It's like the older women somehow forgot.
I rejoice that it's still in my body.
Oh, I know when the coconut's about to fall.
I know we have pushed the Earth too far.
I know my father isn't coming back,
and that no one's prepared for the fire.
I know that lipstick means more than show,
and boys are super insecure,
and so-called terrorists are made, not born.
I know that one kiss
could take away all my decision-making ability.
(Laughter)
And you know what? Sometimes it should.
This is not extreme. It's a girl thing,
what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open.
not to be so extreme, to be reasonable.
I am an emotional creature.
It's how the earth got made, how the wind continues to pollinate.
You don't tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave.
I am an emotional creature.
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off?
I am your remaining memory.
I can take you back.
Nothing's been diluted.
Nothing's leaked out.
I love, hear me, I love
that I can feel the feelings inside you,
even if they stop my life,
even if they break my heart,
even if they take me off track,
they make me responsible.
incondotional, devotional creature.
And I love, hear me,
I love, love, love being a girl.
Can you say it with me?
I love, I love, love, love
being a girl!
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
What I mean by that is that it's time for architecture
to do things again, not just represent things.
standing on the stage with a shiny silver helmet.
I thought it represented the importance of the architect.
threw the helmet onto my bed,
fell down onto my bed and realized inside
there was an inscription.
(Laughter)
Now, I think that this is a great metaphor
for the state of architecture and architects today.
We are for decorative purposes only.
(Laughter)
We can only blame ourselves. Over the last 50 years
the design and construction industry has gotten much more complex
and has gotten much more litigious.
And we architects are cowards.
So, as we have faced liability,
we have stepped back and back,
So, eventually we have found ourselves
in a totally marginalized position, way over here.
but we're smart cowards.
And so we redefined this marginalized position as the place of architecture.
And we announced, "Hey, architecture, it's over here,
in this autonomous language
we're going to seed control of processes."
And we were going to do something that was horrible for the profession.
We actually created an artificial schism
between creation and execution,
as if you could actually create without knowing how to execute
and as if you could actually execute
without knowing how to create.
And that's when we began to sell the world
that architecture was created by individuals
creating genius sketches.
And that the incredible amount of effort to deliver those sketches
for years and years and years is not only something
to be derided,
but we would merely write it off as
merely execution.
Now I'd argue that that is as absurd as stating
that 30 minutes of copulation is the creative act,
and nine months of gestation,
and, God forbid, 24 hours of child labor
is merely execution.
creation and execution.
And we need to start authoring processes again
instead of authoring objects.
Now, if we do this, I believe we can go back 50 years
and start reinjecting agency,
social engineering, back into architecture.
Now, there are all kinds of things that we architects need to learn how to do,
like managing contracts, learning how to write contracts,
understanding procurement processes,
understanding the time value of money and cost estimation.
into three very pedantic statements.
The first is: Take core positions with your client.
I know it's shocking, right, that architecture would actually say that.
Take joint positions with your client.
This is the moment in which you as the architect
and your client can begin to inject
vision and agency.
But it has to be done together.
And then only after this is done
are you allowed to do this, begin to put forward
architectural manifestations
that manifest those positions.
And both owner and architect alike
are empowered to critique those manifestations
based on the positions that you've taken.
I'd like to call it the lost art of productively losing control.
You do not know what the end result is.
But I promise you, with enough brain power
and enough passion and enough commitment,
you will arrive at conclusions
that will transcend convention,
and will simply be something
that you could not have initially
or individually conceived of.
of simple dumb sketches.
This is the modus operandi that we have today.
We roll 120-foot Spartan,
i.e. our vision, up to our clients' gates of Troy.
And we don't understand why they won't let us in. Right?
Well, how about instead of doing that,
we roll up to the gates something they want.
because of course we all know that inside
of the Trojan Horse were a bunch of people with spears.
So, we can change the metaphor. Let's call the Trojan Horse
the vessel by which
you get through the gate,
get through the constraints of a project.
At which point, you and your client
have the ability to start considering what
you're going to put inside that vessel,
the agency, the vision.
And if you do that, you do that responsibly,
I believe that instead of delivering Spartans,
you can deliver maidens.
If we are so good at our craft
shouldn't we be able to conceive
of an architectural manifestation
that slides seamlessly through
the project's and the client's constraints?
Now, with that in mind, I'm going to show a project
that's very dear to many people in this room--
well, maybe not dear, but certainly close to many people in this room.
And that's a project that is just about to open next week,
the new home for the Dallas Theater Center,
the Dee and Charles Wyly Theatre.
issue, position and architectural manifestation.
Now, the first issue that we faced
was that the Dallas Theater Center
had a notoriety that was beyond what you would expect
of some place outside of the triumvirate
of New York, Chicago and Seattle.
And this had to do with the ambitions of the leadership.
But it also had to do with something rather unusual,
and that was this horrible little building that they'd been performing in.
so important to their renown and their innovation?
Because they could do whatever they wanted to to this building.
When you're on Broadway, you cannot tear the proscenium down.
This building, when an artistic director
wanted to do a "Cherry Orchard" and wanted people
and wanted people to come out of a well on the stage,
they brought a backhoe in, and they simply dug the hole.
Well, that's exciting.
And you can start to get the best artistic directors,
scenic designers and actors from around the country
to come to perform here
because you can do things you can't do elsewhere.
"Hey, we as architects had better not show up
and do a pristine building
that doesn't engender the same freedoms that this
old dilapidated shed provided the company."
The second issue is a nuance of the first.
And that's that the company and the building was multiform.
That meant that they were able to perform,
as long as they had labor
they were able to go between proscenium, thrust, flat floor,
arena, traverse, you name it.
It started to become hard to raise operational costs,
operational budgets.
So, they stopped having inexpensive labor.
And eventually they had to freeze their organization
into something called a bastardized thruscenium.
the ability to move between stage configurations,
had better be able to be done
without relying on operational costs. Alright? Affordably.
The architectural manifestation
was frankly just dumb.
It was to take all the things that are known as front of house and back of house
and redefine them as above house and below house.
what could you possibly gain?"
We created what we like to call superfly.
(Laughter)
Now, superfly, the concept is
you take all the freedoms you normally associate with the flytower,
and you smear them across flytower and auditorium.
Suddenly the artistic director
can move between different stage
and audience configurations.
And because that flytower has the ability to pick up
all the pristine elements, suddenly the rest of the environment
can be provisional. And you can drill, cut, nail, screw
paint and replace,
with a minimum of cost.
that was unexpected.
And that was that it freed up the perimeter of the auditorium
in a most unusual way.
And that provided the artistic director suddenly
the ability to define suspension of disbelief.
So, the building affords artistic directors the freedom
to conceive of almost any kind of activity
underneath this floating object.
But also to challenge the notion of suspension of disbelief
such that in the last act of Macbeth,
if he or she wants you to associate
the parable that you're seeing with Dallas, with your real life,
he or she can do so.
had to do something fairly remarkable.
In fact it really was the clients who had to do it.
They had to make a decision, based on the positions we took
to redefine the budget being from two thirds capital-A architecture
and one-third infrastructure,
to actually the inverse,
two-thirds infrastructure and one-third capital-A architecture.
That's a lot for a client to commit to
before you actually see the fruition of the concept.
But based on the positions,
they took the educated leap of faith to do so.
And effectively we created what we like to call
a theater machine.
to move between a whole series of configurations
at the push of a button and a few stagehands
in a short amount of time.
But it also has the potential
to not only provide multiform but multi-processional sequences.
Meaning: The artistic director
doesn't necessarily need to go through our lobby.
is they hate us architects,
because they say the first thing they have to do,
the first five minutes of any show,
is they have to get our architecture
out of the mind of their patron.
Well now there are potentials of this building
to allow the artistic director
to actually move into the building
without using our architecture.
So, in fact, there is the building, there is what we call the draw.
You're going down into our lobby,
go through the lobby with our own little dangly bits, whether you like them or not,
up through the stair that leads you into the auditorium.
to allow people to move directly from the outside,
in this case suggesting kind of Wagnerian entrance,
into the interior of the auditorium.
And here is the fruition of that in actuality.
These are the two large pivoting doors
that allow people to move directly from the outside, in
or from the inside, out,
performers or audience alike.
this is not something yet the building can do because it takes too long.
But imagine the freedoms
if you could take this further, that in fact you could consider
a Wagnerian entry,
a first act in thrust,
Now that, I would say, is architecture performing.
It is taking the hand of the architect
to actually remove the hand of the architect
in favor of the hand of the artistic director.
This is the flat floor configuration.
You notice that there is no proscenium,
the balconies have been raised up, there are no seats,
the floor in the auditorium is flat.
The balconies come down, you see that the orchestra
begins to have a rake that's frontal towards the end stage,
and the seats come in.
Here you see that the balconies actually have to move out of the way
in order to bring a thrust into the space.
And some of the seats need to actually change their direction,
and change their rake, to allow that to happen.
There you see it's the side balconies for the proscenium.
And there it is in the thrust configuration.
again, we needed a client who was willing to take educational risks.
And they told us one important thing:
"You shall not beta-test."
Meaning, nothing that we do
can we be the first ones to do it.
But they were willing for us to apply technologies
from other areas that already had failsafe mechanisms to this building.
was to use something that we all know as a scoreboard lift.
Now, if you were to take a scoreboard
and drop it on dirt and whiskey,
that would be bad.
If you were not able to take the scoreboard out of the arena
and be able to do the Ice Capades the next night,
that would also be bad.
And so this technology already had all the failsafe mechanisms
and allowed the theater and our client
to actually do this with confidence
that they would be able to change over their configurations at will.
was actually using things that you know from
the stage side of an opera house.
In this case what we're doing is we're taking
the orchestra floor, lifting it up, spinning it,
changing the rake, taking it back to flat floor,
changing the rake again. In essence, you can begin to define
rakes and viewing angles
of people in the orchestra seating, at will.
to thrust configuration.
The proscenium, also. As far as we know this is the first building in the world
in which the proscenium can entirely fly out of the space.
Here you see the various acoustic baffles as well as
the flying mechanisms and catwalks over the auditorium.
And ultimately, up in the flytower,
the scene sets that allow the transformations to occur.
yet affordable configuration.
But we got this other benefit, and that was
the ability of the perimeter to suddenly engage
Dallas on the outside.
Here you see the building in its current state
with blinds closed. This is a trompe l'oeil.
Actually this is not a curtain. These are vinyl blinds
that are integrated into the windows themselves,
again with failsafe mechanisms
that can be lifted such that you can completely demystify,
if you chose, the operations of the theater
going on behind, rehearsals and so forth.
But you also have the ability
to allow the audience to see Dallas,
to perform with Dallas as the backdrop of your performance.
this is an early concept sketch --
take you through kind of a mixture of all these things together.
Effectively you would have something like this.
You would be allowed to bring objects or performers into the performing chamber:
"Aida," their elephants, you can bring the elephants in.
You would be able to expose the auditorium to Dallas
or vice versa, Dallas to the auditorium.
You'd be able to open portions in order to
change the procession,
allow people to come in and out for an intermission,
or to enter for the beginning or the end of a performance.
but they can also be disappeared completely.
The proscenium can fly.
You can bring large objects into the chamber itself.
But most convincingly when we had to confront the idea
of changing costs from architecture to infrastructure,
is something that is represented by this.
And again, this is not all the flexibilities of the building that is actually built,
but at least suggests the ideas.
to go back to a flat floor organization
such that they can rent it out.
Now, if there is anyone here from American Airlines,
please consider doing your Christmas party here.
(Laughter)
That allows the company to raise operational budgets
without having to compete with other venues
with much larger auditoriums.
That's an enormous benefit.
to do totally hermetic,
light-controlled, sound-controlled, great acoustics,
great intimacy Shakespeare,
but can also do Beckett
with the skyline of Dallas sitting behind it.
Here it is in a flat floor configuration.
The theater has been going through its kind of paces.
It's actually beautiful. There was a rock band.
It was very unusual.
Here it is in a thrust configuration.
And last but not least,
you see this already has the ability to create events
in order to generate operational budgets
to overcome the building in fact performing
to allow the company to overcome their biggest problem.
As I said, this can be done with only two people,
and with a minimum amount of time.
This is the first time that actually the changeover was done
and so there is literally thousands of people because
everyone was excited and wanted to be a part of it.
So, in a way try to disregard all the thousands of ants running around.
And think of it being done with just a few people.
Again, just a couple people are required.
(Laughter)
I promise.
Et voila.
This is the AT&T Performing Arts Center's
Dee and Charles Wyly Theater.
There it is at night.
And last but not least the entire AT&T Performing Arts Center.
You can see the Winspear Opera House on the right
and the Dee and Charles Wyly Theater on the left.
architecture actually did something.
But we got to that conclusion
without understanding where we were going,
what we knew were a series of issues that the company
and the client was confronted with.
And we took positions with them, and it was through those positions
that we began to take architectural manifestations
and we arrived at a conclusion that none of us,
really none of us could ever
have conceived of initially or individually.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Can geographic information
make you healthy?
In 2001 I got hit by a train.
My train was a heart attack.
I found myself in a hospital
in an intensive-care ward,
recuperating from emergency surgery.
And I suddenly realized something:
that I was completely in the dark.
I started asking my questions, "Well, why me?"
"Why now?" "Why here?"
"Could my doctor have warned me?"
is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health.
Genetics, lifestyle and environment.
That's going to sort of contain our risks,
and if we manage those risks
we're going to live a good life and a good healthy life.
Well, I understand the genetics and lifestyle part.
And you know why I understand that?
Because my physicians constantly
ask me questions about this.
legal-size forms in your doctor's office?
I mean, if you're lucky enough you get to do it more than once, right?
(Laughter)
Do it over and over again. And they ask you questions
about your lifestyle and your family history,
your medication history, your surgical history,
your allergy history ... did I forget any history?
and I don't think my physicians
really get this part of the equation.
What does that mean, my environment?
Well, it can mean a lot of things.
This is my life. These are my life places.
We all have these.
While I'm talking I'd like you to also be thinking about:
How many places have you lived?
your life thinking about this.
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places.
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work.
And if you're like me, you're in an airplane a good portion of your time
traveling some place.
So, it's not really simple
when somebody asks you, "Where do you live, where do you work,
and where do you spend all your time?
And where do you expose yourselves to risks
that maybe perhaps you don't even see?"
Well, when I have done this on myself,
I always come to the conclusion
that I spend about 75 percent of my time
relatively in a small number of places.
And I don't wander far from that place
for a majority of my time,
even though I'm an extensive global trekker.
I started off in Scranton, Pennsylvania.
I don't know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania,
but this is where I spent my first 19 years
with my little young lungs.
You know, breathing high concentrations here
of sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide
and methane gas,
in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this.
And if you've been in that part of the country,
this is what those piles of burning, smoldering coal waste look like.
and I was going to go to the mid-west.
OK, so I ended up in Louisville, Kentucky.
Well, I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown.
They manufacture plastics. They use large quantities chloroprene
and benzene.
Okay, I spent 25 years, in my middle-age lungs now,
breathing various concentrations of that.
And on a clear day it always looked like this, so you never saw it.
It was insidious and it was really happening.
I would take this job in the West Coast.
And I moved to Redlands California.
Very nice, and there
my older, senior lungs, as I like to call them,
I filled with particulate matter, carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone.
Okay? Almost like the highest in the nation.
Alright, this is what it looks like on a good day.
If you've been there, you know what I'm talking about.
Well, the picture is, there is a huge gap here.
The one thing that never happens in my doctor's office:
They never ask me about my place history.
No doctor, can I remember, ever asking me,
"Where have you lived?"
They haven't asked me what kind of the quality
of the drinking water that I put in my mouth
or the food that I ingest into my stomach.
They really don't do that. It's missing.
Look at the kind of data that's available.
This data's from all over the world --
countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research.
Well, by design, if I wanted to have a heart attack
I'd been in the right places. Right?
So, how many people are in the white?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life
in the white space?
Anybody? Boy you're lucky.
How many have spent it in the red places?
Oh, not so lucky.
There are thousands of these kinds of maps
that are displayed in atlases
all over the world.
They give us some sense of what's going
to be our train wreck.
But none of that's in my medical record.
And it's not in yours either.
He's a colleague. He allowed his cell phone to be tracked
every two hours, 24/7,
365 days out of the year
for the last two years, everywhere he went.
And you can see he's been to a few places around the United States.
And this is where he has spent most of his time.
If you really studied that you might have some clues
as to what Paul likes to do.
Anybody got any clues? Ski. Right.
We can zoom in here, and we suddenly see
that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time.
And all of those black dots are all of the
toxic release inventories
that are monitored by the EPA.
For every community in the United States,
you could have your own personalized map of that.
So, our cell phones can now build a place history.
This is how Paul did it. He did it with his iPhone.
This might be what we end up with.
in front of him and her when we enter that exam room
instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter. Right?
This could be my little assessment.
And he looks at that and he says,
"Whoa Bill,
I suggest that maybe you not decide,
just because you're out here in beautiful California,
and it's warm every day,
that you get out and run at six o'clock at night.
I'd suggest that that's a bad idea Bill,
because of this report."
Okay, number one is, we must teach physicians
about the value of geographical information.
It's called geomedicine. There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now
that are focused on this.
And they're in the early stages of development.
These programs need to be supported,
and we need to teach our future
doctors of the world
the importance of some of the information
I've shared here with you today.
is while we're spending billions and billions
of dollars all over the world
building an electronic health record,
we make sure we put a place history
inside that medical record.
It not only will be important for the physician;
it will be important for the researchers
that now will have huge samples to draw upon.
But it will also be useful for us.
I could have made the decision, if I had this information,
not to move to the ozone capital
of the United States, couldn't I? I could make that decision.
Or I could negotiate with my employer
to make that decision
in the best interest of myself and my company.
this almost 10 years ago.
Just look at that for a minute.
That was what the conclusion
of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about,
was saying that we can explain the geographic variations
that occur in disease, in illness, in wellness,
and how our healthcare system actually operates.
That was what he was talking about
on that quote.
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago.
So, I'd very much like to see us begin to
really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records.
So with that, I'll leave you that
in my particular view of view of health:
Geography always matters.
And I believe that geographic information
can make both you and me very healthy. Thank you.
(Applause)
Right now is the most exciting time
to see new Indian art.
Contemporary artists in India are having a conversation with the world
like never before.
I thought it might be interesting, even for the many long-time
collectors here with us at TED, local collectors,
to have an outside view of 10 young Indian artists
I wish everyone at TED to know.
The central motif of Bharti's practice
is the ready-made store-bought bindi
that untold millions of Indian women apply to their foreheads,
every day, in an act closely associated with
the institution of marriage.
But originally the significance of the bindi
is to symbolize the third eye
between the spiritual world and the religious world.
Bharti seeks to liberate this everyday cliche, as she calls it,
by exploding it into something spectacular.
She also creates life-size fiberglass sculptures, often of animals,
which she then completely covers in bindis,
often with potent symbolism.
She says she first got started with
10 packets of bindis,
and then wondered what she could do with 10 thousand.
really stands at the crossroads of sculpture, painting and installation,
working wonders with fiberglass.
Since Bala himself will be speaking at TED
I won't spend too much time on him here today,
except to say that he really succeeds
at making the invisible visible.
is known for her digital collages,
using Indian comic books called amar chitra kathas
as her primary source material.
These comics are a fundamental way
that children, especially in the diaspora,
learn their religious and mythological folk tales.
I, for one, was steeped in these.
Chitra basically remixes and re-titles
these iconic images
to tease out some of the sexual and gender politics
embedded in these deeply influential comics.
And she uses this vocabulary in her installation work as well.
sculpture, painting and installation.
As you can see, he's heavily influenced
by graffiti and street art,
and his home city of Mumbai is an ever-present element in his work.
He really captures that sense of density
and energy which really characterizes modern urban Bombay.
He also creates phantasmagoric sculptures
made of bones from cast resin.
Here he envisions the carcass
of an autorickshaw he once witnessed burning in a riot.
actually has a studio right here in Mysore.
He's putting a contemporary spin on the miniature tradition.
He creates these fine, delicate images
which he then repeats on a massive scale.
He uses scale to more and more spectacular effect,
whether on the roof of a temple in Singapore,
or in his increasingly ambitious installation work,
here with 192 functioning sewing machines,
fabricating the flags of every member of the United Nations.
builds on her love of comic books and street art
to comment on the roles and expectations
of modern Indian women.
She too mines the rich source material of amar chitra kathas,
but in a very different way than Chitra Ganesh.
In this particular work, she actually strips out the images
and leaves the actual text
to reveal something previously unseen, and provocative.
Kashmir-raised,
and London-trained.
He too is reinventing the miniature tradition.
He creates these opulent tableaus inspired by Hieronymus Bosch,
but also by the Kashmiri textiles of his youth.
He actually applies metallic industrial paints to his work
using porcupine quills to get this rich detailed effect.
since Raqs Media Collective are really
three artists working together.
Raqs are probably the foremost practitioners
of multimedia art in India today,
working across photography, video and installation.
They frequently explore themes of globalization and urbanization,
and their home of Delhi is a frequent element in their work.
Here, they invite the viewer to analyze a crime
looking at evidence and clues embedded
in five narratives on these five different screens,
in which the city itself may have been the culprit.
of contemporary Indian art, Subodh Gupta.
He was first known for creating giant photo-realistic canvases,
paintings of everyday objects,
the stainless steel kitchen vessels and tiffin containers
known to every Indian.
He celebrates these local and mundane objects globally,
and on a grander and grander scale,
by incorporating them into ever more colossal
sculptures and installations.
And finally number 10, last and certainly not least,
who lives and works here in the state of Karnataka,
creates ethereal sculptures and installations
that really marry the organic to the industrial,
and brings, like Subodh, the local global.
These are actually wires wrapped in muslin
and steeped in vegetable dye.
And she arranges them so that the viewer
actually has to navigate through the space,
and interact with the objects.
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work.
She also explores themes of consumerism,
and the environment, such as in this work,
where these basket-like objects look organic and woven,
and are woven,
but with the strips of steel, salvaged from cars
that she found in a Bangalore junkyard.
But I can only hope I've whet your appetite
to go out and see and learn more
about the amazing things that are happening in art in India today.
Thank you very much for looking and listening.
(Applause)
This is actually a painting
that hangs at the Countway Library at Harvard Medical School.
And it shows the first time an organ was ever transplanted.
In the front, you see, actually, Joe Murray
getting the patient ready for the transplant,
while in the back room you see Hartwell Harrison,
the Chief of Urology at Harvard,
actually harvesting the kidney.
The kidney was indeed the first organ
ever to be transplanted to the human.
55 years ago.
Yet we're still dealing with a lot of the same challenges
as many decades ago.
Certainly many advances, many lives saved.
But we have a major shortage of organs.
In the last decade the number of patients
waiting for a transplant has doubled.
While, at the same time, the actual number of transplants
has remained almost entirely flat.
That really has to do with our aging population.
We're just getting older.
Medicine is doing a better job
of keeping us alive.
But as we age, our organs tend to fail more.
not just for organs but also for tissues.
Trying to replace pancreas,
trying to replace nerves that can help us with Parkinson's.
These are major issues.
This is actually a very stunning statistic.
Every 30 seconds
a patient dies from diseases
that could be treated with tissue regeneration or replacement.
So, what can we do about it?
We've talked about stem cells tonight.
That's a way to do it.
But still ways to go to get stem cells into patients,
in terms of actual therapies for organs.
Wouldn't it be great if we could actually harness the power
of our bodies, to actually heal ourselves?
It's not really that foreign of a concept, actually;
it happens on the Earth every day.
This is actually a picture of a salamander.
Salamanders have this amazing capacity to regenerate.
You see here a little video.
This is actually a limb injury in this salamander.
And this is actually real photography,
timed photography, showing how that limb regenerates
in a period of days.
You see the scar form.
And that scar actually grows out
a new limb.
Why can't we? Why can't humans regenerate?
Actually, we can regenerate.
Your body has many organs
and every single organ in your body
has a cell population
that's ready to take over at the time of injury. It happens every day.
As you age, as you get older.
Your bones regenerate every 10 years.
Your skin regenerates every two weeks.
So, your body is constantly regenerating.
The challenge occurs when there is an injury.
At the time of injury or disease,
the body's first reaction
is to seal itself off from the rest of the body.
It basically wants to fight off infection,
and seal itself, whether it's organs inside your body,
or your skin, the first reaction
is for scar tissue to move in,
to seal itself off from the outside.
One of the ways that we do that
is actually by using smart biomaterials.
How does this work? Well, on the left side here
you see a urethra which was injured.
This is the channel that connects the bladder to the outside of the body.
And you see that it is injured.
We basically found out that you can use these smart biomaterials
that you can actually use as a bridge.
If you build that bridge, and you close off
from the outside environment,
then you can create that bridge, and cells
that regenerate in your body,
can then cross that bridge, and take that path.
It's actually a smart biomaterial
that we used, to actually treat this patient.
This was an injured urethra on the left side.
We used that biomaterial in the middle.
And then, six months later on the right-hand side
you see this reengineered urethra.
Turns out your body can regenerate,
but only for small distances.
The maximum efficient distance for regeneration
is only about one centimeter.
So, we can use these smart biomaterials
but only for about one centimeter
to bridge those gaps.
What do we do now,
if you have injury for larger organs?
What do we do when we have injuries
for structures which are much larger
than one centimeter?
Then we can start to use cells.
The strategy here, is if a patient comes in to us
with a diseased or injured organ,
you can take a very small piece of tissue from that organ,
less than half the size of a postage stamp,
you can then tease that tissue apart,
and look at its basic components,
the patient's own cells,
you take those cells out,
grow and expand those cells outside the body in large quantities,
and then we then use scaffold materials.
or your shirt, but actually
these materials are fairly complex
and they are designed to degrade once inside the body.
It disintegrates a few months later.
It's acting only as a cell delivery vehicle.
It's bringing the cells into the body. It's allowing
the cells to regenerate new tissue,
and once the tissue is regenerated the scaffold goes away.
This is actually showing a piece of muscle and how we go through
the structures to actually engineer the muscle.
We take the cells, we expand them,
we place the cells on the scaffold,
and we then place the scaffold back into the patient.
But actually, before placing the scaffold into the patient,
we actually exercise it.
We want to make sure that we condition
this muscle, so that it knows what to do
once we put it into the patient.
That's what you're seeing here. You're seeing
this muscle bio-reactor
actually exercising the muscle back and forth.
the muscle.
What about other structures?
This is actually an engineered blood vessel.
Very similar to what we just did, but a little bit more complex.
Here we take a scaffold,
and we basically -- scaffold can be like a piece of paper here.
And we can then tubularize this scaffold.
And what we do is we, to make a blood vessel, same strategy.
A blood vessel is made up of two different cell types.
We take muscle cells, we paste,
or coat the outside with these muscle cells,
very much like baking a layer cake, if you will.
You place the vascular blood vessel lining cells on the inside.
You now have your fully seeded scaffold.
You're going to place this in an oven-like device.
It has the same conditions as a human body,
37 degrees centigrade,
95 percent oxygen.
You then exercise it, as what you saw on that tape.
This is actually the artery that goes from your neck to your brain.
And this is an X-ray showing you
the patent, functional blood vessel.
More complex structures
such as blood vessels, urethras, which I showed you,
they're definitely more complex
because you're introducing two different cell types.
But they are really acting mostly as conduits.
You're allowing fluid or air to go through
at steady states.
They are not nearly as complex as hollow organs.
Hollow organs have a much higher degree of complexity,
because you're asking these organs to act on demand.
Same strategy, we take a very small piece of the bladder,
less than half the size of a postage stamp.
We then tease the tissue apart
into its two individual cell components,
muscle, and these bladder specialized cells.
We grow the cells outside the body in large quantities.
It takes about four weeks to grow these cells from the organ.
We then take a scaffold that we shape like a bladder.
We coat the inside with these bladder lining cells.
We coat the outside with these muscle cells.
We place it back into this oven-like device.
From the time you take that piece of tissue, six to eight weeks later
you can put the organ right back into the patient.
The material is actually being coated with the cells.
When we did the first clinical trial for these patients
we actually created the scaffold specifically for each patient.
We brought patients in,
six to eight weeks prior to their scheduled surgery, did X-rays,
and we then composed a scaffold specifically for that patient's size
pelvic cavity.
For the second phase of the trials
we just had different sizes, small, medium, large and extra-large.
(Laughter)
It's true.
And I'm sure everyone here wanted an extra-large. Right?
(Laughter)
than the other structures.
But there are other hollow organs that have added complexity to it.
This is actually a heart valve, which we engineered.
And the way you engineer this heart valve is the same strategy.
We take the scaffold, we seed it with cells,
and you can now see here, the valve leaflets opening and closing.
We exercise these prior to implantation.
Same strategy.
For solid organs, they're more complex
because you're using a lot more cells per centimeter.
This is actually a simple solid organ like the ear.
It's now being seeded with cartilage.
That's the oven-like device;
once it's coated it gets placed there.
And then a few weeks later we can take out the cartilage scaffold.
These are being layered, one layer at a time,
first the bone, we fill in the gaps with cartilage.
We then start adding the muscle on top.
And you start layering these solid structures.
Again, fairly more complex organs,
but by far, the most complex solid organs
are actually the vascularized, highly vascularized,
a lot of blood vessel supply,
organs such as the heart,
the liver, the kidneys.
This is actually an example -- several strategies
to engineer solid organs.
And instead of using ink, we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge --
we just use cells.
This is actually your typical desktop printer.
It's actually printing this two chamber heart,
one layer at a time.
You see the heart coming out there. It takes about 40 minutes to print,
and about four to six hours later
you see the muscle cells contract.
(Applause)
This technology was developed by Tao Ju, who worked at our institute.
And this is actually still, of course, experimental,
not for use in patients.
is actually to use decellularized organs.
We actually take donor organs,
organs that are discarded,
and we then can use very mild detergents
to take all the cell elements out of these organs.
So, for example on the left panel,
top panel, you see a liver.
We actually take the donor liver,
we use very mild detergents,
and we, by using these mild detergents, we take all the cells
out of the liver.
it feels like a liver,
we can hold it like a liver,
it looks like a liver, but it has no cells.
All we are left with
is the skeleton, if you will, of the liver,
all made up of collagen,
a material that's in our bodies, that will not reject.
We can use it from one patient to the next.
We then take this vascular structure
and we can prove that we retain the blood vessel supply.
We're actually injecting contrast into the organ.
Now you can see it start. We're injecting the contrast into the organ
into this decellularized liver.
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact.
We then take the cells, the vascular cells,
blood vessel cells, we perfuse the vascular tree
with the patient's own cells.
We perfuse the outside of the liver
with the patient's own liver cells.
And we can then create functional livers.
And that's actually what you're seeing.
This is still experimental. But we are able to actually reproduce the functionality
of the liver structure, experimentally.
as I talked to you about the first painting that you saw,
the first slide I showed you,
90 percent of the patients on the transplant wait list
are waiting for a kidney, 90 percent.
So, another strategy we're following
is actually to create wafers
that we stack together, like an accordion, if you will.
So, we stack these wafers together, using the kidney cells.
And then you can see these miniature kidneys that we've engineered.
They are actually making urine.
Again, small structures, our challenge is how to make them larger,
and that is something we're working on
right now at the institute.
One of the things that I wanted to summarize for you then
is what is a strategy that we're going for in regenerative medicine.
we really would like to use smart biomaterials
that we can just take off the shelf
and regenerate your organs.
We are limited with distances right now,
but our goal is actually to increase those distances over time.
If we cannot use smart biomaterials,
then we'd rather use your very own cells.
We can take cells from you,
create the structure, put it right back into you, they will not reject.
And if possible, we'd rather use the cells from your very specific organ.
If you present with a diseased wind pipe
we'd like to take cells from your windpipe.
If you present with a diseased pancreas
we'd like to take cells from that organ.
which already know that those are the cell types you want.
A windpipe cell already knows it's a windpipe cell.
We don't need to teach it to become another cell type.
So, we prefer organ-specific cells.
And today we can obtain cells from most every organ in your body,
except for several which we still need stem cells for,
like heart, liver, nerve and pancreas.
And for those we still need stem cells.
If we cannot use stem cells from your body
then we'd like to use donor stem cells.
And we prefer cells that will not reject
and will not form tumors.
published on two years ago,
stem cells from the amniotic fluid,
and the placenta, which have those properties.
So, at this point, I do want to tell you that
some of the major challenges we have.
You know, I just showed you this presentation, everything looks so good,
everything works. Actually no,
these technologies really are not that easy.
Some of the work you saw today
was performed by over 700 researchers
at our institute across a 20-year time span.
Once you get the formula right you can replicate it.
But it takes a lot to get there.
So, I always like to show this cartoon.
This is how to stop a runaway stage.
And there you see the stagecoach driver,
and he goes, on the top panel,
He goes A, B, C, D, E, F.
He finally stops the runaway stage.
And those are usually the basic scientists,
The bottom is usually the surgeons.
(Laughter)
I'm a surgeon so that's not that funny.
(Laughter)
And what I mean by that is that anytime we've launched one of these technologies
to the clinic,
we've made absolutely sure that we do everything we can
in the laboratory before we ever
launch these technologies to patients.
And when we launch these technologies to patients
we want to make sure that we ask ourselves a very tough question.
Are you ready to place this in your own loved one, your own child,
your own family member, and then we proceed.
Because our main goal, of course,
is first, to do no harm.
It's a five second clip of a patient
who received one of the engineered organs.
We started implanting some of these structures
over 14 years ago.
So, we have patients now walking around with organs,
engineered organs, for over 10 years, as well.
I'm going to show a clip of one young lady.
She had a spina bifida defect, a spinal cord abnormality.
She did not have a normal bladder. This is a segment from CNN.
We are just taking five seconds.
This is a segment that Sanjay Gupta actually took care of.
that I was going to have like, an accident or something.
And now I can just go and
go out with my friends,
go do whatever I want.
is a single promise.
And that is really very simple,
to make our patients better.
Thank you for your attention.
(Applause)
In 2008, Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar.
Millions of people were in severe need of help.
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area.
But there were no maps, no maps of roads,
no maps showing hospitals, no way for help to reach the cyclone victims.
it is hard to believe
that as of 2005, only 15 percent of the world
was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail.
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem
that the majority of the world's populous faces:
not having detailed maps.
At Google, 40 volunteers
used a new software
to map 120,000 kilometers of roads,
3,000 hospitals, logistics and relief points.
And it took them four days.
The new software they used? Google Mapmaker.
to map what we know locally.
People have used this software
to map everything from roads to rivers,
from schools to local businesses,
and video stores to the corner store.
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto
recognized that the key to economic liftoff
for most developing countries
is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land.
For example, a trillion dollars
of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone.
thousands of users in 170 countries
have mapped millions of pieces of information,
and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable.
And this was made possible by
the power of passionate users everywhere.
being created by users right now.
So, as we speak, people are mapping the world
in these 170 countries.
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal.
And, closer to home, Chalua, an N.G. road in Bangalore.
gesture recognition, and machine learning.
This is a victory of thousands of users,
in hundreds of cities,
one user, one edit at a time.
of our unmapped planet.
Welcome to the new world.
(Applause)
I also try to challenge myself
to do things that doctors say are not possible.
And it ended up being so much fun
The next one is I froze myself in a block of ice
for three days and three nights in New York City.
The one after that, I stood on top of a hundred-foot pillar
for 36 hours.
I began to hallucinate so hard
In London I lived in a glass box for 44 days
with nothing but water.
It was, for me, one of the most difficult things I'd ever done,
There was so many skeptics, especially the press in London,
I was obsessed with Houdini and his underwater challenges.
So, I began, early on, competing against the other kids,
you know, five times, while I stayed under on one breath.
By the time I was a teenager,
I was able to hold my breath for three minutes and 30 seconds.
When the rescue workers came,
they resuscitated him and there was no brain damage.
As a magician, I think everything is possible.
And I think if something is done by one person,
it can be done by others.
there must be a way that I could do it.
So, I took that as a challenge, basically.
hoping my core temperature would start to drop.
"I want to hold my breath for a really long time. How could it be done?"
And he said, "David, you're a magician,
create the illusion of not breathing, it will be much easier."
with a balloon duct-taped to it,
that he thought we could put inside of me,
and somehow be able to circulate the air and rebreathe
with this thing in me.
So, that clearly wasn't going to work.
There is a chemical that's called perflubron.
So, I got my hands on that chemical,
filled the sink up with it, and stuck my face in the sink
It's basically like trying to breathe, as a doctor said,
while having an elephant standing on your chest.
So, that idea disappeared.
and have a surgery where it was a tube going into my artery,
and then appear to not breathe while they were oxygenating my blood?
Which was another insane idea, obviously.
You know, because they go down for four minutes on one breath.
That's holding your breath as long as you can
in one place without moving.
That was the one that I studied.
you should never move at all; that wastes energy.
And I learned how to slow my heart rate down.
I had to remain perfectly still and just relax
And then I learned how to purge.
Purging is basically hyperventilating.
And you're really ridding your body of CO2.
So, when you hold your breath, it's infinitely easier.
Then I learned that you have to take a huge breath,
and just hold and relax and never let any air out,
I would wake up and the first thing that I would do
is I would hold my breath
So, basically what that means is I would purge,
I'd breathe really hard for a minute.
And I would hold, immediately after, for five and a half minutes.
At the end of that you're completely fried, your brain.
You feel like you're walking around in a daze.
And you have these awful headaches.
Basically, I'm not the best person to talk to when I'm doing that stuff.
His name is Tom Sietas.
And this guy is perfectly built for holding his breath.
He's six foot four. He's 160 pounds.
In four months of training,
I wanted to try holding my breath everywhere.
I wanted to try it in the most extreme situations
held by Tom Sietas, that guy with the whale lungs I told you about.
I assumed that I could put a water tank at Lincoln Center
and if I stayed there a week not eating,
which I was sure would help me hold my breath
longer than I had been able to do it.
Two days before my big breath-hold attempt, for the record,
the producers of my television special
Because of the movement, I was wasting oxygen.
And by seven minutes and 30 seconds,
I had failed on every level.
and hold my breath longer than any human being ever had.
Oprah gave me four months to prepare and train.
Every morning, again, after getting out of that tent,
your brain is completely wiped out.
My first attempt on pure O2, I was able to go up to 15 minutes.
and broke his old record.
Then his main competitor went out and broke his record.
Which was three minutes longer than I had prepared.
I wanted to get them to do a piece on it.
but John Tierney flew down
and did a piece on the seriousness of breath-holding.
which is basically the height of a 16 story building,
which is really dangerous; that's how you drown.
I completely trained to get my breath-hold time up
for what I needed to do.
But there was no way to prepare for the live television aspect of it,
being on Oprah.
that they had to strap my feet in to keep me from floating up.
So, I had to use my legs to hold my feet into the straps that were loose,
which we never did before, is there was a heart-rate monitor.
And it was right next to the sphere.
So, every time my heart would beat, I'd hear the beep-beep-beep-beep,
you know, the ticking, really loud.
Which was making me more nervous.
And there was no way to slow my heart rate down.
and while holding my breath, it would drop to 12 beats per minute,
which is pretty unusual.
desperately trying to slow my heart rate down.
I was just sitting there thinking,
"I've got to slow this down. I'm going to fail."
And I was getting more nervous.
And the heart rate just kept going up and up,
all the way up to 150 beats.
that I was not going to be able to make this.
There was no way for me to do it.
to doing this breath-hold thing, if I had cracked early,
it would be a whole show about how depressed I am.
at least then they can pull me out and take care of me and all that.
And I knew that that was blood shunting,
and I started to feel my arm going numb.
And I'm a hypochondriac, and I remember arm numb means heart attack.
So, I started to really get really paranoid.
like this urge to breathe.
And I started having ischemia to the heart.
It would skip a beat.
It would start. It would stop. And I felt all this.
And I was sure that I was going to have a heart attack.
they'd have to jump into the binding and take my feet out
before pulling me up.
And then I realized that I had made it to 16:32.
So, with the energy of everybody that was there,
I decided to keep pushing.
And I went to 17 minutes and four seconds.
so the doctors could use it, once again.
I also didn't want anybody to question it.
I'm walking out of the Apple store,
He said, "If you really held your breath that long,
why'd you come out of the water dry?"
I was like "What?"
that seem impossible.
is pretty simple.
It's practice, it's training, and it's -- (Sobs)
Contagious is a good word.
Even in the times of H1N1, I like the word.
Laughter is contagious. Passion is contagious.
Inspiration is contagious.
We've heard some remarkable stories from some remarkable speakers.
But for me, what was contagious about all of them
was that they were infected by something I call the
"I Can" bug.
In a country of a billion people and some,
why so few?
Is it luck? Is it chance?
Can we all not systematically and consciously
get infected?
So, in the next eight minutes I would like to share with you my story.
I got infected when I was 17,
when, as a student of the design college,
I encountered adults who actually believed in my ideas,
challenged me and had lots of cups of chai with me.
And I was struck by just how wonderful it felt,
and how contagious that feeling was.
I also realized I should have got infected when I was seven.
a lab to prototype and refine a design process
that could consciously infect the mind with the "I Can" bug.
And I uncovered
that if learning is embedded in real-world context,
that if you blur the boundaries between school and life,
then children go through a journey of "aware,"
where they can see the change,
"enable," be changed,
and then "empower," lead the change.
And that directly increased student wellbeing.
Children became more competent,
and less helpless.
But this was all common sense.
common practice looks like at Riverside.
A little background: when my grade five was learning about child rights,
they were made to roll incense sticks,
agarbattis, for eight hours
to experience what it means to be a child laborer.
It transformed them. What you will see is their journey,
and then their utter conviction
that they could go out and change the world.
(Music)
And in two hours, after their backs were broke,
they were changed.
And once that happened,
they were out in the city convincing everybody
that child labor just had to be abolished.
And look at Ragav, that moment when his face changes
because he's been able to understand that he
has shifted that man's mindset.
And that can't happen in a classroom.
So, when Ragav experienced that
he went from "teacher told me,"
to "I am doing it." And that's the "I Can" mindshift.
And it is a process that can be energized and nurtured.
"Okay, making our children good human beings is all very well,
but what about math and science and English?
Show us the grades."
And we did. The data was conclusive.
When children are empowered,
not only do they do good,
they do well, in fact very well,
as you can see in this national benchmarking assessment
taken by over 2,000 schools in India,
Riverside children were outperforming the top 10 schools in India
in math, English and science.
So, on August 15th, Independence Day, 2007,
the children of Riverside set out to infect Ahmedabad.
Now it was not about Riverside school.
It was about all children. So, we were shameless.
We walked into the offices of the municipal corporation, the police,
the press, businesses,
and basically said, "When are you going to wake up
and recognize the potential that resides in every child?
When will you include the child in the city?
Basically, open your hearts and your minds to the child."
Since 2007 every other month
the city closes down the busiest streets for traffic
and converts it into a playground for children and childhood.
Here was a city telling its child, "You can."
A glimpse of infection in Ahmedabad.
Video: [Unclear]
So, the busiest streets closed down.
We have the traffic police and municipal corporation helping us.
It gets taken over by children.
They are skating. They are doing street plays.
They are playing, all free, for all children.
(Music)
And we plan to extend this to other parts of the city.
(Music)
And Ahmedabad got the first child-friendly zebra crossing in the world.
in the future the children will give back to the city.
(Music)
Ahmedabad is known as India's first child-friendly city.
Then 30,000 children in Ahmedabad, and growing.
It was time now to infect India.
So, on August 15th,
again, Independence Day, 2009,
empowered with the same process,
we empowered 100,000 children to say, "I can."
How? We designed a simple toolkit,
converted it into eight languages,
and reached 32,000 schools.
We basically gave children a very simple challenge.
We said, take one idea,
anything that bothers you,
choose one week,
and change a billion lives.
poured in from all over India,
from Nagaland in the east,
to Jhunjhunu in the west,
from Sikkim in the north, to Krishnagiri in the south.
Children were designing solutions for a diverse range of problems.
Right from loneliness to filling potholes in the street
to alcoholism,
and 32 children who stopped 16 child marriages
in Rajasthan.
I mean, it was incredible.
Basically again reaffirming that when adults believe in children
and say, "You can," then they will.
Infection in India.
This is in Rajasthan, a rural village.
KBS: First time, a rally and a street play in a rural school --
unheard of -- to tell their parents why literacy is important.
Look at what their parents says.
We feel so nice that our children can teach us how to read and write.
In the future, I will never doubt my students' abilities.
See? They have done it.
Girl: 581. This house is 581 ...
pretty difficult, but they did it.
First they have cleaned the society, then it will be Hyderabad, and soon India.
that they had so much inside them.
For our auction we have some wonderful paintings for you,
for a very good cause,
the money you give us will be used to buy hearing aids.
Are you ready, ladies and gentlemen? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Girl: Are you ready? Audience: Yes!
Street plays, auctions, petitions.
I mean, they were changing lives.
It was incredible.
So, how can we still stay immune?
How can we stay immune to that passion, that energy, that excitement?
I know it's obvious,
but I have to end with the most powerful symbol of change, Gandhiji.
70 years ago, it took one man
to infect an entire nation
with the power of "We can."
to spread the infection from 100,000 children
to the 200 million children in India?
Last I heard, the preamble still said, "We, the people of India," right?
So, if not us, then who?
If not now, then when?
Like I said, contagious is a good word.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Hi. For those of you who haven't seen dancing bears,
these are the dancing bears.
In 1995, we started working on a two-year investigative research project
to try and find out what was going on.
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted
because of this.
This is the Qalandar community. They are a marginalized Islamic community
who live across India,
and have been in India since the 13th century.
And this is footage from a hidden camera in a button.
And we went in, pretending to be buyers.
And we found this right in this very state, in Karnataka.
And the bear cubs were being harvested from across the country
and being sold and traded.
These were being sold for about 2,000 dollars each,
and they are used for bear paw soup,
and also being trained, later on,
to become dancing bears like the one you just saw.
The couple are barely 18 years old.
They already have four children beside them. You can see them.
And the economy of the family and their livelihood depended on those animals.
So, we had to deal with it in a very practical and sustainable manner.
we found that it's an illegal act.
These guys could go to jail for up to seven years
if they were caught by authorities.
And what they were doing to the bears was really appalling.
It was unacceptable.
The mother bears are usually killed.
The cubs, which are taken, are separated.
Their teeth are basically bashed out with a metal rod.
And they use a red hot iron needle to make a hole through the muzzle.
Now we had to start changing these people and converting them from using that
for a livelihood, to getting something else.
And we were so unsure that this would work.
We weren't sure at all. And we managed to convince him.
And we said, "Okay, here is some seed fund.
Let's see if you can get something else." And we got the bear surrendered
to -- we set up a sanctuary. We have four sanctuaries in India.
And now he sells cool drinks, he's by the highway.
He has a telephone booth.
This is Sadua who came and surrendered his bear.
And now he runs a cattle fodder store and a grain store
near Agra.
Then there was no looking back at all for us.
We gave cycle rickshaws.
We set up carpet-weaving units,
vocational training for the women.
The women were just not allowed to come out of the community
and work with mainstream society. So, we were able to address that.
They only had Islamic education, very little of it.
And they were never allowed to go to school
because they were an extra earning hand at home. So we managed to get education.
So, we sponsor 600 children education programs today.
We were able to ensure brighter futures for these people.
This is what happens to the bears when they come in.
And this is what we turn them into.
We have a veterinary facility in our rescue centers.
So, basically in 2002 there were
1,200 dancing bears.
We rescued over 550 dancing bears.
We've been able to ensure better futures for the people and the bears.
is that next month we will be bringing in
the very last bear of India,
into our rescue center.
(Applause)
And India will no longer have to witness this cruel barbaric practice
which has been here for centuries.
And the people can hold their heads up high.
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past
that they've lived all their lives.
And the beautiful bears can of course live in the wild again.
And there will be no more removing of these bears.
And the children, both humans and bear cubs
can live peacefully. Thank you.
(Applause)

I want you to put off your preconceptions,
your preconceived fears and thoughts about reptiles.
rabid, hippie conservationist,
it's purely a figment of your imagination.
(Laughter)
to be so prolific to actually threaten our own survival.
And I know we've all seen images enough to make us numb,
of the tragedies that we're perpetrating on the planet.
It's not only because we like to drink lots of it,
and its marvelous derivatives, beer, wine, etc.
but for several other reasons as well.
I was smitten by snakes, the same way most kids are
smitten by tops, marbles, cars, trains, cricket balls.
And my mother, brave lady,
was partly to blame,
taking me to the New York Natural History Museum,
buying me books on snakes,
and then starting this infamous career of mine,
which has culminated in
of course, arriving in India 60 years ago,
brought by my mother, Doris Norden,
and my stepfather, Rama Chattopadhyaya.
Two animals, two iconic reptiles
really captivated me very early on.
One of them was the remarkable gharial.
This crocodile, which grows to almost 20 feet long
in the northern rivers,
and this charismatic snake, the king cobra.
What my purpose of the talk today really is,
is to sort of indelibly scar your minds
with these charismatic and majestic creatures.
Because this is what you will take away from here,
a reconnection with nature, I hope.
What you're seeing here is very recently shot images
in a forest nearby here,
of a female king cobra making her nest.
Here is a limbless animal, capable of gathering a huge mound of leaves,
and then laying her eggs inside,
to withstand 5 to 10 [meters of rainfall],
in order that the eggs can incubate over the next 90 days,
and hatch into little baby king cobras.
So, she protects her eggs,
and after three months,
the babies finally do hatch out.
A majority of them will die, of course. There is very high mortality
in little baby reptiles who are just 10 to 12 inches long.
in Karnataka, this state.
And it is a marvelous rain forest.
This first encounter
was kind of like the
Maasai boy who kills the lion to become a warrior.
It really changed my life totally.
And it brought me straight into the conservation fray.
I ended up starting this research
and education station in Agumbe,
which you are all of course invited to visit.
we are trying to gather and learn
virtually everything about the biodiversity
of this incredibly complex forest system,
and try to hang on to what's there,
make sure the water sources are protected and kept clean,
and of course, having a good time too.
You can almost hear the drums
throbbing back in that little cottage where we stay when we're there.
It was very important for us to get through to the people.
And through the children is usually the way to go.
They are fascinated with snakes. They haven't got
that steely thing that you end up
either fearing or hating or despising or loathing them in some way.
They are interested.
And it really works to start with them.
And it actually crawled into somebody's bathroom,
and was hanging around there for two or three days.
The people of this part of India
Now we've caught more than 100 king cobras
over the last three years,
and relocated them in nearby forests.
[it was necessary] for us to actually insert
a small radio transmitter inside [each] snake.
Now we are able to follow them and find out their secrets,
where the babies go after they hatch,
I had the pleasure of being close to this large king cobra
who had caught a venomous pit viper.
And it does it in such a way that it doesn't get bitten itself.
In this case a rather strange and inexplicable
activity happened over the last breeding season,
wherein a large male king cobra actually grabbed a female king cobra,
didn't mate with it, actually killed it and swallowed it.
We're still trying to explain and come to terms with
what is the evolutionary advantage of this.
This is again, something [we were able to see] by virtue of the fact
that we had a radio transmitter in one of the snakes.
This male snake, 12 feet long, met another male king cobra.
It's just a wresting match,
but a remarkable activity.
What's the point of all this?
Well, the king cobra is literally
a keystone species in these rainforests.
And our job is to convince the authorities
that these forests have to be protected.
And this is one of the ways we do it,
by learning as much as we can
about something so remarkable and so iconic in the rainforests there,
in order to help protect trees, animals
and of course the water sources.
which started back in the early '70s,
which was, in fact, a very dynamic time for conservation.
We were piloted, I could say,
by a highly autocratic stateswoman,
but who also had an incredible passion for environment.
And this is the time when Project Tiger emerged.
And, just like Project Tiger,
our activities with the king cobra
is to look at a species of animal
so that we protect its habitat and everything within it.
So, the tiger is the icon.
And now the king cobra is a new one.
are sourced in the Western Ghats,
the chain of hills running along the west coast of India.
It pours out millions of gallons every hour,
and supplies drinking water to at least 300 million people,
and washes many, many babies,
and of course feeds many, many animals,
both domestic and wild,
produces thousands of tons of rice.
Well, basically, we dam it, we pollute it,
we pour in pesticides, weedicides, fungicides.
You drink it in peril of your life.
And the thing is, it's not just big industry.
It's not misguided river engineers
who are doing all this; it's us.
Okay. Now we're going north, very far north.
is where we have our base.
This is the home of the gharial, this incredible crocodile.
It is an animal which has been on the Earth
for just about 100 million years.
It survived even during the time that the dinosaurs died off.
It has remarkable features.
Even though it grows to 20 feet long,
since it eats only fish it's not dangerous to human beings.
It does have big teeth, however,
and it's kind of hard to convince people
if an animal has big teeth, that it's a harmless creature.
and found that gharial were extremely rare.
In fact, if you see the map,
the range of their original habitat
was all the way from the Indus in Pakistan
to the Irrawaddy in Burma.
And now it's just limited to a couple of spots
in Nepal and India.
So, in fact at this point
there are only 200 breeding gharial left in the wild.
So, starting in the mid-'70s
when conservation was at the fore,
we were actually able to start projects which were
basically government supported
to collect eggs from the wild from the few remaining nests
and release 5,000 baby gharial
back to the wild.
And pretty soon we were seeing sights like this.
I mean, just incredible to see bunches of gharial
basking on the river again.
And, sure enough, with all the other pressures on the river,
like sand mining, for example,
very, very heavy cultivation all the way down to the river's edge,
not allowing the animals to breed anymore,
we're looking at
even more problems building up for the gharial,
despite the early good intentions.
Their nests hatching along the riverside
producing hundreds of hatchlings. It's just an amazing sight.
This was actually just taken last year.
But then the monsoon arrives,
and, shoop, they get washed down to their doom.
My pals in the Crocodile Specialist Group of the IUCN,
the [Madras Crocodile Bank], an NGO,
the World Wildlife Fund,
the Wildlife Institute of India, State Forest Departments,
But it's possibly, and definitely not enough.
For example, in the winter of 2007 and 2008,
there was this incredible die-off of gharial, in the Chambal River.
working with Indian vets to try to figure out what was happening.
And we actually looked through
all their organs and tried to figure out what was going on.
And it came down to something called gout,
which, as a result of kidney breakdown
is actually uric acid crystals throughout the body,
and worse in the joints,
which made the gharial unable to swim.
And it's a horribly painful death.
filthy Yamuna river, the sacred Yamuna river.
And I hate to be so ironic and sarcastic about it
but it's the truth. It's just one of the filthiest cesspools you can imagine.
It flows down through Delhi, Mathura, Agra,
and gets just about every bit of effluent you can imagine.
So, it seemed that the toxin that was killing the gharial
was something in the food chain,
something in the fish they were eating.
And, you know, once a toxin is in the food chain
everything is affected, including us.
In order to try to answer some of these questions,
we again turn to technology,
to biological technology, in this case,
and actually following their movements. They're being watched
It's a place that's famous to a lot of you who know
about the bandits, the dacoits
who used to work up there. And there still are quite a few around.
But Poolan Devi was one [of them]. Which actually Shekhar Kapur
made an incredible movie, "The Bandit Queen," which I urge you to see.
You'll get to see the incredible [Chambal] landscape as well.
This is one of the last repositories of the
Ganges river dolphin,
various species of turtles,
thousands of migratory birds,
and fishing is causing problems like this.
And now [these] new elements of human intolerance
for river creatures like the gharial
means that if they don't drown in the net,
then they simply cut their beaks off.
Animals like the Ganges river dolphin
which is just down to a few left,
and it is also critically endangered.
Because we are all dependent on these water sources.
So, we all know about the Narmada river,
the tragedies of dams, the tragedies of huge projects
which displace people and wreck river systems
without providing livelihoods.
And development just basically going berserk,
for a double figure growth index, basically.
So, we're not sure where this story is going to end,
whether it's got a happy or sad ending.
And climate change is certainly going
to turn all of our theories and predictions on their heads.
We're still working hard at it.
We've got a lot of a good team of people working up there.
the folks in power,
they're up in their bungalows and so on in Delhi,
in the city capitals. They are all supplied with plenty of water. It's cool.
But out on the rivers there are still millions of people
who are in really bad shape.
And it's a bleak future for them.
So, we have our Ganges and Yamuna cleanup project.
So, people talk about political will.
But if you stroll down to the Yamuna
or to the Gomati in Lucknow,
or to the Adyar river in Chennai,
or the Mula-Mutha river in Pune,
just see what we're capable of doing to a river. It's sad.
that we can do it.
The corporates, the artists, the wildlife nuts,
the good old everyday folks
can actually bring these rivers back.
And the final word is
that there is a king cobra looking over our shoulders.
And there is a gharial looking at us from the river.
And these are powerful water totems.
And they are going to disturb our dreams until we do the right thing.
Namaste.
(Applause)
You know, most people are terrified of snakes.
And there might be quite a few people here who would be
very glad to see the last king cobra bite the dust.
Do you have those conversations with people?
How do you really get them to care?
I guess you could say. I don't say that snakes are huggable exactly.
It's not like the teddy bear.
going "Ssssss!" like that, they say, "My god,
look at that angry, dangerous creature."
I look at it as a creature who is totally frightened
of something so dangerous as a human being.
And that is the truth. And that's what I try to get out.
(Applause)
You were saying that that hasn't been filmed before.
As I said, it's just like a little snack for him, you know?
Usually they eat larger snakes like rat snakes,
or even cobras.
But this guy who we're following right now is in the deep jungle.
Whereas other king cobras
very often come into the human interface,
you know, the plantations, to find big rat snakes and stuff.
he's from Maharashtra, he said, "I think he's after the nusha."
(Laughter)
Now, the nusha means the high.
Whenever he eats the pit viper he gets this little venom rush.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Something called the Danish Twin Study
established that only about 10 percent
of how long the average person lives,
within certain biological limits, is dictated by our genes.
The other 90 percent is dictated by our lifestyle.
So the premise of Blue Zones: if we can find the
optimal lifestyle of longevity
we can come up with a de facto formula
for longevity.
of longevity is, they probably couldn't tell you.
They've probably heard of the South Beach Diet, or the Atkins Diet.
You have the USDA food pyramid.
There is what Oprah tells us.
There is what Doctor Oz tells us.
around what really helps us live longer better.
Should you be running marathons or doing yoga?
Should you eat organic meats
or should you be eating tofu?
When it comes to supplements, should you be taking them?
How about these hormones or resveratrol?
And does purpose play into it?
Spirituality? And how about how we socialize?
was to team up with National Geographic,
and the National Institute on Aging,
to find the four demographically confirmed areas
that are geographically defined.
And then bring a team of experts in there
to methodically go through exactly what these people do,
to distill down the cross-cultural distillation.
But first I'd like to debunk some common myths
when it comes to longevity.
And the first myth is if you try really hard
you can live to be 100.
False.
The problem is, only about one out of 5,000 people
in America live to be 100.
Your chances are very low.
Even though it's the fastest growing demographic in America,
it's hard to reach 100.
The problem is
that we're not programmed for longevity.
We are programmed for something called
procreative success.
I love that word.
It reminds me of my college days.
the age where you have children
and then another generation, the age when your children have children.
After that the effect of evolution
completely dissipates.
If you're a mammal, if you're a rat
or an elephant, or a human, in between, it's the same story.
So to make it to age 100, you not only have to have
had a very good lifestyle, you also have to have won
the genetic lottery.
there are treatments that can help slow,
reverse, or even stop aging.
False.
When you think of it, there is 99 things that can age us.
Deprive your brain of oxygen for just a few minutes,
those brain cells die, they never come back.
Play tennis too hard, on your knees, ruin your cartilage,
the cartilage never comes back.
Our arteries can clog. Our brains can gunk up with plaque,
and we can get Alzheimer's.
There is just too many things to go wrong.
trillion with a "T." We're talking national debt numbers here.
(Laughter)
Those cells turn themselves over once every eight years.
And every time they turn themselves over
there is some damage. And that damage builds up.
And it builds up exponentially.
It's a little bit like the days when we all had
Beatles albums or Eagles albums
and we'd make a copy of that on a cassette tape,
and let our friends copy that cassette tape,
and pretty soon, with successive generations
that tape sounds like garbage.
Well, the same things happen to our cells.
That's why a 65-year-old person
is aging at a rate of about
125 times faster
than a 12-year-old person.
to slow your aging or stop your aging,
what am I doing here?
Well, the fact of the matter is
the best science tells us that the capacity of the human body,
my body, your body,
is about 90 years,
a little bit more for women.
But life expectancy in this country
is only 78.
So somewhere along the line,
we're leaving about 12 good years on the table.
These are years that we could get.
And research shows that they would be years largely free of chronic disease,
heart disease, cancer and diabetes.
is to look at the cultures around the world
that are actually experiencing them,
areas where people are living to age 100
at rates up to 10 times greater than we are,
areas where the life expectancy
is an extra dozen years,
the rate of middle age mortality is a fraction
of what it is in this country.
off the coast of Italy, on the island of Sardinia.
And not the entire island, the island is about 1.4 million people,
but only up in the highlands, an area called the Nuoro province.
And here we have this area where men live the longest,
about 10 times more centenarians than we have here in America.
And this is a place where people not only reach age 100,
they do so with extraordinary vigor.
Places where 102 year olds still ride their bike to work,
chop wood, and can beat a guy 60 years younger than them.
(Laughter)
It's actually a Bronze Age culture that's been isolated.
Because the land is so infertile,
they largely are shepherds,
which occasions regular, low-intensity physical activity.
Their diet is mostly plant-based,
accentuated with foods that they can carry into the fields.
They came up with an unleavened whole wheat bread
called carta musica made out of durum wheat,
a type of cheese made from grass-fed animals
so the cheese is high in Omega-3 fatty acids
instead of Omega-6 fatty acids from corn-fed animals,
and a type of wine that has three times the level
of polyphenols than any known wine in the world.
It's called Cannonau.
in the way that they organize their society.
And one of the most salient elements of the Sardinian society
is how they treat older people.
You ever notice here in America, social equity
seems to peak at about age 24?
Just look at the advertisements.
Here in Sardinia, the older you get
the more equity you have,
the more wisdom you're celebrated for.
You go into the bars in Sardinia,
instead of seeing the Sports Illustrated swimsuit calendar,
you see the centenarian of the month calendar.
to keep them close to the family --
it imparts about four to six years of extra life expectancy --
research shows it's also good for the children of those families,
who have lower rates of mortality and lower rates of disease.
That's called the grandmother effect.
on the other side of the planet,
about 800 miles south of Tokyo,
on the archipelago of Okinawa.
Okinawa is actually 161 small islands.
And in the northern part of the main island,
this is ground zero for world longevity.
This is a place where the oldest living female population is found.
It's a place where people have the longest disability-free
life expectancy in the world.
They have what we want.
They live a long time, and tend to die in their sleep,
very quickly,
and often, I can tell you, after sex.
Five times as many centenarians as we have in America.
One fifth the rate of colon and breast cancer,
big killers here in America.
And one sixth the rate of cardiovascular disease.
And the fact that this culture has yielded these numbers
suggests strongly they have something to teach us.
What do they do?
Once again, a plant-based diet,
full of vegetables with lots of color in them.
And they eat about eight times as much tofu
as Americans do.
They have all kinds of little strategies
to keep from overeating,
which, as you know, is a big problem here in America.
A few of the strategies we observed:
they eat off of smaller plates, so they tend to eat fewer calories at every sitting.
Instead of serving family style,
where you can sort of mindlessly eat as you're talking,
they serve at the counter, put the food away,
and then bring it to the table.
which I think is the greatest sort of diet suggestion ever invented.
It was invented by Confucius.
And that diet is known as the Hara, Hatchi, Bu diet.
It's simply a little saying these people say before their meal
to remind them to stop eating when their stomach is [80] percent full.
It takes about a half hour for that full feeling
to travel from your belly to your brain.
And by remembering to stop at 80 percent
it helps keep you from doing that very thing.
that we can associate with longevity.
We know that isolation kills.
Fifteen years ago, the average American had three good friends.
We're down to one and half right now.
If you were lucky enough to be born in Okinawa,
you were born into a system where you
automatically have a half a dozen friends
with whom you travel through life.
They call it a Moai. And if you're in a Moai
you're expected to share the bounty if you encounter luck,
and if things go bad,
child gets sick, parent dies,
you always have somebody who has your back.
This particular Moai, these five ladies
have been together for 97 years.
Their average age is 102.
we've divided our adult life up into two sections.
There is our work life,
where we're productive.
And then one day, boom, we retire.
And typically that has meant
retiring to the easy chair,
or going down to Arizona to play golf.
In the Okinawan language there is not even
a word for retirement.
Instead there is one word
that imbues your entire life,
and that word is "ikigai."
And, roughly translated, it means
"the reason for which you wake up in the morning."
his ikigai was carrying forth this martial art.
For this hundred-year-old fisherman
it was continuing to catch fish for his family three times a week.
And this is a question. The National Institute on Aging
actually gave us a questionnaire to give these centenarians.
And one of the questions, they were very culturally astute,
the people who put the questionnaire.
One of the questions was, "What is your ikigai?"
They instantly knew why they woke up in the morning.
For this 102 year old woman, her ikigai
was simply her great-great-great-granddaughter.
Two girls separated in age by 101 and a half years.
And I asked her what it felt like
to hold a great-great-great-granddaughter.
And she put her head back and she said,
"It feels like leaping into heaven."
I thought that was a wonderful thought.
wanted me to find America's Blue Zone.
And for a while we looked on the prairies of Minnesota,
where actually there is a very high proportion of centenarians.
But that's because all the young people left.
(Laughter)
So, we turned to the data again.
And we found America's longest-lived population
among the Seventh-Day Adventists
concentrated in and around Loma Linda, California.
Adventists are conservative Methodists.
They celebrate their Sabbath
from sunset on Friday till sunset on Saturday.
A "24-hour sanctuary in time," they call it.
And they follow five little habits
that conveys to them extraordinary longevity,
comparatively speaking.
for the average woman is 80.
But for an Adventist woman,
their life expectancy is 89.
And the difference is even more pronounced among men,
who are expected to live about 11 years
longer than their American counterparts.
Now, this is a study that followed
about 70,000 people for 30 years.
Sterling study. And I think it supremely illustrates
the premise of this Blue Zone project.
It's white, black, Hispanic, Asian.
The only thing that they have in common are a set of
very small lifestyle habits
that they follow ritualistically
for most of their lives.
They take their diet directly from the Bible.
Genesis: Chapter one, Verse [29],
where God talks about legumes and seeds,
and on one more stanza about green plants,
ostensibly missing is meat.
They take this sanctuary in time very serious.
no matter how busy they are, how stressed out they are at work,
where the kids need to be driven,
they stop everything and they focus on their God,
their social network, and then, hardwired right in the religion,
are nature walks.
And the power of this is not that it's done occasionally,
the power is it's done every week for a lifetime.
None of it's hard. None of it costs money.
Adventists also tend to hang out with other Adventists.
So, if you go to an Adventist's party
you don't see people swilling Jim Beam or rolling a joint.
Instead they're talking about their next nature walk,
exchanging recipes, and yes, they pray.
But they influence each other in profound and measurable ways.
Ellsworth Whareham is 97 years old.
He's a multimillionaire,
yet when a contractor wanted 6,000 dollars
to build a privacy fence,
he said, "For that kind of money I'll do it myself."
So for the next three days he was out shoveling cement,
and hauling poles around.
And predictably, perhaps, on the fourth day
he ended up in the operating room.
But not as the guy on the table;
the guy doing open-heart surgery.
At 97 he still does 20 open-heart surgeries every month.
an active cowboy, starts his morning with a swim.
And on weekends he likes to put on the boards,
throw up rooster tails.
Marge is 104.
Her grandson actually lives in the Twin Cities here.
She starts her day with lifting weights.
She rides her bicycle.
And then she gets in her root-beer colored
1994 Cadillac Seville,
and tears down the San Bernardino freeway,
where she still volunteers for seven different organizations.
I've been on 19 hardcore expeditions.
I'm probably the only person you'll ever meet
who rode his bicycle across
the Sahara desert without sunscreen.
But I'll tell you, there is no adventure more harrowing
than riding shotgun with Marge Deton.
"A stranger is a friend I haven't met yet!" she'd say to me.
in these three cultures?
What are the things that they all do?
And we managed to boil it down to nine.
In fact we've done two more Blue Zone expeditions since this
and these common denominators hold true.
And the first one,
and I'm about to utter a heresy here,
none of them exercise,
at least the way we think of exercise.
Instead, they set up their lives
so that they are constantly nudged into physical activity.
These 100-year-old Okinawan women
are getting up and down off the ground, they sit on the floor,
30 or 40 times a day.
Every trip to the store, or to church
or to a friend's house occasions a walk.
They don't have any conveniences.
There is not a button to push to do yard work or house work.
If they want to mix up a cake, they're doing it by hand.
That's physical activity.
That burns calories just as much as going on the treadmill does.
When they do do intentional physical activity,
it's the things they enjoy. They tend to walk,
the only proven way to stave off cognitive decline,
and they all tend to have a garden.
They know how to set up their life in the right way
so they have the right outlook.
The Sardinians pray. The Seventh-Day Adventists pray.
The Okinawans have this ancestor veneration.
But when you're in a hurry or stressed out,
that triggers something called the inflammatory response,
which is associated with everything from Alzheimer's
disease to cardiovascular disease.
When you slow down for 15 minutes a day
you turn that inflammatory state
into a more anti-inflammatory state.
ikigai, like the Okinawans.
You know the two most dangerous years in your life
are the year you're born, because of infant mortality,
and the year you retire.
These people know their sense of purpose,
and they activate in their life, that's worth about seven years
of extra life expectancy.
Instead, these people drink a little bit every day,
not a hard sell to the American population.
(Laughter)
They tend to eat a plant-based diet.
Doesn't mean they don't eat meat, but lots of beans and nuts.
And they have strategies to keep from overeating,
little things that nudge them away from the table at the right time.
They put their families first,
take care of their children and their aging parents.
They all tend to belong to a faith-based community,
which is worth between four and 14
extra years of life expectancy
if you do it four times a month.
And the biggest thing here
is they also belong to the right tribe.
They were either born into
or they proactively surrounded themselves with the right people.
that if your three best friends are obese
there is a 50 percent better chance that you'll be overweight.
So, if you hang out with unhealthy people,
that's going to have a measurable impact over time.
Instead, if your friend's idea of recreation
is physical activity, bowling, or playing hockey,
biking or gardening,
if your friends drink a little, but not too much,
and they eat right, and they're engaged, and they're trusting and trustworthy,
that is going to have the biggest impact over time.
has ever worked for more than two percent of the population.
Exercise programs usually start in January;
they're usually done by October.
When it comes to longevity
there is no short term fix
in a pill or anything else.
But when you think about it,
your friends are long-term adventures,
and therefore, perhaps the most significant thing you can do
to add more years to your life,
and life to your years. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'd like to talk to you today about the human brain,
which is what we do research on at the University of California.
Just think about this problem for a second.
Here is a lump of flesh, about three pounds,
which you can hold in the palm of your hand.
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space.
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity,
ask questions about the meaning of its own existence,
about the nature of God.
It's the greatest mystery confronting human beings:
How does this all come about?
Well, the brain, as you know, is made up of neurons.
We're looking at neurons here.
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain.
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts
with other neurons in the brain.
And based on this, people have calculated
that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity
exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe.
One approach is to look at patients who had lesions
in different part of the brain, and study changes in their behavior.
This is what I spoke about in the last TED.
Today I'll talk about a different approach,
which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain,
and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain.
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain.
by researchers in Italy, in Parma,
by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues,
is a group of neurons called mirror neurons,
which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes.
Now, it turns out there are neurons
which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain,
which have been known for over 50 years.
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action.
For example, if I do that, and reach and grab an apple,
a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire.
If I reach out and pull an object, another neuron will fire,
commanding me to pull that object.
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time.
a subset of these neurons,
maybe about 20 percent of them, will also fire
when I'm looking at somebody else performing the same action.
So, here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something,
but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something.
And this is truly astonishing.
Because it's as though this neuron is adopting
the other person's point of view.
It's almost as though it's performing a virtual reality simulation
of the other person's action.
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation.
Because to imitate a complex act
requires my brain to adopt the other person's point of view.
So, this is important for imitation and emulation.
Well, why is that important?
Well, let's take a look at the next slide.
So, how do you do imitation? Why is imitation important?
Mirror neurons and imitation, emulation.
If you go back in time about [75,000] to 100,000 years ago,
let's look at human evolution, it turns out
that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago.
And that is, there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread
of a number of skills that are unique to human beings
like tool use,
the use of fire, the use of shelters, and, of course, language,
and the ability to read somebody else's mind
and interpret that person's behavior.
All of that happened relatively quickly.
almost three or four hundred thousand years ago,
100,000 years ago all of this happened very, very quickly.
And I claim that what happened was
the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system,
which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people's actions.
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery
by one member of the group, say the use of fire,
or a particular type of tool, instead of dying out,
this spread rapidly, horizontally across the population,
or was transmitted vertically, down the generations.
instead of Darwinian.
Darwinian evolution is slow; it takes hundreds of thousands of years.
A polar bear, to evolve a coat,
will take thousands of generations, maybe 100,000 years.
A human being, a child, can just watch its parent
kill another polar bear,
and skin it and put the skin on its body, fur on the body,
and learn it in one step. What the polar bear
took 100,000 years to learn,
it can learn in five minutes, maybe 10 minutes.
And then once it's learned this it spreads
in geometric proportion across a population.
is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization.
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron,
which is involved in something quite different.
And that is, there are mirror neurons,
just as there are mirror neurons for action, there are mirror neurons for touch.
In other words, if somebody touches me,
my hand, neuron in the somatosensory cortex
in the sensory region of the brain fires.
But the same neuron, in some cases, will fire
when I simply watch another person being touched.
So, it's empathizing the other person being touched.
in different locations. Different neurons for different locations.
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else
being touched in the same location.
So, here again you have neurons
which are enrolled in empathy.
Now, the question then arises: If I simply watch another person being touched,
why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation
merely by watching somebody being touched?
I mean, I empathize with that person but I don't literally feel the touch.
Well, that's because you've got receptors in your skin,
touch and pain receptors, going back into your brain
and saying "Don't worry, you're not being touched.
So, empathize, by all means, with the other person,
but do not actually experience the touch,
otherwise you'll get confused and muddled."
that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron
preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch.
But if you remove the arm, you simply anesthetize my arm,
so you put an injection into my arm,
anesthetize the brachial plexus, so the arm is numb,
and there is no sensations coming in,
if I now watch you being touched,
I literally feel it in my hand.
In other words, you have dissolved the barrier
between you and other human beings.
So, I call them Gandhi neurons, or empathy neurons.
(Laughter)
All that's separating you from him,
from the other person, is your skin.
Remove the skin, you experience that person's touch in your mind.
You've dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings.
And this, of course, is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy,
and that is there is no real independent self,
aloof from other human beings, inspecting the world,
inspecting other people.
You are, in fact, connected not just via Facebook and Internet,
you're actually quite literally connected by your neurons.
And there is whole chains of neurons around this room, talking to each other.
And there is no real distinctiveness
of your consciousness from somebody else's consciousness.
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience.
So, you have a patient with a phantom limb. If the arm has been removed
and you have a phantom, and you watch somebody else
being touched, you feel it in your phantom.
Now the astonishing thing is,
if you have pain in your phantom limb, you squeeze the other person's hand,
massage the other person's hand,
that relieves the pain in your phantom hand,
almost as though the neuron
were obtaining relief from merely
watching somebody else being massaged.
For the longest time people have regarded science
and humanities as being distinct.
C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures:
science on the one hand, humanities on the other;
never the twain shall meet.
So, I'm saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface
allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness,
representation of self,
what separates you from other human beings,
what allows you to empathize with other human beings,
and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization,
which is unique to human beings. Thank you.
(Applause)
So, 120 years ago,
Dr. Röntgen X-rayed his wife's hand.
Quite why he had to pin her fingers to the floor
with her brooch, I'm not sure. It seems a bit extreme to me.
That image was the start of the X-ray technology.
And I'm still fundamentally using the same principles today.
I'm interpreting it in a more contemporary manner.
was of a soda can, which was to promote a brand that we all know,
so I'm not going to do them any favors by showing you it.
But the second shot I did was my shoes I was wearing on the day.
And I do really like this shot, because
it shows all the detritus that's sort of embedded
in the sole of the sneakers.
It was just one of those pot-luck things where you
get it right first time.
this is an X-ray of a bus.
And the bus is full of people.
It's actually the same person. It's just one skeleton.
And back in the '60s,
they used to teach student radiographers
to take X-rays, thankfully not on you and I,
but on dead people.
So, I've still got access to one of these dead people
called Frieda; she's falling apart, I'm afraid,
because she's very old and fragile.
But everyone on that bus is Frieda.
And the bus is taken with a cargo-scanning X-ray,
which is the sort of machine you have on borders,
which checks for contraband and drugs and bombs and things.
So, using large-scale objects
does sort of create drama
because you just don't see X-rays of big things that often.
Technology is moving ahead,
and these large cargo scanner X-rays
that work with the digital system are getting better and better and better.
Again though, to make it come alive
you need, somehow, to add the human element.
And I think the reason this image works, again, is because
Frieda is driving the bulldozer.
(Laughter)
make a pair of men's pants look beautiful.
But I think the process, in itself, shows how exquisite they are.
Fashion -- now, I'm sort of anti-fashion because I
don't show the surface, I show what's within.
So, the fashionistas don't really like me
because it doesn't matter if Kate Moss is wearing it or if I'm wearing it,
it looks the same.
(Laughter)
We all look the same inside, believe me.
The creases in the material and the sort of nuances.
And I show things for really what they are, what they're made of.
I peel back the layers and expose it.
And if it's well made I show it, if it's badly made I show it.
The design comes from within.
It's not just Topshop,
I get some strange looks when I go out getting my props.
Here I was fumbling around in the ladies' underwear department
of a department store, almost got escorted from the premises.
I live opposite a farm. And this was the runt of the litter, a piglet that died.
And what's really interesting is,
if you look at the legs, you'll notice that the bones haven't fused.
And should that pig have grown,
unfortunately it was dead, it would have certainly been dead
after I X-rayed it, with the amount of radiation I used anyway.
(Laughter)
But once the bones had fused together
it would have been healthy.
But I quite love the way it's posed.
Nature is my greatest inspiration.
And to carry on with a theme that we've already touched with
is how nature is related to architecture.
If you look at the roof of the Eden Project,
or the British library, it's all this honeycomb structure.
And I'm sure those architects are inspired,
as I am, by what surrounds us, by nature.
This, in fact, is a Victoria water lily leaf
that floats on the top of a pond.
An amaryllis flower looking really three-dimensional.
Seaweed, ebbing in the tide.
Now, how do I do this, and where do I do this, and all of that sort of thing.
And the door to my X-ray room
is made of lead and steel.
It weighs 1,250 kilograms and the only exercise I get is opening and closing it.
(Laughter)
The walls are 700 millimeters thick of solid dense concrete.
So, I'm using quite a lot of radiation.
A lot more than you'd get in a hospital or a vet's.
And there I am. This is a quite high-powered X-ray machine.
What's interesting really about X-ray really
is, if you think about it, is that that technology
is used for looking for cancer or looking for drugs,
or looking for contraband or whatever.
And I use that sort of technology
to create things that are quite beautiful.
Technology in X-ray where it's life-size processed,
apart from these large cargo-scanning machines,
hasn't moved on enough for the quality of the image
and the resolution to be good enough for what I want to do with it,
which is show my pictures big.
So, I have to use a 1980s drum scanner,
which was designed in the days when everyone shot photographs on film.
They scan each individual X-ray.
And this shows how I do my process of same-size X-rays.
So, this is, again, my daughter's dress.
Still has the tag in it from me buying it,
so I can take it back to the shop if she didn't like it.
But there are four X-ray plates.
You can see them overlapping.
a dress which is this size,
onto something like that which is done in exactly the same process,
you can see that that is a lot of work.
In fact, that is three months solid X-raying.
There is over 500 separate components.
Boeing sent me a 747 in containers.
And I sent them back an X-ray.
(Laughter) I kid you not.
This, unfortunately, is basically two pictures.
One on the extreme right is a photograph of an American footballer.
The one on the left is an x-ray.
But this time I had to use a real body.
Because I needed all the skin tissue to make it look real,
to make it look like it was a real athlete.
So, here I had to use a recently deceased body.
And getting a hold of that was extremely difficult and laborious.
But people do donate their bodies to art and science.
And when they do, I'm in the queue.
So, I like to use them.
(Laughter)
It makes it more organic, more natural.
It's whatever takes my fancy, really.
It's not accurately colored to how it is in real life.
That flower doesn't come in bright orange, I don't think.
But I just like it in bright orange.
And also with something technical, like these are DJ decks,
it sort of adds another level.
It makes a two dimensional image look more three dimensional.
the most technically challenging things to X-ray
are the lightest things, the most delicate things.
To get the detail in a feather,
believe me, if there is anyone out here who knows anything about X-rays,
that's quite a challenge.
I'm now going to show you a short film, I'll step to the side.
The thing in there is very dangerous.
If you touch that, you could possibly die
through radiation poisoning.
In my career I've had two exposures to radiation,
which is two too many, because it stays with you for life.
It's cumulative.
It has human connotations.
The fact that it's a child's toy that we all recognize,
but also it looks like it's a robot,
and it comes from a sci-fi genus.
It's a surprise that it has humanity,
but also man-made, future, alien associations.
And it's just a bit spooky.
The bus was done with a cargo-scanning X-ray machine,
which is used on the borders
between countries, looking for contraband and illegal immigrants.
The lorry goes in front of it. And it takes slices
of X-rays through the lorry.
And that's how this was done. It's actually slice, slice.
It's a bit like a CT scanner in a hospital. Slices.
And then if you look carefully, there is all little things.
He's got headphones on, reading the newspaper,
got a hat on, glasses, got a bag.
So, these little details
help to make it work, make it real.
The problem with using living people is that
to take an X-ray, if I X-ray you, you get exposed to radiation.
So, to avoid that --
I have to avoid it somehow --
is I use dead people.
Now, that's a variety of things, from recently deceased bodies,
to a skeleton that was used by student radiographers
to train in taking X-rays of the human body,
at different densities.
I have very high-tech equipment of gloves, scissors and a bucket.
I will show how the capillary action works, how it feeds,
I'll be able to get all the cells inside that stem.
Because it transfers food from its roots to its leaves.
Look at this monster.
It's so basic. It just grows wild.
That's what I really like about it,
the fact that I haven't got to go and buy it,
and it hasn't been genetically modified at all.
It's just happening.
And the X-ray shows how beautiful nature can be.
Not that that is particularly beautiful
when you look at it with the human eye,
the way the leaves form. They're curling back on each other.
So the X-ray will show the overlaps in these little corners.
The thicker the object, the more radiation it needs,
and the more time it needs.
The lighter the object, the less radiation.
Sometimes you keep the time up, because the time gives you detail.
The longer the exposure goes on for,
the more detail you get.
If you look at this, just the tube,
it is quite bright.
But I could get a bit darker in the tube, but everything else would suffer.
So, these leaves at the edge would start to disappear.
What I like is how hard the edges are,
how sharp.
Yeah, I'm quite pleased with it.
I travel beyond the surface and show
something for what it's worth,
for what it's really made of, how it really works.
But also I find that
I've got the benefit of taking away all the surface,
which is things that people are used to seeing.
I've got the opportunity now to show you
what I'm going to be doing in the future.
This is a commercial application of my most recent work.
And what's good about this, I think, is that it's like a moment in time,
like you've turned around, you've got X-ray vision
and you've taken a picture with the X-ray camera.
Unfortunately I haven't got X-ray vision.
I do dream in X-ray. I see my projects in my sleep.
And I know what they're going to look like in X-ray and I'm not far off.
Well, this year is the 50th anniversary
of Issigonis's Mini, which is one of my favorite cars.
So, I've taken it apart, component by component,
months and months and months of work.
And with this image, I'm going to be displaying
it in the Victoria and Albert Museum
as a light box, which is actually attached to the car.
So, I've got to saw the car in half, down the middle,
not an easy task, in itself.
And then, so you can get in the driver's side, sit down,
and up against you is a wall.
And if you get out and walk around to the other side of the car,
you see a life-sized light box of the car showing you how it works.
and apply it to other sort of iconic things from my life.
Like, my first computer was a big movement in my life.
And I had a Mac Classic. And it's a little box.
And I think that would look quite neat as an X-ray.
I'm also looking to
take my work from the two-dimensional form
to a more three-dimensional form.
And this is quite a good way of doing it.
I'm also working now with X-ray video.
So, if you can imagine, some of these flowers,
and they're actually moving and growing
and you can film that in X-ray, should be quite stunning.
But that's it. I'm done. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Well, I learned a lot of things about ballooning,
especially at the end of these balloon flights
around the world I did with Brian Jones.
When I took this picture,
the window was frozen because of the moisture of the night.
And on the other side there was a rising sun.
So, you see that on the other side of ice
you have the unknown,
you have the non-obvious,
you have the non-seen,
for the people who don't dare
to go through the ice.
who prefer to suffer in the ice they know
instead of taking the risk of going through the ice
to see what there is on the other side.
And I think that's one of the main problems of our society.
We learn, maybe not the famous TED audience,
but so many other people learn,
that the unknown, the doubts,
the question marks are dangerous.
And we have to resist to the changes.
We have to keep everything under control.
Well, the unknown is part of life.
Because in the balloon, like in life,
we go very well in unforeseen directions.
We want to go in a direction,
but the winds push us in another direction, like in life.
And as long as we fight horizontally,
against life, against the winds,
against what's happening to us,
life is a nightmare.
By understanding that the atmosphere
is made out of several different layers of wind
which all have different direction.
So, then, we understand that if we want to change our trajectory,
in life, or in the balloon,
we have to change altitude.
Changing altitude, in life,
that means raising to another psychological, philosophical,
spiritual level.
But how do we do that?
how do we change altitude?
How do we go from the metaphor
to something more practical that we can really
use every day?
Well, in a balloon it's easy, we have ballast.
And when we drop the ballast overboard we climb.
Sand, water, all the equipment we don't need anymore.
And I think in life it should be exactly like this.
very often they believe that pioneers
are the ones who have new ideas.
It's not true.
The pioneers are not the ones who have new ideas,
because new ideas are so easy to have.
We just close our eyes for a minute we all come back
with a lot of new ideas.
No, the pioneer is the one who
allows himself to throw overboard a lot of ballast.
Habits, certainties,
convictions, exclamation marks,
paradigms, dogmas.
And when we are able to do that,
what happens?
Life is not anymore
just one line going in one direction
in one dimension. No.
Life is going to be made out of all the possible lines
that go in all the possible directions
in three dimensions.
to explore this vertical axis.
Of course not just like the atmosphere in the balloon,
but in life itself.
Explore this vertical axis, that means
explore all the different ways to do,
all the different ways to behave, all the different ways to think,
before we find the one that goes in the direction we wish.
This is very practical.
This can be in politics.
This can be in spirituality.
This can be in environment,
in finance, in education of children.
that life is a much greater adventure
if we manage to do politics
without the trench between the left and the right wing.
Because we will throw away these political dogmas.
I deeply believe that we can make much more protection of the environment
if we get rid -- if we throw overboard
this fundamentalism that some of the greens have showed in the past.
And that we can aim for much higher spirituality
if we get rid of the religious dogmas.
Throwing overboard, as ballast, to change our direction.
But actually I had to go around the world in a balloon
to be invited to talk about it.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
It's clear that it's not easy to know which ballast to drop
and which altitude to take. Sometime we need
friends, family members or a psychiatrist.
Well, in balloons we need weather men,
the one who calculate the direction of each layer of wind,
at which altitude, in order to help the balloonist.
But sometimes it's very paradoxical.
the weather man asked us, one day, to fly
quite low, and very slow.
And when we calculated we thought we're never going to make it
around the world at that speed.
So, we disobeyed. We flew much higher, and double the speed.
that I called the weather man,
and I told him, "Hey, guy, don't you think we're good pilots up there?
We fly twice the speed you predicted."
And he told me, "Don't do that. Go down immediately
in order to slow down."
And I started to argue. I said, "I'm not going to do that.
We don't have enough gas to fly so slow."
And he told me, "Yes, but with the low pressure you have on your left
if you fly too fast, in a couple of hours
you will turn left and end up at the North Pole.
(Laughter)
And then he asked me --
and this is something I will never forget in my life --
he just asked me, "You're the good pilot up there.
What do you really want? You want to go very fast
in the wrong direction, or slowly in the good direction?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
This is why you need people with long-term vision.
And this is precisely what fails
in the political visions we have now,
in the political governments.
We are burning, as you heard,
so much energy,
not understanding that such an unsustainable
way of life cannot last for long.
So, we went down actually.
We slowed down. And we went through moments of fears
because we had no idea how the little amount of gas
we had in the balloon
could allow us to travel 45,000 kilometers.
But we were expected to have doubts; we're expected to have fears.
And actually this is where the adventure really started.
it was nice holidays.
We could land anytime and fly back home with an airplane.
In the middle of the Pacific,
when you don't have the good winds, you cannot land,
you cannot go back.
That's a crisis.
That's the moment when you have to wake up
from the automatic way of thinking.
That's the moment when you have to motivate
your inner potential,
your creativity.
That's when you throw out all the ballast,
all the certainties,
in order to adapt to the new situation.
We changed completely our strategy.
And after 20 days we landed successfully in Egypt.
But if I show you this picture
it's not to tell you how happy we were.
It's to show you how much gas was left
in the last bottles.
We took off with 3.7 tons of liquid propane.
We landed with 40 kilos.
I made a promise that the next time I would fly around the world,
it would be with no fuel,
independent from fossil energies,
in order to be safe,
not to be threatened by the fuel gauge.
I had no idea how it was possible.
I just thought it's a dream and I want to do it.
officially in the Air and Space Museum in Washington,
together with the airplane of Charles Lindbergh,
with Apollo 11, with the Wright Brothers' Flyer,
with Chuck Yeager's 61,
I had really a thought then.
I thought, well, the 20th century, that was brilliant.
It allowed to do all those things there.
But it will not be possible in the future any more.
It takes too much energy. It will cost too much.
It will be prohibited
because we'll have to save our natural resources
in a few decades from now.
this pioneering spirit
with something that will be independent from fossil energy?
And this is when the project Solar Impulse
really started to
turn in my head.
And I think it's a nice metaphor also
for the 21st century.
Pioneering spirit should continue, but on another level.
Not to conquer the planet or space,
not anymore, it has been done,
but rather to improve the quality of life.
How can we go through the ice of certainty
in order to make the most incredible a possible thing?
What is today completely impossible --
get rid of our dependency on fossil energy.
from fossil energy in our world,
people will laugh at you, except here,
where crazy people are invited to speak.
(Laughter)
So, the idea is that if we fly around the world
in a solar powered airplane,
using absolutely no fuel,
nobody ever could say in the future
that it's impossible to do it
for cars, for heating systems,
for computers, and so on and so on.
They have flown in the past, but without
saving capabilities, without batteries.
Which means that they have more proven
the limits of renewable energies
than the potential of it.
If we want to show the potential,
we have to fly day and night.
That means to load the batteries during the flight,
in order to spend the night on the batteries,
and fly the next day again.
It has been made, already, on remote controlled
little airplane models, without pilots.
because the public couldn't identify to it.
I think you need a pilot in the plane
that can talk to the universities,
that can talk to students,
talk to politicians during the flight,
and really make it a human adventure.
For that, unfortunately,
four meters wingspan is not enough.
You need 64 meter wingspan.
64 meter wingspan to carry one pilot, the batteries,
flies slowly enough with the aerodynamic efficiency.
Why that? Because fuel is not easy to replace.
That's for sure.
And with 200 square meters of solar power on our plane,
we can produce the same energy
than 200 little lightbulbs.
That means a Christmas tree, a big Christmas tree.
with an airplane that uses
the same amount of energy as a big Christmas tree?
People will tell you it's impossible,
and that's exactly why we try to do it.
We launched the project with my colleague Andre Borschberg
six years ago.
We have now 70 people in the team working on it.
We have gone through the stages of simulation, design,
computing, preparing the construction
of the first prototype.
That has been achieved after two years of work.
Cockpit, propeller, engine.
Just the fuselage here, it's so light.
It's not designed by an artist, but it could be.
50 kilos for the entire fuselage.
Couple of kilos more for the wing spars.
And one month ago we have unveiled it.
You cannot imagine how it is for a team
who has been working six years on it
to show that it's not only a dream and a vision,
it's a real airplane.
A real airplane that we could finally present.
The goal is to take off,
end of this year for the first test,
but mainly next year, spring or summer,
take off, on our own power,
without additional help, without being towed,
climb to 9,000 meters altitude.
The same time we load the batteries,
we run the engines, and when we get at the maximum height,
we arrive at the beginning of the night.
And there, there will be just one goal, just one:
reach the next sunrise before the batteries are empty.
(Laughter)
If our airplane is too heavy,
if the pilot wastes energy,
we'll never make it through the night.
And in our world, if we keep on spoiling,
wasting our energy resources,
if we keep on building things that consume so much energy
that most of the companies now go bankrupt,
it's clear that we'll never give the planet to the next generation
without a major problem.
I don't think it will transport 200 people
in the next years.
But when Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic,
the payload was also just sufficient
for one person and some fuel.
And 20 years later there were 200 people
in every airplane crossing the Atlantic.
and show the example.
A little bit like on this picture here.
This is a painting from Magritte,
in the museum in Holland that I love so much.
It's a pipe, and it's written, "This is not a pipe."
This is not an airplane.
This is a symbol of what we can achieve
when we believe in the impossible,
when we have a team,
when we have pioneering spirit,
and especially when we understand
that all the certainties we have
should be thrown overboard.
is that in the beginning I thought that we would have to fly
around the world with no fuel
in order to have our message been understood.
And more and more, we're invited around the world with Andre
to talk about that project, to talk about the symbol of it,
invited by politicians, invited in energy forums,
in order to show that it's not anymore
completely stupid
to think about getting rid of the dependency
on fossil energies.
through interviews, through meetings,
our goal is to get as many people possible on the team.
The success will not come
if we "just," quote, unquote,
fly around the world in a solar-powered airplane.
No, the success will come
if enough people are motivated
to do exactly the same in their daily life,
save energy, go to renewables.
And this is possible. You know, with the technologies we have today,
we can save between 30 and 50 percent
of the energy of a country in Europe,
and we can solve half of the rest with renewables.
It leaves 25 or 30 percent for
oil, gas, coal, nuclear, or whatever.
This is acceptable.
in this type of spirit
are welcome to be on that team.
You can just go on SolarImpulse.com, subscribe
to just be informed of what we're doing.
But much more, to get advices,
to give your comments, to spread the word
that if it's possible in the air,
of course it's possible in the ground.
we have to know that life will be great,
and the success will be brilliant
if we dare to overcome our fear of the ice,
to go through the obstacle,
to go through the problem, in order to see what there is on the other side.
So, you see, this is what we're doing on our side.
Everyone has his goal, has his dreams,
has his visions.
is which is the ballast
you would like to throw overboard?
Which will be the altitude at which
you would like to fly in your life,
to get to the success that you wish to have,
to get to the point that really belongs to you,
with the potential you have,
and the one you can really fulfill?
Because the most renewable energy we have
is our own potential, and our own passion.
So, let's go for it, and I wish you an excellent adventure
in the wings of the future. Thank you.
(Applause)
Namaste. Salaam.
Shalom. Sat Sri Akal.
Greetings to all of you from Pakistan.
It is often said that we fear that which we do not know.
And Pakistan, in this particular vein, is very similar.
Because it has provoked, and does provoke,
a visceral anxiety in the bellies of many a Western soul,
especially when viewed through the monochromatic lens
of turbulence and turmoil.
But there are many other dimensions to Pakistan.
a series of images captured by some of Pakistan's
most dynamic and young photographers,
that aims to give you an alternative glimpse,
a look inside the hearts and minds
of some ordinary Pakistani citizens.
Here are some of the stories they wanted us to share with you.
I hope that you will be able to see
not just my Taliban-like beard,
but also the richness and color
of my perceptions, aspirations and dreams,
as rich and colorful as the satchels that I sell.
I hope to become a vet when I grow up
so that I can take care of stray cats and dogs
who wander around the streets of the village
that I live near Gilgit, northern Pakistan.
through technicolored glass.
Madame, would you like some of those orange bangles
with the pink polka dots?
And I'm an IDP, an internally displaced person,
from Swat.
Do you see me on the other side of this fence?
Do I matter, or really exist for you?
an up-and-coming model from Lahore.
Do you see me simply smothered in cloth?
Or can you move beyond my veil
and see me for who I truly am inside?
from the Khyber agency.
I have come from a place of intense darkness.
And that is why I want to illuminate the world.
My heart and drum beat as one.
If religion is the opium of the masses,
then for me, music is my one and only ganja.
And the rising tide of India's
spectacular economic growth
has lifted over 400 million
Indians into a buoyant middle class.
But there are still over 650 million Indians,
Pakistanis, Sri Lankans, Bangladeshis, Nepalese,
who remain washed up on the shores of poverty.
it behooves us to transcend our differences,
to celebrate our diversity,
to leverage our common humanity.
Our collective vision at Naya Jeevan,
which for many of you, as you all recognize,
means "new life" in Urdu and Hindi,
is to rejuvenate the lives of millions of low income families
by providing them with affordable access
to catastrophic health care.
Indeed it is the emerging world's first
HMO for the urban working poor.
We are but two threads cut from the same cloth.
And if our fates are intertwined,
then we believe that it is good karma, it is good fortune.
And for many of us, our fortunes do indeed lie
at the bottom of the pyramid. Thank you.
(Applause)
That was fantastic.
I found that really moving.
You know, we fought hard to get at least
a small Pakistani contingent to come.
It felt like it was really important.
They went through a lot to get here.
Would the Pakistanis please just stand up please?
I just really wanted to acknowledge you.
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
The key question is, "When are we going to get fusion?"
It's really been a long time since we've known about fusion.
We've known about fusion since 1920,
when Sir Arthur Stanley Eddington
and the British Association for the Advancement of Science
conjectured that that's why the sun shines.
I don't know about you, but
when my mother gave me food,
I always sorted the ones I disliked
from the ones I liked.
And I ate the disliked ones first,
because the ones you like, you want to save.
And as a child you're always worried about resource.
And once it was sort of explained to me
how fast we were using up the world's resources,
I got very upset,
about as upset as I did when I realized
that the Earth will only last about five billion years
before it's swallowed by the sun.
Big events in my life,
a strange child.
(Laughter)
The countries that make a lot of money out of energy
have something underneath them.
Coal-powered industrial revolution in this country --
oil, gas, sorry.
(Laughter)
Gas, I'm probably the only person
who really enjoys it when Mister Putin
turns off the gas tap, because my budget goes up.
by those things that we're using up faster and faster and faster.
And as we try to lift billions of people out of poverty
in the Third World, in the developing world,
we're using energy faster and faster.
And those resources are going away.
And the way we'll make energy in the future
is not from resource,
it's really from knowledge.
If you look 50 years into the future,
the way we probably will be making energy
is probably one of these three,
with some wind, with some other things,
but these are going to be the base load energy drivers.
But we have a lot of knowledge to gain before we can make solar
the base load energy supply for the world.
Fission.
Our government is going to put in six new nuclear power stations.
They're going to put in six new nuclear power stations,
and probably more after that.
China is building nuclear power stations. Everybody is.
Because they know that that is one sure way
to do carbon-free energy.
the perfect energy source is one
that doesn't take up much space,
has a virtually inexhaustible supply,
is safe, doesn't put any carbon into the atmosphere,
doesn't leave any long-lived radioactive waste:
it's fusion.
But there is a catch. Of course there is always a catch in these cases.
Fusion is very hard to do.
We've been trying for 50 years.
And sorry about that, but this is what turns me on.
(Laughter)
I was a strange child.
Nuclear energy comes for a simple reason.
The most stable nucleus is iron, right in the middle of the periodic table.
It's a medium-sized nucleus.
And you want to go towards iron if you want to get energy.
So, uranium, which is very big, wants to split.
But small atoms want to join together,
small nuclei want to join together
to make bigger ones to go towards iron.
And indeed that's exactly what stars do.
In the middle of stars, you're joining hydrogen together to make helium
and then helium together to make carbon,
to make oxygen, all the things that you're made of
are made in the middle of stars.
But it's a hard process to do
because, as you know, the middle of a star is quite hot,
almost by definition.
And there is one reaction
that's probably the easiest fusion reaction to do.
It's between two isotopes of hydrogen, two kinds of hydrogen:
deuterium, which is heavy hydrogen,
which you can get from seawater,
and tritium which is super-heavy hydrogen.
And you push them together and they repel.
But when you get them close enough,
something called the strong force starts to act
and pulls them together.
So, most of the time they repel.
You get them closer and closer and closer and then at some point
the strong force grips them together.
For a moment they become helium 5,
because they've got five particles inside them.
makes helium 5.
Helium splits out, and a neutron comes out
and lots of energy comes out.
If you can get something to about 150 million degrees,
things will be rattling around so fast
that every time they collide in just the right configuration,
this will happen, and it will release energy.
And that energy is what powers fusion.
And it's this reaction that we want to do.
Well, there is a trickiness that you have to make it 150 million degrees,
but there is a trickiness about the reaction yet.
It's pretty hot.
The trickiness about the reaction is that
tritium doesn't exist in nature.
You have to make it from something else.
And you make if from lithium. That reaction at the bottom,
that's lithium 6, plus a neutron,
will give you more helium, plus tritium.
And that's the way you make your tritium.
But fortunately, if you can do this fusion reaction,
you've got a neutron, so you can make that happen.
This is basically why we would bother to do it.
If you just plot how much fuel
we've got left, in units of
present world consumption.
And as you go across there you see
a few tens of years of oil -- the blue line, by the way,
is the lowest estimate of existing resources.
And the yellow line is the most optimistic estimate.
that we've got a few tens of years, and perhaps 100 years
of fossil fuels left.
And god knows we don't really want to burn all of it,
because it will make an awful lot of carbon in the air.
And then we get to uranium.
And with current reactor technology
we really don't have very much uranium.
And we will have to extract uranium from sea water,
which is the yellow line,
to make conventional nuclear power stations
actually do very much for us.
This is a bit shocking, because in fact our government
is relying on that for us to meet Kyoto,
and do all those kind of things.
And breeder technology is fast breeders. And that's pretty dangerous.
The big thing, on the right,
is the lithium we have in the world.
And lithium is in sea water. That's the yellow line.
And we have 30 million years worth of fusion fuel in sea water.
Everybody can get it. That's why we want to do fusion.
Is it cost-competitive?
We make estimates of what we think it would cost
to actually make a fusion power plant.
And we get within about the same price
as current electricity.
We have to hold something at 150 million degrees.
And, in fact, we've done this.
We hold it with a magnetic field.
And inside it, right in the middle of this toroidal shape, doughnut shape,
right in the middle is 150 million degrees.
It boils away in the middle at 150 million degrees.
And in fact we can make fusion happen.
And just down the road, this is JET.
It's the only machine in the world that's actually done fusion.
I say, "Yeah, but we've actually done it." Right?
We can do fusion. In the center of this device
we made 16 megawatts of fusion power in 1997.
And in 2013 we're going to fire it up again
and break all those records.
But that's not really fusion power. That's just making some fusion happen.
We've got to take that, we've got to make that into a fusion reactor.
Because we want 30 million years worth of fusion power for the Earth.
This is the device we're building now.
It turns out you can't do fusion on a table top
despite all that cold fusion nonsense. Right?
You can't. You have to do it in a very big device.
More than half the world's population is involved in building this device
in southern France, which is a nice place to put an experiment.
Seven nations are involved in building this.
It's going to cost us 10 billion. And we'll produce half a gigawatt of fusion power.
But that's not electricity yet.
We have to get to this.
We have to get to a power plant.
We have to start putting electricity on the grid
in this very complex technology.
And I'd really like it to happen a lot faster than it is.
But at the moment, all we can imagine is sometime in the 2030s.
We're going to have a problem with power
in the next five years in this country.
So 2030 looks like an infinity away.
But we can't abandon it now; we have to push forward,
get fusion to happen.
I wish we had more money, I wish we had more resources.
But this is what we're aiming at,
sometime in the 2030s --
real electric power from fusion. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
My name is Ryan Lobo,
and I've been involved in the documentary
filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.
During the process of making these films
I found myself taking photographs,
often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.
And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that
I had photographs that told a better story
than a sometimes-sensational documentary.
I felt, when I had my photographs,
that I was holding on to something true,
regardless of agendas or politics.
In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.
And over there I experienced
other people's suffering, up close and personal,
immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,
and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.
and often to animated discussions at friend's homes,
where we would discuss various issues
while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,
where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid
their 14-year-old maid.
I would feel very isolated during these discussions.
But at the same time, I questioned myself
and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.
And I decided that I had compromised,
just like my friends in those discussions,
where we told stories
in contexts we made excuses for,
rather than taking responsibility for.
but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,
other substances and a woman.
(Laughter)
I basically decided that it was I,
not the camera or the network,
or anything that lay outside myself,
that was the only instrument in storytelling
truly worth tuning.
In my life, when I tried to achieve things
like success or recognition, they eluded me.
Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,
and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,
looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,
everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.
And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,
and gives voice to people and stories without.
I invite you into three recent stories of mine,
which are about this way of looking, if you will,
which I believe exemplify the tenets
of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.
where a group of my friends and I
did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,
on a very legendary and brutal war-lord
named General Butt Naked.
His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell
where he once used to torture and murder people,
including children.
Joshua claims to have personally killed
more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.
He got his name from fighting stark naked.
And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer
alive on Earth today.
Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,
and enforced his command with great brutality.
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,
and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.
How do you live with yourself
if you know you've committed horrific crimes?
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.
And he's on a mission.
visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.
He seeked forgiveness,
and he claims to endeavor to improve
the lives of his child-soldiers.
During this expedition I expected him
to be killed outright, and us as well.
But what I saw opened my eyes
to an idea of forgiveness
which I never thought possible.
In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,
people who had nothing absolved a man
who had taken everything from them.
He begs for forgiveness,
and receives it from the same woman
whose brother he murdered.
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,
was once a child soldier, under the General's command,
until he disobeyed orders,
and the General shot off both his legs.
He forgives the General in this image.
He risked his life as he walked up to people
whose families he'd murdered.
And Joshua remains silent
as they vented their rage against him.
This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,
with a man, surrounded by various influences,
desperate to hold on to something true within himself,
in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.
But the question is,
does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind
standing trial for his crimes,
and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,
to an audience that often includes his victims.
A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of
separation of church and state.
is about a group of very special fighting women
with rather unique peace-keeping skills.
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's
bloodiest civil wars,
which has left more than 200,000 people dead,
thousands of women scarred by rape and crime
on a spectacular scale.
Liberia is now home
to an all-woman United Nations contingent
of Indian peacekeepers.
help keep the peace, far away from home and family.
They use negotiation and tolerance
more often than an armed response.
The commander told me that a woman could gauge
a potentially violent situation
much better than men.
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.
This man was very drunk,
and he was very interested in my camera,
until he noticed the women, who handled him
with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.
(Laughter)
and it has not sustained any casualties,
even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.
And yes, all of those people killed were male.
Many of the women are married with children,
and they say the hardest part of their deployment
was being kept away from their children.
and watched as they walked past men,
many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,
she said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.
We know how to deal with these fellows,"
and ignored them.
Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women
to join the police force.
Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,
the most inspiring stories are the ones
that float just beneath the radar.
I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.
And one editor told me that she wasn't interested
in doing what she called "manual labor stories."
which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.
And all this against incredible logistical odds,
like heat and traffic jams.
Something amazing happened during this shoot.
Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,
a large slum, which had caught fire.
As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks
and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.
These men were terrified,
as the mob attacked our vehicle.
firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.
Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,
and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.
Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses
from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.
Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.
But the question that lingered in my mind was,
what causes people to destroy fire trucks
headed to their own homes?
Where does such rage come from?
And how are we responsible for this?
45 percent of the 14 million people
who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,
which are chronically overcrowded.
They lack even the most basic amenities.
And this is something that is common to all our big cities.
thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals
were blazing away and exploding all around us.
The heat was so intense, that hoses were used
to cool down firefighters
fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.
But over here, the heads of the DFS,
Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,
led the firefight with their men.
Something wonderful in a country where
manual labor is often looked down upon.
(Applause)
And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,
and my own faith in humanity.
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with
and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.
Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired
to do better because they were so pleased
to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.
at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,
read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.
Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,
regardless of the context,
can help magnify these intangibles three ways,
in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,
and also in the storyteller.
And that's the power of storytelling.
Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,
and it grows. Thank you.
(Applause)
Metaphor lives a secret life all around us.
We utter about six metaphors a minute.
Metaphorical thinking is essential
to how we understand ourselves and others,
how we communicate, learn, discover
and invent.
But metaphor is a way of thought before it is a way with words.
I've enlisted the help of one of our greatest philosophers,
the reigning king of the metaphorians,
a man whose contributions to the field
are so great that he himself
has become a metaphor.
I am, of course, referring to none other
than Elvis Presley.
(Laughter)
It's also a great example of how
whenever we deal with anything abstract --
ideas, emotions, feelings, concepts, thoughts --
we inevitably resort to metaphor.
In "All Shook Up," a touch is not a touch, but a chill.
Lips are not lips, but volcanoes.
She is not she, but a buttercup.
And love is not love, but being all shook up.
as the process of giving the thing
a name that belongs to something else.
This is the mathematics of metaphor.
And fortunately it's very simple.
X equals Y.
(Laughter)
This formula works wherever metaphor is present.
in this famous line from "Romeo and Juliet:"
Juliet is the sun.
Now, here, Shakespeare gives the thing, Juliet,
a name that belongs to something else, the sun.
But whenever we give a thing a name that belongs to something else,
we give it a whole network of analogies too.
We mix and match what we know about the metaphor's source,
in this case the sun,
with what we know about its target, Juliet.
And metaphor gives us a much more vivid understanding of Juliet
than if Shakespeare had literally described what she looks like.
This might look familiar.
The first step is pattern recognition.
Look at this image. What do you see?
Three wayward Pac-Men,
and three pointy brackets are actually present.
What we see, however,
are two overlapping triangles.
Metaphor is not just the detection of patterns;
it is the creation of patterns.
Second step, conceptual synesthesia.
in another sense organ as well,
such as colored hearing.
People with colored hearing
actually see colors when they hear the sounds
of words or letters.
We all have synesthetic abilities.
This is the Bouba/Kiki test.
What you have to do is identify which of these shapes
is called Bouba, and which is called Kiki.
(Laughter)
you will identify the round, amoeboid shape as Bouba,
and the sharp, spiky one as Kiki.
Can we do a quick show of hands?
Does that correspond?
Okay, I think 99.9 would about cover it.
Why do we do that?
Because we instinctively find, or create,
a pattern between the round shape
and the round sound of Bouba,
and the spiky shape and the spiky sound of Kiki.
Silence is sweet.
Neckties are loud.
Sexually attractive people are hot.
Sexually unattractive people leave us cold.
Metaphor creates a kind of conceptual synesthesia,
in which we understand one concept
in the context of another.
This is the Stroop test.
What you need to do here is identify
as quickly as possible
the color of the ink in which these words are printed.
You can take the test now.
If you're like most people, you will experience
a moment of cognitive dissonance
when the name of the color
is printed in a differently colored ink.
The test shows that we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words
even when the literal meaning gives the wrong answer.
The participants had to identify, as quickly as possible,
the literally false sentences.
They took longer to reject metaphors as false
than they did to reject literally false sentences.
Why? Because we cannot ignore
the metaphorical meaning of words either.
Now, unless you're a prison guard,
the sentence "Some jobs are jails" is literally false.
Sadly, it's metaphorically true.
And the metaphorical truth interferes with our ability
to identify it as literally false.
Metaphor matters because
it's around us every day, all the time.
Metaphor matters because it creates expectations.
Agent metaphors describe price movements
as the deliberate action of a living thing,
as in, "The NASDAQ climbed higher."
Object metaphors describe price movements
as non-living things,
as in, "The Dow fell like a brick."
to read a clutch of market commentaries,
and then predict the next day's price trend.
Those exposed to agent metaphors
had higher expectations that price trends would continue.
And they had those expectations because
agent metaphors imply the deliberate action
of a living thing pursuing a goal.
If, for example, house prices
are routinely described as climbing and climbing,
higher and higher, people might naturally assume
that that rise is unstoppable.
They may feel confident, say,
in taking out mortgages they really can't afford.
That's a hypothetical example of course.
But this is how metaphor misleads.
by activating analogies.
A group of students was told that a small democratic country
had been invaded and had asked the U.S. for help.
And they had to make a decision.
What should they do?
Intervene, appeal to the U.N., or do nothing?
They were each then given one of three
descriptions of this hypothetical crisis.
Each of which was designed to trigger
a different historical analogy:
World War II, Vietnam,
and the third was historically neutral.
made more interventionist recommendations
than the others.
Just as we cannot ignore the literal meaning of words,
we cannot ignore the analogies
that are triggered by metaphor.
Metaphor matters because it opens the door to discovery.
Whenever we solve a problem, or make a discovery,
we compare what we know with what we don't know.
And the only way to find out about the latter
is to investigate the ways it might be like the former.
He famously used thought experiments,
which are essentially elaborate analogies,
to come up with some of his greatest discoveries.
By bringing together what we know
and what we don't know through analogy,
metaphorical thinking strikes the spark
that ignites discovery.
But you just have to look at the words around you
and you'll find it.
Ralph Waldo Emerson described language
as "fossil poetry."
But before it was fossil poetry
language was fossil metaphor.
And these fossils still breathe.
"Cogito ergo sum."
That's routinely translated as, "I think, therefore I am."
But there is a better translation.
The Latin word "cogito"
is derived from the prefix "co," meaning "together,"
and the verb "agitare," meaning "to shake."
So, the original meaning of "cogito"
is to shake together.
And the proper translation of "cogito ergo sum"
is "I shake things up, therefore I am."
(Laughter)
giving us everything from Shakespeare to scientific discovery in the process.
The mind is a plastic snow dome,
the most beautiful, most interesting,
and most itself, when, as Elvis put it,
it's all shook up.
And metaphor keeps the mind shaking,
rattling and rolling, long after Elvis has left the building.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
but I've been living in Maldives for 26 years now.
So, that's home really.
The Maldives, as I'm sure you're aware, are a chain of islands
off the southwest coast of India here.
we're closer to Malé than we are to Delhi, for example.
But if you're a marine biologist, Maldives is not such a bad place to be.
investigating the marine life.
I study fish,
also the bigger things, whales and dolphins.
in the waters around here, off Maldives,
around the waters of India. You can see them off Kerala.
And, in fact, we're very lucky in this region.
One of the best places in the world to see blue whales
is here in this region.
during the northeast monsoon season,
you can see blue whales very, very easily.
It's probably the best place in the world to see them.
I'm sure many of you here know exactly what I mean,
but perhaps some of you are not quite so sure.
I need to explain a little bit about monsoons.
Now, monsoon, the root of the word "monsoon"
comes from the word "season."
And in the summer India heats up, gets very hot.
Hot air rises, and air is drawn in off the sea to replace it.
And the way it works is, it comes from the southwest.
It comes off the ocean here and is drawn up towards India.
So it comes from the southwest. It's a southwest monsoon.
Picks up moisture as it crosses the ocean.
That's what brings the monsoon rain.
And then in the winter things cool down.
High pressure builds over India.
And the whole system goes into reverse.
out of India, across the Indian Ocean,
this way towards Africa.
Keep that in mind.
Now, I'm a marine biologist, but I'm actually
a bit of an old fashioned naturalist, I suppose.
I'm interested in all sorts of things, almost everything that moves,
including dragonflies. And I'm actually
going to talk, this afternoon, about dragonflies.
This is a very beautiful species, it's called the Oriental Scarlet.
one important thing,
is that they lay their eggs in fresh water.
They need fresh water to breed.
They lay the eggs into fresh water.
Little larvae hatch out in fresh water.
They feed on other little things. They feed on mosquito larvae.
So, they're very important.
They control mosquito larvae, among other things.
And they grow and grow by stages. And they climb out
of the water, burst out, as the adult which we see.
And typically, there is a lot of variation,
but if you have a dragonfly with, say, a one year life cycle,
which is quite typical, the larva, living in the fresh water,
lives for 10 or 11 months.
And then the adult, which comes after, lives for one or two months.
So it's essentially a freshwater animal.
It really does need fresh water.
I want to talk about is this one,
because most dragonflies, like the one we've just seen,
when the adult is there for its brief one or two months of life,
it doesn't go very far. It can't travel very far.
A few kilometers, maybe, is quite typical.
They are very good fliers, but they don't go too far.
But this guy is an exception.
And this is called the Globe Skimmer,
or Wandering Glider.
And, as the name might suggest, it is found pretty much around the world.
It lives throughout the tropics, the Americas,
Africa, Asia, Australia, into the Pacific.
And it wanders far and wide. We know that much about it.
But it really hasn't been studied very much.
If you're going to study dragonflies, you want to study those really bright beautiful ones,
like that red one. Or the really rare ones, the endemic endangered ones.
This is, it seems a bit dull you know.
It's sort of dull-colored. And it's fairly common.
And it occurs everywhere -- you know, why bother?
But if you take that attitude, you're actually missing something rather special.
Because this dragonfly has a rather amazing story to tell.
And I feel very privileged to have stumbled across it
living in the Maldives.
dead keen on diving, spent as much of my time
as I could in and under the water.
Didn't notice any dragonflies; maybe they were there, maybe they weren't.
Didn't notice them.
But after some time, after some months, one day
as I was going out and about,
suddenly I noticed hundreds of dragonflies, hundreds of dragonflies.
Something like this, these are all this species Globe Skimmer.
I didn't know at the time, but I know now,
they're Globe Skimmers, hundreds of them.
And they were there for some time. And then they were gone.
the following year, when it happened again,
and then the year after that, and then the year after that.
And I was a bit slow, I didn't really take too much notice.
But I asked some Maldivian friends and colleagues, and yes they come every year.
And I asked people about them and yes,
they knew, but they didn't know anything,
where they came from, or anything.
And again I didn't think too much of it.
But slowly it began to dawn on me that something
rather special was happening.
And the Maldives, and I'm sure some of you have been there --
so here is home.
So, Maldives, beautiful place.
(Laughter)
It's built entirely of coral reefs.
And on top of the coral reefs are sand banks.
Average height, about that much above sea level.
So, global warming, sea level rise, it's a real serious issue.
But I'm not going to talk about that.
Another important point of these sand banks
is that when it rains,
the rainwater soaks down into the soil. So, it's gone.
So, it stays under the soil.
The trees can put their roots into it.
Humans can dig holes and make a well.
There is no surface fresh water.
There are no ponds, streams, rivers, lakes,
nothing like that.
So, why is it that every year
millions of dragonflies, millions,
millions of dragonflies turn up?
I got a little bit curious. In fact I'll stop here,
because I want to ask, and there is a lot of people who,
from India of course, people who grew up spending your childhood here.
Those of you who are Indian or spent your childhood here,
let me have a show of hands, who of you --
not yet, not yet!
You're too keen. You're too keen. No. Hang on. Hang on.
Wait for the go. I'll say go.
do you remember in your childhood, dragonflies,
swarms of dragonflies? Maybe at school,
maybe tying little bits of string onto them?
Maybe pulling bits off? I'm not asking about that.
You've only got to say, do you remember seeing lots of dragonflies.
Any hands? Any hands? Yes. Thank you. Thank you.
It's a widespread phenomenon
throughout South Asia, including the Maldives.
And I got a bit curious about it.
so, dragonflies, yeah, of course. Why not?
But in Maldives, no fresh water. So, what on Earth is going on?
And the first thing I did was started recording
when they turned up in the Maldives.
And there is the answer, 21st of October.
Not every year, that's the average date.
So, I've been writing it down for 15 years now.
You'd think they're coming from India. It's the closest place.
But in October, remember, we're still in southwest monsoon,
Maldives is still in the southwest monsoon.
But wind is, invariably, every time, is from the west.
It's going towards India, not from India.
So, are these things, how are these things getting here?
Are they coming from India against the wind?
Seemed a bit unlikely.
Maldives is a long archipelago.
It stretches about 500 miles, of course it's India here.
I got on the phone and emailed to friends and colleagues.
When do you see the dragonflies appear?
And pretty soon, a picture started emerging.
In Bangalore, a colleague there sent me
information for three years, average,
24th of September, so late September.
Down in Trivandrum, a bit later.
Far north of Maldives, a bit later.
Then Malé, then further south.
And then the southernmost Maldives.
It's pretty obvious, they're coming from India.
But they are coming 400 miles across the ocean, against the wind.
How on Earth are they doing that?
I didn't know.
I wanted to know about their seasonality,
what time of year, this is when they first arrive,
but how long are they around for? Does that give any clues?
So, I started a very rigorous scientific process.
I had a rigorous scientific transect.
I got on my bicycle,
and I cycled around the island of Malé.
It's about five kilometers around,
counting the dragonflies as I go,
trying not to bump into people as I'm looking in the trees.
October, November, December. That's it.
And then they tail off, there's a few, but that's it.
October, November, December. That is not the northeast monsoon season.
That's not the southwest season.
That's the inter-monsoon,
the time when the monsoon changes.
and then it changes and you get the northeast monsoon going the other way.
And that sort of gives the impression you've got one air mass
going up and down, up and down. It doesn't work like that.
What happens, actually, is there is two air masses.
And there is a front between them, and the front moves.
So, if you've got India here,
when the front is up above India you're into the southwest monsoon.
Then the front moves into the northeast monsoon.
And that front in the middle is not vertical,
it's at an angle.
I'm standing in Malé underneath the front.
I can be in the southwest monsoon.
But the wind above is from the northeast monsoon.
So, the dragonflies are actually coming from India on the northeast monsoon,
but at an altitude at 1,000 to 2,000 meters up in the air. Incredible.
These little insects, it's the same ones we see out here [in India],
two inches long, five centimeters long,
flying in their millions, 400 miles across the ocean,
at 2,000 meters up. Quite incredible.
I know how they come here. Then I scratched my head a bit,
and that's okay,
I know how they come here, but why do they come here?
What are millions of dragonflies doing, flying out over the ocean every year
to their apparent doom?
It doesn't make sense. There is nothing for them in Maldives.
What on Earth are they doing?
Well, to cut a long story short,
they're actually flying right across the ocean.
They're making it all the way across to East Africa.
who have sent to me reports from boats out in the ocean.
I know because we have reports from Seychelles,
which fit in as well, down here.
And I know because
when you look at the rainfall,
these particular insects, these Globe Skimmers
breed in temporary rain water pools.
Okay, they lay their eggs where the seasonal rains are,
the monsoon rains.
The larvae have to develop very quickly.
They only take six weeks. Instead of 11 months, they're six weeks.
They're up, and they're off.
the top is rainfall for India.
And we're starting in June. So this is the monsoon rain.
By September, October, it's drying out.
Nothing for these dragonflies. There is no more seasonal rain.
They've got to go hunting for seasonal rain.
And they fly south. As the monsoon withdraws to the south
they come down through Karnataka, into Kerala.
And then they run out of land.
But they are incredibly good fliers. This particular species,
it can fly for thousands of kilometers.
And it just keeps going. And the wind, the northeast wind
swooshes it around and carries it off across the ocean to Africa,
where it's raining.
And they are breeding in the rains of Africa.
Now, this is southeast Africa. It makes it look like there are sort of
two breeding periods here. It's slightly more complicated than that.
And the dragonflies you can see today
outside here, on the campus,
are the young of this generation.
They hatched out in India.
They're looking for somewhere to breed. If it rains here they'll breed.
But most of them are going to carry on. And next stop,
perhaps only four or five days away is going to be East Africa.
The wind will swoosh them out across here.
If they pass the Maldives they might go and have a look,
nothing there, they'll carry on.
they've actually just come out of a long drought.
Just last week the rains broke. The short rains broke
and it's raining there now.
And the dragonflies are there. I have reports from my various contacts.
The dragonflies are here now. They're breeding there.
When those guys, they'll lay their eggs now.
They'll hatch out in six weeks. By that time
the seasonal rains have moved on. It's not there, it's down here.
They'll fly down here. And the clever thing is
the wind is always converging to where the rain is.
The rain occurs, these are summer rains.
This is a summer monsoon.
The sun is overhead there. Summer rains in southern Africa.
The sun is overhead, maximum heating,
maximum evaporation, maximum clouds,
maximum rainfall,
maximum opportunities for reproduction.
you have this rising of the air
where it's hot, air is drawn in.
There's a convergence. So, wherever the rain is falling,
the air is drawn towards it to replace the air that's rising.
So, the little fellow that hatches out here,
he gets up into the air, he is automatically carried
to where the rain is falling.
Lay their eggs, next generation, they come up,
automatically carried to where the rain is falling.
It's now back there. They come out, it's time to come back.
So, in four generations, one, two, three,
four and then back.
This is a circuit of about 16,000 kilometers.
16,000 kilometers, four generations, mind you,
for a two inch long insect. It's quite incredible.
Those of you from North America
will be familiar with the Monarch butterfly.
It's only half the length of this one.
And this crossing here, of the ocean,
is the only truly regular transoceanic crossing
of any insect.
A quite incredible feat.
And I only stumbled on this because I was living in Malé,
in Maldives for long enough
for it to percolate into my brain
that something rather special was going on.
There is more to the story.
I'm also interested in birds. And I'm familiar
with this fellow. This is a rather special bird.
It's a falcon. It's called the eastern red-footed falcon, obviously.
But it's also called the Amur Falcon.
And it's called the Amur Falcon
because it breeds in Amurland.
Which is an area along the Amur River, which is up here.
It's the border, much of it is the border
between China and Russia, up here in the far east.
And that's where it breeds.
And if you're a falcon it's quite a nice place to be in the summer.
But it's a pretty miserable place to be in the winter.
It's, well, you can imagine.
So, as any sensible bird would do,
he moves south. They move south. The whole population moves south.
But then the being sensible stopped.
So, now they don't stop here, or even down here.
No, they turn across here.
They have a little refueling stop in northeastern India.
They come to the latitude of about Mumbai or Goa.
And then they strike out across the ocean, down to Kenya.
And down here, and they winter down here [in southern Africa].
Incredible. This is the most extraordinary migration
of any bird of prey. A quite incredible migration.
They have the most incredible journey, but several make the crossing from India
to Africa. Includes this one, the hobby.
This fellow is a very nice bird, this is the Pied cuckoo.
Those of you from northern India will be familiar with this.
It comes with the monsoons.
This time of year they cross back to Africa.
And this guy, the roller, a rather beautiful bird.
It's known as the Eurasian Roller. In India it occurs in the northwest,
so it's known as the Kashmir Roller.
And these birds, what I've done is I've complied all the records,
all the available records of these birds,
put them together, and found out they migrate at exactly the same time
as the dragonflies.
They make use of exactly the same winds.
They travel at exactly the same time with the same winds
to make the crossing. I know they travel at the same altitude.
one of these met an unfortunate end.
He was flying off the coast of Goa,
21 years ago, 1988. October, 1988.
An Indian Navy jet was flying off Goa,
bang! In the middle of the night. Fortunately, a two engine jet
got back to base, and they pulled the remains of one of these [Eurasian Rollers] out.
Flying at night over the Indian Ocean 2,424 meters.
Same height as the dragonflies go.
So, they are using the same winds.
And the other thing, the other important factor
for all these birds, all medium sized fellows,
Bee-eaters eat bees. This one has a nice blue cheek.
It's a Blue-cheeked Bee-eater.
And every one of these birds that makes the crossing
from India to East Africa
eats insects, large insects,
the size of dragonflies. Thank you very much.
In fact, they make their living on this stuff.
It's what you'd call a social news website;
In the last four years, we've seen all kinds of memes,
And then there was this: "Mister Splashy Pants."
In fact, someone on Reddit thought,
"What a great thing, we should all vote this up."
from the alien to Splashy, to help the cause.
to 70 percent at the end of voting.
because they wanted one of the more thoughtful names to win.
The idea was, "Vote your conscience, vote for Mister Splashy Pants."
What was cool were the repercussions.
Greenpeace created an entire marketing campaign around it --
Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins,
an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy.
were happy to participate, but they weren't whale lovers.
But no longer is the message coming from just the top down.
I'm going to show you how terrorism
actually interacts with our daily life.
15 years ago I received a phone call from a friend.
At the time he was looking after the rights of political prisoners
in Italian jails.
He asked me if I wanted to interview the Red Brigades.
Now, as many of you may remember,
the Red Brigades was a terrorist, Marxist organization
which was very active in Italy
from the 1960s until the mid-1980s.
As part of their strategy
the Red Brigades never spoke with anybody, not even with their lawyers.
They sat in silence through their trails,
waving occasionally at family and friends.
And they drew a list of people with whom they would talk,
and tell their story.
And I was one of those people.
When I asked my friend why the Red Brigades want to talk to me,
he said that the female members of the organization
had actually supported my name.
In particular, one person had put it forward.
She was my childhood friend.
She had joined the Red Brigades
and became a leader of the organization.
until the day she was arrested.
In fact, I read it in the newspaper.
At the time of the phone call
I just had a baby,
I successfully completed a management buyout
to the company I was working with,
and the last thing I wanted to do was to go back home
and touring the high-security prisons.
But this is exactly what I did
because I wanted to know
what had turned my best friend
into a terrorist,
and why she'd never tried to recruit me.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Now, I found the answer very quickly.
I actually had failed
the psychological profiling of a terrorist.
The center committee of the Red Brigades
had judged me too single-minded
and too opinionated to become a good terrorist.
My friend, on the other hand, she was a good terrorist
because she was very good at following orders.
She also embraced violence.
Because she believed that the only way
to unblock what, at the time,
was known as a blocked democracy,
Italy, a country run by the same party for 35 years
was the arms struggle.
I also discovered that their life was not ruled
by politics or ideology,
but actually was ruled by economics.
They were constantly short of cash.
They were constantly searching for cash.
Now, contrary to what many people believe,
terrorism is actually a very expensive business.
I'll give you an idea.
In the 1970s, the turnover of the Red Brigades
on a yearly basis
was seven million dollars.
This is roughly between 100
and 150 million, today.
it's really hard to produce this amount of money.
But this also explains why, when I was interviewing the Red Brigades,
and then, later on, other arms organizations,
including members of al-Zarqawi group in the Middle East,
everybody was extremely reluctant
to talk about ideology, or politics.
Because they had no idea.
The political vision of a terrorist organization
is decided by the leadership,
which, generally, is never more than five to seven people.
All the others do, day in and day out,
is search for money.
this part-timer from the Red Brigades.
It was a psychiatrist. He loved sailing.
He was a really keen sailor. And he had this beautiful boat.
And he told me that the best time of his life
was when he was a member of the Red Brigades
and he went sailing, every summer, back and forth
from Lebanon, where he would pick up
Soviet weapons from the PLO,
and then carry them all the way to Sardinia
where the other arms organization from Europe would go
and take their share of the arms.
For that service the Red Brigades were actually paid a fee,
which went to fund their organization.
and I think in economic terms,
all of the sudden I thought,
maybe there is something here.
Maybe there is a link, a commercial link,
between one organization and another one.
But it was only when I interviewed
Mario Moretti, the head of the Red Brigades,
the man who kidnapped and killed Aldo Moro,
Italian former prime minister,
that I finally realized
that terrorism is actually business.
I was having lunch with him
in a high-security prison in Italy.
And as we were eating,
I had the distinct feeling
that I was back in the city of London,
having lunch with a fellow banker or an economist.
This guy thought in the same way I did.
Naturally, nobody wanted to fund my research.
In fact, I think many people thought that I was a bit crazy.
You know, that woman that goes around to foundations
asking for money, thinking about the economics of terrorism.
So, in the end, I took a decision
that, in retrospect, did change my life.
I sold my company,
and funded the research myself.
is this parallel reality,
another international economic system,
which runs parallel to our own,
which has been created by arms organizations
since the end of World War II.
And what is even more shocking
is that this system
has followed, step by step, the evolution
of our own system,
of our Western capitalism.
And there are three main stages.
The first one is the state sponsor of terrorism.
And the third, of course, is the globalization of terrorism.
So, state sponsor of terrorism,
feature of the Cold War.
This is when the two superpowers were fighting
a war by proxy,
along the periphery of the sphere of influence,
fully funding arms organizations.
A mix of legal and illegal activities is used.
So, the link between crime and terror
is established very early on.
the Contras in Nicaragua, created by the CIA,
legally funded by the U.S. Congress,
illegally funded by the Reagan administration
via covert operation, for example, the Iran-Contra Affair.
Then comes the late 1970s, early '80s,
and some groups successfully carry out
the privatization of terrorism.
So, they gain independence from the sponsor,
and start funding themselves.
So, Arafat used to get a percentage
of the smuggling of hashish
from Bekáa Valley, which is the valley between Lebanon and Syria.
And the IRA, which control the private transportation system
in Northern Ireland, did exactly the same thing.
So, every single time
that somebody got into a taxi in Belfast
without knowing, actually,
was funding the IRA.
with globalization and deregulation.
This is when arms organization were able to link up,
also financially, with each other.
But above all, they started to do
serious business with the world of crime.
And together they money-laundered
their dirty business through the same channel.
This is when we see the birth of the transnational
arms organization Al Qaeda.
This is an organization that can raise money across border.
But also that is able to carry out attacks
in more than one country.
rogue economics.
So what is rogue economics?
Rogue economics is a force which is constantly
lurking in the background of history.
It comes back at times of great transformation,
globalization being one of those transformations.
It is at this times in which
politics actually loses control of the economy,
and the economy becomes a rogue force
working against us.
It has happened before in history.
It has happened with the fall of the Roman Empire.
It has happened with Industrial Revolution.
And it actually happened again, with the fall of the Berlin wall.
economic system composed by crime,
terror, and illegal economy,
before 9-11.
And it is a staggering 1.5 trillion dollars.
It is trillions, it's not billions.
This is about twice the GDP of the United Kingdom,
soon will be more,
considering where this country is going.
(Laughter)
the bulk of all this money
flew into the U.S. economy
because the bulk of the money was denominated in U.S. dollars
and the money laundering was taking place
inside the United States.
The entry point, of course, of most of this money
were the off-shore facilities.
So, this was a vital injection of cash
into the U.S. economy.
Now, when I went to look at the figures of the U.S. money supply,
the U.S. money supply is the amount
of dollars that the Federal Reserve
prints every year
in order to satisfy
the increase in the demand for dollars,
which, of course, reflects the growth
of the economy.
a growing number of these dollars
was actually leaving the United States,
never to come back.
These were money taken out
in suitcases or in containers, in cash of course.
These were money taken out by criminals and money launderers.
These were money taken out to fund
the growth of the terror,
illegal and criminal economy.
So, you see, what is the relationship?
that is the reserve currency of the world.
What does it mean? That means that
it has a privilege that other countries do not have.
It can borrow against the total amount of dollars
in circulation in the world.
This privilege is called seigniorage.
No other country can do that.
All the other countries, for example the United Kingdom,
can borrow only against the amount of money
in circulation inside its own borders.
between the worlds of crime, terror, and illegal economy, and our economy.
The U.S. in the 1990s
was borrowing against the growth
of the terror, illegal and criminal economy.
This is how close we are with this world.
Now, this situation changed, of course, after 9-11,
because George Bush launched the War on Terror.
Part of the War on Terror
was the introduction of the Patriot Act.
Now, many of you know that the Patriot Act
is a legislation that greatly reduces
the liberties of Americans in order to protect them
against terrorism.
which refers specifically to finance.
And it is, in fact, an anti-money-laundering legislation.
What the Patriot Act did was
to prohibit U.S. bank,
and U.S.-registered foreign banks
from doing any businesses with off-shore facilities.
It closed that door between the money laundering
in dollars, and the U.S. economy.
It also gave the U.S. monetary authorities
the right to monitor any dollar transaction
taking place anywhere in the world.
finance and banking.
All the bankers said to their clients,
"Get out of the dollars and go and invest somewhere else."
Now, the Euro was a newly born currency
of great opportunity for business, and, of course, for investment.
And this is what people did.
Nobody wants the U.S. monetary authority
to check their relationship,
to monitor their relationship with their clientele.
The same thing happened, of course,
in the world of crime and terror.
People simply moved their money-laundering activities
away from the United States
into Europe.
the Patriot Act was a unilateral legislation.
It was introduced only in the United States.
And it was introduced only for the U.S. dollars.
In Europe, a similar legislation
was not introduced.
So, within six months
Europe became the epicenter
of the money-laundering activities
of the world.
So, this is how incredible are the relationship
between the world of crime
and the world of terror,
and our own life.
I told you this story because you
must understand that there is a world
that goes well beyond the headlines of the newspapers,
including the personal relationship that you have
with friends and family.
You got to question everything that is told to you,
including what I just told you today.
(Laughter)
This is the only way for you
to step into the dark side, and have a look at it.
And believe me,
it's going to be scary.
It's going to be frightful, but it's going to enlighten you.
And, above all, it's not going to be boring.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
But we find 40 different names of clouds in this dialect used here.
But for the desert society
The desert is there, sand dunes, some small field.
And this is all big raised platform.
and there is a slope.
Below the surface there is hard saline water.
But now you can have this for year round.
It's two houses.
We often use a term called bylaws.
These raised up platforms just like this stage.
In fact they go 15 feet deep,
The age is 400 years.
So, since 400 years it has been giving you

Of course if you want to go inside, the two doors are locked.
But they can be opened for TED people.

And the water level -- these are not empty canisters --
water level is right up to this.
It can envy many municipalities,
the color, the taste, the purity of this water.

to bring water from the Himalayas.
So, water from 300, 400 kilometers away,
soon it become like this.
In many portions, water hyacinth
covered these big canals like anything.
you will notice in Bikaner things like this:
The bonus is that you can find wildlife around it.
these new cement tanks will supply you piped water.
It's a dream. And it became a dream also.
Because soon the water was not able to reach these areas.
Jaisalmer. This is heart of desert.
This town was established 800 years ago.
I'm not sure by that time
Bombay was there, or Delhi was there,
And this is the 16 centimeter area.
You won't find water in this slide.
But it is invisible.
Somewhere a stream or a rivulet
and deposit in the rooms.
And what we call private public partnership
you can add estate also.
So, estate, public and private entrepreneurs
it will submerge these beautiful statues
so water will be there for seven months or nine months,
or 12 months.
And then they will come and worship this pond,
pay respect, their gratitude.
The reputation in desert of this small water body is
that it never dries up.
In severe drought periods
nobody has seen this water body
getting dried up.
And perhaps they knew the future also.
It was designed some 150 years ago.
But perhaps they knew that on sixth, November, 2009,
there will be a TED green and blue session,
so they painted it like this.
This is called kund. We have, in English, surface water and ground water.
But this is not ground water.
You can draw ground water from any well.
But this is no ordinary well.

And where we have this gypsum strip
they can harvest this water.
they are all submerged.

please come to our area of six centimeters, we can give you water.

Three sides, such steps, on the fourth side
the best architects.
India could get the first engineering college
in 1847.
There were no English medium schools at that time,
even no Hindi schools, [unclear] schools.
but not to create the engineering colleges.
But because of them, first engineering college was created
in a small village, not in the town.
So, you can find through your Jeep,
a camel, and a cart.
This tire comes from the airplane.
So, look at the beauty from the desert society
who can harvest rainwater,
(Applause)
that the world can learn from this?
Or is this just right for this place?

(Applause)
I think first it's important for us to recognize what it is to be blind.
what use do we have for a blind woman?
I couldn't thread a needle or see the lice in my hair.
If an ant fell into my rice, I couldn't see that either.
So she is just one amongst the millions who are blind.
If we add to that the many of us here now
who are more productive because they have a pair of glasses,
then almost one in five Indians will require eye care,
a staggering 200 million people.
Today, we're reaching not even 10 percent of them.

And over time, we have grown into a network of five hospitals,
predominately in the state of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry,
and then we added several, what we call Vision Centers
as a hub-and-spoke model.
And then more recently we started managing hospitals
in other parts of the country
and also setting up hospitals in other parts of the world as well.
we have done about three-and-a-half million surgeries,
a vast majority of them for the poor people.
Now, each year we perform about 300,000 surgeries.
A typical day at Aravind, we would do about a thousand surgeries,
maybe see about 6,000 patients,
send out teams into the villages to examine, bring back patients,
lots of telemedicine consultations,
and, on top of that, do a lot of training,
both for doctors and technicians who will become the future staff of Aravind.
requires a lot of inspiration and a lot of hard work.
And I think this was possible thanks to the building blocks
put in place by Dr. V.,
a value system, an efficient delivery process,
and fostering the culture of innovation.
and suddenly you turn around and seem to be in contact with his inner being,
you seem to be one with him.
Here is a soul which has got all the simplicity of confidence.
Doctor, whatever you say, I accept it.
An implicit faith in you
and then you respond to it.
Here is an old lady who has got so much faith in me, I must do my best for her.
When we grow in spiritual consciousness,
we identify ourselves with all that is in the world,
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
and systems that support it.
But on a practical level, you also have to deliver services efficiently,
and, odd as it may seem, the inspiration came from McDonald's.
They feel they can train people all over the world,
irrespective of different religions, cultures, all those things,
to produce a product in the same way
and deliver it in the same manner
in hundreds of places.
and none of it made any sense to us.
He wanted to create a franchise,
a mechanism of delivery of eye care
with the efficiency of McDonald's.
techniques, methods, all in the same way,
and make it available in every corner of the world.
The problem of blindness is gone.
as American or African,
the problem is the same, the treatment is the same.
And yet, why should there be so much variation in quality and in service,
and that was the fundamental principle that we followed
when we designed the delivery systems.
And, of course, the challenge was that it's a huge problem,
we are talking of millions of people,
very little resource to deal with it,
and then lots of logistics and affordability issues.
And one of the early innovations, which still continues,
is to create ownership in the community to the problem,
and then engage with them as a partner,
and here is one such event.
Here a community camp just organized
by the community themselves,
where they find a place, organize volunteers,
and then we'll do our part. You know, check their vision,
and then you have doctors who you find out what the problem is
and then determine what further testing should be done,
and then those tests are done by technicians
who check for glasses,
or check for glaucoma.
and then prescribes a line of treatment,
and if they need a pair of glasses, they are available right there at the camp site,
usually under a tree.
But they get glasses in the frames of their choice,
and that's very important because I think glasses,
in addition to helping people see,
is also a fashion statement, and they're willing to pay for it.
So they get it in about 20 minutes
and those who require surgery, are counseled,
and then there are buses waiting,
which will transport them to the base hospital.
many people like this would probably never get services,
and certainly not when they most need it.
They receive surgery the following day,
and then they will stay for a day or two,
and then they are put back on the buses
to be taken back to where they came from,
and where their families will be waiting to take them back home.
It may sound impressive that we're seeing lots of patients,
very efficient process,
but we looked at, are we solving the problem?
We did a study, a scientifically designed process,
and then, to our dismay,
we found this was only reaching seven percent of those in need,
and we're not adequately addressing more, bigger problems.
so we set up what we call primary eye care centers, vision centers.
These are truly paperless offices
with completely electronic medical records and so on.
They receive comprehensive eye exams.
We kind of changed the simple digital camera into a retinal camera,
and then every patient gets their teleconsultation with a doctor.
we really had a 40 percent penetration in the market that it served,
which is over 50,000 people.
And the second year went up to 75 percent.
So I think we have a process by which
we can really penetrate into the market
and reach everyone who needs it,
and in this process of using technology, make sure
that most don't need to come to the base hospital.
We fixed the pricing, taking into account
what they would save in bus fare in coming to a city,
so they pay about 20 rupees, and that's good for three consultations.
or more advanced treatment and care?
We designed a van with a VSAT,
which sends out images of patients to the base hospital
where it is diagnosed,
and then as the patient is waiting, the report goes back to the patient,
it gets printed out, the patient gets it,
and then gets a consultation about what they should be doing --
I mean, go see a doctor or come back after six months,
and then this happens as a way of
bridging the technology competence.
because it focused on the non-customer,
and then by reaching the unreached,
we're able to significantly grow the market.
when you have very few ophthalmologists?
So what is in this video is a surgeon operating,
and then you see on the other side,
another patient is getting ready.
So, as they finish the surgery,
they just swing the microscope over,
the tables are placed so that their distance is just right,
and then we need to do this, because, by doing this kind of process,
we're able to more than quadruple the productivity of the surgeon.
we require a certain workforce.
And then we focused on village girls that we recruited,
and then they really are the backbone of the organization.
They do almost all of the skill-based routine tasks.
They do one thing at a time. They do it extremely well.
With the result we have very high productivity,
very high quality at very, very low cost.
So, putting all this together, what really happened was
the productivity of our staff was
significantly higher than anyone else.
but what this really is conveying is that,
when it comes to quality, we have put in
very good quality-assurance systems.
As a result, our complications are significantly lower
than what has been reported in the United Kingdom,
and you don't see those kind of numbers very often.
how do you make all this work financially,
especially when the people can't pay for it?
So what we did was, we gave away a lot of it for free,
and then those who pay, I mean, they paid local market rates,
nothing more, and often much less.
And we were helped by the market inefficiency.
I think that has been a big savior, even now.
And, of course, one needs the mindset to be wanting to give away
what you have as a surplus.
the expenditure has increased with volumes.
The revenues increase at a higher level,
giving us a healthy margin
while you're treating a large number of people for free.
I think in absolute terms,
last year we earned about 20-odd million dollars,
spent about 13 million, with over a 40 percent EBITA.
or what we have done,
if you really want to achieve solving this problem of blindness.
And what we did was a couple of very counter-intuitive things.
We created competition for ourselves,
and then we made eye care affordable
by making low-cost consumables.
We proactively and systematically
promoted these practices to many hospitals in India,
many in our own backyards and then in other parts of the world as well.
The impact of this has been that these hospitals,
in the second year after our consultation,
are double their output
and then achieve financial recovery as well.
this increase in cost of technology?
There was a time when we failed to negotiate
the [intra-ocular lens] prices to be at affordable levels,
so we set up a manufacturing unit.
And then, over time, we were able to bring down the cost significantly
to about two percent of what it used to be when we started out.
Today, we believe we have about seven percent of the global market,
and they're used in about 120-odd countries.
or is it just India or developing countries?
So to address this, we studied UK versus Aravind.
What it shows is that we do roughly about 60 percent
of the volume of what the UK does,
near a half-million surgeries as a whole country.
And we do about 300,000.
And then we train about 50 ophthalmologists
against the 70 trained by them,
comparable quality, both in training and in patient care.
So we're really comparing apples to apples.
We looked at cost.
(Laughter)
just because the U.K. isn't India the difference is happening.
I think there is more to it.
I mean, I think one has to look at other aspects as well.
Maybe there is --
the solution to the cost could be in productivity,
maybe in efficiency, in the clinical process,
or in how much they pay for the lenses or consumables,
or regulations, their defensive practice.
So, I think decoding this can probably bring
answers to most developed countries
including the U.S., and maybe
Obama's ratings can go up again.
in conditions where the problem is very large,
which cuts across all economic strata,
where we have a good solution,
I think the process I described,
you know, productivity, quality, patient-centered care,
can give an answer,
and there are many which fit this paradigm.
You take dentistry, hearing aid, maternity and so on.
There are many where this paradigm can now play,
but I think probably one of the most challenging things
is on the softer side.
Now, how do you make people own the problem,
want to do something about it?
There are a bit harder issues.
And I'm sure people in this crowd can probably find the solutions to these.
we identify with all that is in the world
so there is no exploitation.
It is ourselves we are helping.
It is ourselves we are healing.
The National Portrait Gallery is the place dedicated
to presenting great American lives,
amazing people.
And that's what it's about.
We use portraiture as a way to deliver those lives, but that's it.
And so I'm not going to talk about the painted portrait today.
I'm going to talk about a program I started there,
which, from my point of view, is the proudest thing I did.
that a lot of people don't get their portraits painted anymore,
and they're amazing people,
and we want to deliver them to future generations.
So, how do we do that?
And so I came up with the idea of the living self-portrait series.
And the living self-portrait series was the idea of basically
my being a brush in the hand
of amazing people who would come and I would interview.
the great hits of that program,
as to give you this whole notion
of how you encounter people in that kind of situation,
what you try to find out about them,
and when people deliver and when they don't and why.
One was that they be American.
That's just because, in the nature of the National Portrait Gallery,
it's created to look at American lives.
That was easy, but then I made the decision,
maybe arbitrary,
that they needed to be people of a certain age,
which at that point, when I created this program,
seemed really old.
Sixties, seventies, eighties and nineties.
For obvious reasons, it doesn't seem that old anymore to me.
Well, for one thing, we're a youth-obsessed culture.
And I thought really what we need is an elders program
to just sit at the feet of amazing people and hear them talk.
But the second part of it -- and the older I get,
the more convinced I am that that's true.
It's amazing what people will say when they know
how the story turned out.
That's the one advantage that older people have.
Well, they have other, little bit of advantage,
but they also have some disadvantages,
but the one thing they or we have is that
we've reached the point in life
where we know how the story turned out.
So, we can then go back in our lives,
if we've got an interviewer who gets that,
and begin to reflect on how we got there.
All of those accidents that wound up
creating the life narrative that we inherited.
what is it going to take to make this work?
There are many kinds of interviews. We know them.
There are the journalist interviews,
which are the interrogation that is expected.
This is somewhat against resistance
and caginess on the part of the interviewee.
Then there's the celebrity interview,
where it's more important who's asking the question than who answers.
That's Barbara Walters and others like that, and we like that.
That's Frost-Nixon, where Frost seems to be as important
as Nixon in that process.
Fair enough.
I wanted to be, as I later thought of it, empathic,
which is to say, to feel what they wanted to say
and to be an agent of their self-revelation.
By the way, this was always done in public.
This was not an oral history program.
This was all about 300 people sitting at the feet of this individual,
and having me be the brush in their self-portrait.
I didn't know it coming into it.
And the only reason I really know that
is because of one interview I did with Senator William Fulbright,
and that was six months after he'd had a stroke.
And he had never appeared in public since that point.
This was not a devastating stroke,
but it did affect his speaking and so forth.
And I thought it was worth a chance,
he thought it was worth a chance,
and so we got up on the stage,
and we had an hour conversation about his life,
and after that a woman rushed up to me,
essentially did,
and she said, "Where did you train as a doctor?"
When he started a sentence, particularly
in the early parts of the interview,
and paused, you gave him the word,
the bridge to get to the end of the sentence,
and by the end of it,
he was speaking complete sentences on his own."
I didn't know what was going on,
but I was so part of the process of getting that out.
or empathy, at any rate,
is what's critical to this kind of interview.
But then I began to think of other things.
Who makes a great interview in this context?
It had nothing to do with their intellect,
the quality of their intellect.
Some of them were very brilliant,
some of them were,
you know, ordinary people who would never claim to be intellectuals,
but it was never about that.
It was about their energy.
It's energy that creates extraordinary interviews
and extraordinary lives.
I'm convinced of it.
And it had nothing to do with the energy of being young.
These were people through their 90s.
was George Abbott, who was 97,
and Abbott was filled with the life force --
I guess that's the way I think about it -- filled with it.
And so he filled the room,
and we had an extraordinary conversation.
He was supposed to be the toughest interview that anybody would ever do
because he was famous for being silent,
for never ever saying anything
except maybe a word or two.
And, in fact, he did wind up opening up --
by the way, his energy is evidenced in other ways.
He subsequently got married again at 102,
so he, you know, he had a lot of the life force in him.
very gruff voice, from a woman.
I didn't know who she was,
and she said, "Did you get George Abbott to talk?"
and I could never do it."
And then she made me go up with the tape of it
and prove that George Abbott actually could talk.
you want the life force,
but you really want them also to think
that they have a story worth sharing.
The worst interviews that you can ever have
are with people who are modest.
Never ever get up on a stage with somebody who's modest,
because all of these people have been assembled
to listen to them, and they sit there and they say,
"Aw, shucks, it was an accident."
There's nothing that ever happens that justifies
people taking good hours of the day to be with them.
The journalist who did "The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich."
This guy had met Hitler and Gandhi within six months,
and every time I'd ask him about it, he'd say, "Oh, I just happened to be there.
Didn't matter." Whatever.
Awful.
I never would ever agree to interview a modest person.
They have to think that they did something
and that they want to share it with you.
to how do you get through all the barriers we have.
All of us are public and private beings,
and if all you're going to get from the interviewee is their public self,
there's no point in it.
It's pre-programmed. It's infomercial,
and we all have infomercials about our lives.
We know the great lines, we know the great moments,
we know what we're not going to share,
and the point of this was not to embarrass anybody.
This wasn't -- and some of you will remember
Mike Wallace's old interviews --
tough, aggressive and so forth. They have their place.
to break out of their own cocoon of the public self,
and the more public they had been,
the more entrenched that person, that outer person was.
And let me tell you at once the worse moment and the best moment
that happened in this interview series.
It all has to do with that shell that most of us have,
and particularly certain people.
It'll be your generational determinant
as to whether her name means much to you.
She did so much. She was a playwright.
She did an extraordinary play called "The Women."
She was a congresswoman
when there weren't very many congresswomen.
She was editor of Vanity Fair,
one of the great phenomenal women of her day.
And, incidentally, I call her
the Eleanor Roosevelt of the Right.
She was sort of adored on the Right
the way Eleanor Roosevelt was on the Left.
And, in fact, when we did the interview --
I did the living self-portrait with her --
there were three former directors of the CIA
basically sitting at her feet,
just enjoying her presence.
because I always have preliminary talks with these people
for just maybe 10 or 15 minutes.
We never talk before that because if you talk before,
you don't get it on the stage.
So she and I had a delightful conversation.
by the way, spectacular.
It was all part of Clare Boothe Luce's look.
She was in a great evening gown.
She was 80, almost that day of the interview,
and there she was and there I was,
and I just proceeded into the questions.
And she stonewalled me. It was unbelievable.
Anything that I would ask, she would turn around, dismiss,
and I was basically up there -- any of you
in the moderate-to-full entertainment world
know what it is to die onstage.
And I was dying. She was absolutely not giving me a thing.
and you think while you talk,
and basically, I thought, I got it.
When we were alone, I was her audience.
Now I'm her competitor for the audience.
That's the problem here, and she's fighting me for that,
and so then I asked her a question --
I didn't know how I was going to get out of it --
I asked her a question about her days as a playwright,
and again, characteristically,
instead of saying, "Oh yes, I was a playwright, and this is what blah blah blah,"
she said, "Oh, playwright. Everybody knows I was a playwright.
Most people think that I was an actress. I was never an actress."
But I hadn't asked that, and then she went off on a tear,
and she said, "Oh, well, there was that one time that I was an actress.
It was for a charity in Connecticut when I was a congresswoman,
and I got up there," and she went on and on, "And then I got on the stage."
"And you know what those young actors did?
They upstaged me." And she said, "Do you know what that is?"
Just withering in her contempt.
and then, after that, she delivered an extraordinary account
of what her life really was like.
Again, a remarkable person.
I'm not politically attracted to her, but through her life force,
I'm attracted to her.
And the way she died -- she had, toward the end, a brain tumor.
That's probably as terrible a way to die as you can imagine,
and very few of us were invited to a dinner party.
We all knew that.
She stayed in her room.
Everybody came. The butler passed around canapes.
The usual sort of thing.
Then at a certain moment, the door opened
and she walked out perfectly dressed, completely composed.
The public self, the beauty, the intellect,
and she walked around and talked to every person there
and then went back into the room and was never seen again.
She wanted the control of her final moment, and she did it amazingly.
and this is just a brief reference.
It wasn't this arm-wrestle,
but it was a little surprising for the person involved.
I interviewed Steve Martin. It wasn't all that long ago.
And we were sitting there,
and almost toward the beginning of the interview,
I turned to him and I said, "Steve," or "Mr. Martin,
it is said that all comedians have unhappy childhoods.
Was yours unhappy?"
"This is how you're going to start this thing, right off?"
And then he turned to me, not stupidly,
and he said, "What was your childhood like?"
and I said, "My father was loving and supportive,
which is why I'm not funny."
His father was an SOB,
and, in fact, he was another comedian with an unhappy childhood,
but then we were off and running.
So the question is:
What is the key that's going to allow this to proceed?
but I want to tell you about questions
that are more related to empathy
and that really, very often, are the questions
that people have been waiting their whole lives to be asked.
And I'll just give you two examples of this because of the time constraints.
Again, some of you will know him, most of you won't, Dumas Malone.
He did a five-volume biography of Thomas Jefferson,
spent virtually his whole life with Thomas Jefferson,
and by the way, at one point I asked him,
"Would you like to have met him?"
but actually, I know him better than anyone who ever met him,
because I got to read all of his letters."
So, he was very satisfied with the kind of relationship they had over 50 years.
I said, "Did Jefferson ever disappoint you?"
and connecting with him,
and he said, "Well ..." -- I'm going to do a bad southern accent.
Dumas Malone was from Mississippi originally.
But he said, "Well," he said, "I'm afraid so."
He said, "You know, I've read everything,
and sometimes Mr. Jefferson would smooth the truth a bit."
who lied more than he wished he had,
because he saw the letters.
He said, "But I understand that." He said, "I understand that."
He said, "We southerners do like a smooth surface,
so that there were times when he just didn't want the confrontation."
And he started to talk about that, and later on he invited me to his house,
and I met his wife who was from Massachusetts,
and he and she had exactly the relationship
of Thomas Jefferson and John Adams.
She was the New Englander and abrasive,
and he was this courtly fellow.
and most of the times when I talk about it,
people kind of suck in their breath at my audacity, or cruelty,
but I promise you it was the right question.
This was to Agnes de Mille.
Agnes de Mille is one of the great choreographers in our history.
She basically created the dances in "Oklahoma,"
transforming the American theater.
An amazing woman.
by the way, I would have proposed to her; she was extraordinary --
but proposed to her that she come on.
She said, "Come to my apartment."
She lived in New York.
"Come to my apartment and we'll talk for those 15 minutes,
and then we'll decide whether we proceed."
and she called out to me, and she was in bed.
I had known that she had had a stroke,
and that was some 10 years before.
And so she spent almost all of her life in bed,
but -- I speak of the life force --
her hair was askew.
She wasn't about to make up for this occasion.
and her most interesting possession she felt at that moment
was her will, which she had by her side.
She wasn't unhappy about this. She was resigned.
She said, "I keep this will by my bed, memento mori,
and I change it all the time
just because I want to."
And she was loving the prospect of death as much as she had loved life.
I thought, this is somebody I've got to get in this series.
She came on. Of course she was wheelchaired on.
Half of her body was stricken, the other half not.
She was, of course, done up for the occasion,
but this was a woman in great physical distress.
And we had a conversation,
and then I asked her this unthinkable question.
I said, "Was it a problem for you in your life that you were not beautiful?"
they're always on the side of the interviewee,
and they felt that this was a kind of assault,
but this was the question she had
wanted somebody to ask her whole life.
And she began to talk about her childhood, when she was beautiful,
and she literally turned -- here she was, in this broken body --
and she turned to the audience and
described herself as the fair demoiselle
with her red hair and her light steps and so forth,
and then she said, "And then puberty hit."
to her body and her face,
and how she could no longer count on her beauty,
and her family then treated her like the ugly sister of the beautiful one
for whom all the ballet lessons were given.
And she had to go along just to be with her sister for company,
and in that process, she made a number of decisions.
First of all, was that dance, even though
it hadn't been offered to her, was her life.
And secondly, she had better be,
although she did dance for a while, a choreographer
because then her looks didn't matter.
But she was thrilled to get that out as a real, real fact in her life.
There were other moments like that, very few moments of silence.
The key point was empathy
because everybody in their lives
is really waiting for people to ask them questions,
so that they can be truthful about who they are
and how they became what they are,
and I commend that to you, even if you're not doing interviews.
Just be that way with your friends
and particularly the older members of your family.
Chris has been so nice.
I don't know how you keep it up, Chris, I really don't.
So nice, all week. He's the kind of man you could say to,
"Chris, I'm really sorry, I've crashed your car.
And it gets worse, I crashed it into your house.
Your house has caught fire.
And what's more, your wife has just run off with your best friend."
(Laughter)
"Thank you for sharing, that's really interesting."
(Laughter)
One of the things about appearing later on in the TED week is that,
gradually, as the days go by,
all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say.
(Laughter)
Nuclear fusion, I had about 10 minutes on that.
Spectroscopy, that was another one.
Parallel universes.
And so this morning I thought, "Oh well, I'll just do a card trick."
(Laughter)
That one's gone as well.
And today is Emmanuel's day, I think we've agreed that, already, haven't we?
Emmanuel? Absolutely. (Applause)
I was planning on finishing on a dance ...
(Laughter)
So, that's going to look pretty shabby now.
is, what I can do is to launch today the first
TED Global auction.
If I could start, this is the Enigma decoding machine.
(Laughter)
Who will start me with $1,000? Anyone?
he said, "No, don't go through this. Don't, please don't.
Don't go through this. Don't do it."
(Laughter)
they said somewhere in the thing, they said, "15 minutes to change the world,
your moment onstage." 15 minutes to change the world.
I don't know about you, it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug.
(Laughter)
So, the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one.
Well, of course now we know we don't have to change a plug,
now we've seen that wonderful demonstration
of the wireless electric -- fantastic. You know, it inspires us.
300 years ago he'd have been burnt at the stake for that.
(Laughter)
And now it's an idea.
(Laughter)
It's great. It's fantastic.
But you do meet some fantastic people,
people who look at the world in a totally different way.
who covered most of what I was going to say.
(Laughter)
But when you think of the world in that way,
it does make going to Starbucks a whole new experience, don't you think?
I mean, he must walk in and they will say,
"Would you like a macchiato,
or a latte, or an Americano,
or a cappuccino?"
And he'll say,
"You're offering me things that are infinitely variable."
(Laughter)
"How can your coffee be true?"
(Laughter)
And they will say,
"Would you mind if I serve the next customer?"
(Laughter)
Fantastic. Really good.
Her talk about the aquatic ape, and the link, of course,
and the fact that we are all naked beneath this --
we're not hirsute and we can swim rather well.
And she said, you know, she's 90. She's running out of time, she said.
And she's desperate to find more evidence for the link.
And I think, "I'm sitting next to Lewis Pugh."
(Laughter)
This man has swum around the North Pole, what more evidence do you want?
(Laughter)
And there he is.
(Applause)
That's how TED brings these connections together.
job application -- um, sorry.
(Laughter)
I'm so sorry. (Applause)
I'm so sorry. No, no. (Applause)
No, no, ahh ... (Applause)
(As Brown): "Global problems require Scottish solutions."
The problem I have is because Gordon Brown, he comes onstage
and he looks for all the world like a man
who's just taken the head off a bear suit.
Uh, no." (Laughter)
"I'm sorry. I've only got 18 minutes, 18 minutes to talk about saving the world,
saving the planet, global institutions.
Our work on climate change,
I've only got 18 minutes, unfortunately I'm not able to tell you about
all the wonderful things we're doing to promote the climate change agenda
in Great Britain,
like the third runway we're planning at Heathrow Airport ..."
(Laughter)
"The large coal-fired power station we're building
at King's North,
and of course the exciting news that only today,
only this week, Britain's only manufacturer
of wind turbines has been forced to close.
No time, unfortunately,
to mention those."
(Applause)
"British jobs for Scottish people ...
No." (Laughter)
"Christian principles, Christian values.
Thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal,
thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife."
(Laughter)
"Although to be honest, when I was at Number 11 that was never going to be a problem."
(Laughter)
Alright Gordon, come on, eh.
I just, can I just say a few things about,
first about Cherie, because she's a wonderful lady,
my wife, with a wonderful smile.
That reminds me, I must post that letter."
(Laughter)
"I just think, you know, what people forget,
Gordon and I, we always got on perfectly well.
Alright, it was never exactly 'Brokeback Mountain.'"
(Laughter)
"You know, I wrote to him, just before I left office. I said,
'Can I rely on your support for the next month?'
And he wrote back. He said, 'No, you can't.'
Which kind of surprised me, because I'd never seen 'can't' spelled that way before."
(Laughter)
to the Mansion House in 2002 --
that was to the building; the people weren't listening.
But the people, when talking about the finance industry, he said,
"What you as the city of London have done for financial services,
we, as a government, hope to do for the economy as a whole."
(Laughter)
When you think what's happened to financial services,
and you see what's happened to the economy, you think,
"Well, there is a man who delivers on his promises."
(Laughter)
This is the first time that I can remember, where if you get a letter
from the bank manager about a loan, you don't know if you're borrowing
money from him, or if he's borrowing money from you.
Am I right?
Did anyone here have an Icelandic Internet account?
Why would you do that? Why would -- It's like one step up
from replying to one of those emails from Nigeria, isn't it?
(Laughter)
Asking for your bank details.
And, you know, Iceland, it was never going to cut it.
It didn't have that kind of collateral.
What does it have? It has fish, that's all.
That's why the Prime Minister went on television. He said,
"This has left us all
with a very big haddock."
(Laughter)
of things before I can make nonsense of them.
And making sense of the financial crisis is very, very difficult.
Luckily, somebody like George Bush was really helpful.
He summed it up, really, at a dinner.
He was speaking at a dinner, he said,
"Wall Street got drunk."
(Laughter)
"And now it's got a hangover."
And that's, you know, that's something --
(Applause)
And that's something we can relate to.
It's certainly something he can relate to.
(Laughter)
"There are the known knowns, the things we know we know.
And then you got the known unknowns,
the things we know we don't know.
And then you got the unknown unknowns, those are the things
we don't know we don't know."
And being English, when I first heard that I thought, "What a load of cock."
And then, you're now, well, actually, that's what this is about.
the chaotic unwinding of the world's financial system,
it's about -- they don't know, they didn't know what they were doing.
In 2006, the head of the American Mortgage Bankers Association said, quote,
"As we can clearly see,
no seismic occurrence
is about to overwhelm the U.S. economy."
Now, there is a man on top of his job.
(Laughter)
And when the crisis was happening, the head of quantitative equities
at Lehman Brothers said,
"Events which models predicted would happen
once every 10,000 years
happened every day for three days."
But we have a new hope. We have a new man.
America has now elected its first openly black President.
(Laughter)
Wonderful news.
Not only that, he's left-handed. Have you noticed this?
How many people here are left-handed?
You see, a lot of the people that I most admire,
they're great artists, great designers, great thinkers,
they're left-handed.
And somebody said to me last night, you know, being left-handed,
you have to learn to write without smudging the ink.
And somebody was talking about metaphors on Monday.
And I thought, what a wonderful metaphor, isn't it? An American President who
has to write without smudging the ink.
George Bush, well, what's the metaphor there?
I think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing, wouldn't it?
"Well, you know I'm sorry about that.
I'm right-handed but I seem to have smudged that ink as well."
(Laughter)
But, you know, he's gone. Now he's gone.
That's eight years of American History, eight minutes of my act,
just gone like that.
I happen to believe it was a great error.
I know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors
in the history of the United States.
But we proved them wrong in Iraq.
They said there was no link between Iraq and Al Qaeda.
There is now."
(Laughter)
"But I have a message for the suicide bombers,
for those people who've blown themselves up."
"We're going to find you."
(Laughter)
"We're going to make sure you don't do it again."
(Laughter)
arguably one of the worst speech makers
in American history,
now given way to one of the greatest, in Obama.
You were there, maybe, on the night of his victory.
And he spoke to the crowd in Chicago, he said,
"If there is anyone out there
who still doubts
that America is a place
where all things are possible ..."
I can't do the whole thing because it would take too long, it really would.
(Laughter)
But you get the picture. And then it goes to the inauguration.
And he and the Chief Justice, they trip over each other,
they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up.
And there is George Bush sitting there going, "Heh heh heh heh ..."
(Laughter)
"Not so easy is it? Heh heh heh."
(Laughter)
who said, people would listen to a speech, they said, "Great speech."
And then they'd listen to Demosthenes,
and they'd say, "Let's march."
And we all want to believe in President Obama.
It's rather like that line in the film "As Good As it Gets."
Do you remember that film with Helen Hunt and Jack Nicholson,
and Helen Hunt says to Jack Nicholson, "What do you see in me?"
And Jack Nicholson just says,
"You make me want to be a better man."
and makes you want to be a better citizen. Right?
But at the moment, it's a Cicero thing.
We like what Barack Obama says, but we don't do anything about it.
So he comes over to this country, and he says,
"We need
a big fiscal stimulus."
And everyone goes, "Great!" He leaves the country
and the French and the Germans go, "No, no, forget about that,
absolutely not." Nothing happens. He goes to Strasburg.
He says, "We need more boots on the ground in Afghanistan."
And everyone goes, "Great idea."
He leaves, people go, "No no no, we're not going to do that.
5,000 maximum, and no rockets. No, no, not going to do it."
He goes to Prague, he says, "We believe in a nuclear-free world."
let's just point that out first.
Do you remember that? George Bush, "A nu-ca-ler."
Sorry, what? "A nu-ca-ler."
(Laughter)
Could you say "avuncular"? "Avunclear."
(Laughter)
Thank you very much.
And that day, North Korea, that very day,
North Korea is just seeing if it can
just get one over Japan --
(Laughter) --
and land it before ...
"Travels the world." (Laughs)
"I believe, I believe it was President Dwight D. Eisenhower who said ..."
(Laughter)
"Tell a lie; it was Diana Ross ..."
(Laughter)
"... who said, reach out and touch ..."
(Laughter)
"... somebody's gla -- hand."
(Laughter)
"Make this world a better place, if you can.
I just think that's important. I really do.
And I was hoping Hillary would get to the White House,
because she'd have been out of our home for four years.
And I, you know." (Laughter)
"So, when that didn't work out I had to make a few arrangements, let me tell you."
(Laughter)
"And the environment is so important, all we can do.
My wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to
push emissions up her agenda."
(Laughter)
Mandela, the great man Mandela.
He's been honored with a statue now.
The previous highest honor he had in Britain
was a visit from the team from Ground Force, a gardening program.
"So, Nelson, how would you like a nice water feature?"
"Ahh, listen to me Mr. Titchmarsh."
(Laughter)
"I was held in prison
for nearly 30 years
on an island
in the middle of the ocean.
Why would I need a bloody water feature?"
(Laughter)
and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote
from the "Japanese Essays on Idleness"
which said it's nice to have something which is unfinished
because it implies there is still room for growth.
Thank you very much indeed.
(Applause)
I'm talking to you about
the worst form of human rights violation,
the third-largest organized crime,
a $10 billion industry.
I'm talking to you about modern-day slavery.
of these three children,
Pranitha, Shaheen and Anjali.
Pranitha's mother was a woman in prostitution,
a prostituted person.
She got infected with HIV,
and towards the end of her life,
when she was in the final stages of AIDS,
she could not prostitute,
so she sold four-year-old Pranitha to a broker.
By the time we got the information, we reached there,
Pranitha was already raped by three men.
We found her in a railway track,
raped by many, many men, I don't know many.
But the indications of that on her body was
that her intestine was outside her body.
And when we took her to the hospital
she needed 32 stitches to put back her intestine into her body.
We still don't know who her parents are, who she is.
All that we know that hundreds of men
had used her brutally.
sold his child for pornography.
You're seeing here images of
three years, four-year-olds, and five-year-old children
who have been trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation.
In this country, and across the globe,
hundreds and thousands of children,
as young as three, as young as four,
are sold into sexual slavery.
But that's not the only purpose that human beings are sold for.
They are sold in the name of adoption.
They are sold in the name of organ trade.
They are sold in the name of forced labor,
camel jockeying, anything, everything.
And I tell you stories from there.
My own journey to work with these children
started as a teenager.
I was 15 when I was gang-raped by eight men.
I don't remember the rape part of it so much
as much as the anger part of it.
Yes, there were eight men who defiled me, raped me,
but that didn't go into my consciousness.
I never felt like a victim, then or now.
But what lingered from then till now -- I am 40 today --
is this huge outrageous anger.
because I was a victim.
And that's what we do to all traffic survivors.
We, as a society, we have PhDs
in victimizing a victim.
Right from the age of 15,
when I started looking around me,
I started seeing hundreds and thousands of women and children
who are left in sexual slavery-like practices,
but have absolutely no respite,
because we don't allow them to come in.
Most of them come from very optionless families,
not just poor.
You have even the middle class sometimes getting trafficked.
I had this I.S. officer's daughter,
who is 14 years old, studying in ninth standard,
who was raped chatting with one individual,
and ran away from home because she wanted to become a heroine,
who was trafficked.
I have hundreds and thousands of stories of very very well-to-do families,
and children from well-to-do families,
who are getting trafficked.
99.9 percent of them
resist being inducted into prostitution.
Some pay the price for it.
They're killed; we don't even hear about them.
They are voiceless, [unclear],
nameless people.
But the rest, who succumb into it,
go through everyday torture.
Because the men who come to them are not men who want to make you your girlfriends,
or who want to have a family with you.
These are men who buy you for an hour, for a day,
and use you, throw you.
I have rescued more than 3,200 girls --
each of them tell me one story in common ...
(Applause)
one story about one man, at least,
putting chili powder in her vagina,
one man taking a cigarette and burning her,
one man whipping her.
We are living among those men: they're our brothers, fathers,
uncles, cousins, all around us.
And we are silent about them.
We think it is shortcut.
We think the person likes to do what she's doing.
But the extra bonuses that she gets
is various infections, sexually transmitted infections,
HIV, AIDS, syphilis, gonorrhea, you name it,
substance abuse, drugs, everything under the sun.
And one day she gives up on you and me,
because we have no options for her.
And therefore she starts normalizing this exploitation.
She believes, "Yes, this is it, this is what my destiny is about."
And this is normal, to get raped by 100 men a day.
And it's abnormal to live in a shelter.
It's abnormal to get rehabilitated.
It's in that context that I rescue children.
I've rescued children as young as three years,
and I've rescued women as old as 40 years.
When I rescued them, one of the biggest challenges I had
was where do I begin.
Because I had lots of them
who were already HIV infected.
One third of the people I rescue
are HIV positive.
And therefore my challenge was to
understand how can I get out
the power from this pain.
And for me, I was my greatest experience.
Understanding my own self,
understanding my own pain,
my own isolation,
was my greatest teacher.
Because what we did with these girls
is to understand their potential.
She works for a very big company,
a workshop in Hyderabad,
making furnitures.
She earns around 12,000 rupees.
She is an illiterate girl,
trained, skilled as a welder.
Why welding and why not computers?
We felt, one of the things that these girls had
is immense amount of courage.
They did not have any pardas inside their body,
hijabs inside themselves;
they've crossed the barrier of it.
And therefore they could fight in a male-dominated world,
very easily, and not feel very shy about it.
as masons,
as security guards, as cab drivers.
And each one of them are excelling
in their chosen field,
gaining confidence, restoring dignity,
and building hopes in their own lives.
These girls are also working in big construction companies
like Ram-ki construction, as masons, full-time masons.
My challenge has not been the traffickers who beat me up.
I've been beaten up more than 14 times in my life.
I can't hear from my right ear.
I've lost a staff of mine who was murdered
while on a rescue.
My biggest challenge
is society.
It's you and me.
My biggest challenge is your blocks to accept these victims
as our own.
a well-wisher of mine,
used to give me every month, 2,000 rupees for vegetables.
When her mother fell sick she said,
"Sunitha, you have so much of contacts.
Can you get somebody in my house to work,
so that she can look after my mother?"
And there is a long pause.
And then she says, "Not one of our girls."
in this fantastic A-C hall.
It's very nice for discussion, discourse,
making films and everything.
But it is not nice to bring them to our homes.
It's not nice to give them employment in our factories, our companies.
It's not nice for our children to study with their children.
There it ends.
That's my biggest challenge.
I'm here as a voice of the victims and survivors of human trafficking.
They need your compassion.
They need your empathy.
They need, much more than anything else,
your acceptance.
I keep telling them one thing:
don't tell me hundred ways
how you cannot respond to this problem.
Can you ply your mind for that one way
that you can respond to the problem?
And that's what I'm here for,
asking for your support,
demanding for your support,
requesting for your support.
Can you break your culture of silence?
Can you speak to at least two persons about this story?
Tell them this story. Convince them to tell the story to another two persons.
or Martin Luther Kings, or Medha Patkars,
or something like that.
I'm asking you, in your limited world,
can you open your minds? Can you open your hearts?
Can you just encompass these people too?
Because they are also a part of us.
They are also part of this world.
I'm asking you, for these children,
whose faces you see, they're no more.
They died of AIDS last year.
I'm asking you to help them,
accept as human beings --
not as philanthropy, not as charity,
but as human beings who deserve all our support.
I'm asking you this because no child, no human being,
deserves what these children have gone through.
Thank you.
(Applause)
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.
And I'm here today to give you
a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,
through what I'm doing now.
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.
I've been doing that for about 10 years.
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."
(Applause)
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.
sixth grade, my teacher said,
"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper
for the board."
I thought this was a great assignment.
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet
that's been folded just once.
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?
One hint: It's not "L."
(Laughter)
It could be an "L," of course.
So, what else could it be?
Yeah, a lot of you got it.
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.
I created something new, I was very excited
because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,
but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.
This was something really original. I got hooked.
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve
and has a right answer.
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,
which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.
You know, they might have a solution.
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.
Who designed this?
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story
so we have to hire writers to make movies.
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;
many puzzles have more than one.
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,
toys and games --
by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.
You can create one out of Legos.
You know, you can do anything you want.
Or competitive games like chess where,
well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,
but the goal really is to beat another player.
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.
It's a very small form, like a joke,
a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.
But at best they can reach for something more
and create a memorable impression.
The progression of my career that you'll see
is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.
is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.
This is called a figure-ground illusion.
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that
in some of his wonderful prints.
Here we have "Day and Night."
Here is what I did with figure and ground.
So, here we have "figure" in black.
Here we have "figure" in white.
And it's all part of the same design.
The background to one is the other.
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.
It's all "figure."
(Laughter)
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have
the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.
Each letter here is one of these digits.
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.
It's the same this way.
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab
who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.
(Laughter)
And recently in Magic magazine
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.
This appears in my puzzle calendar.
Okay, let's go back to the slides.
Thank you very much.
Now how would you do it interactively?
For a while I was an interface designer.
And so I think a lot about interaction.
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,
make the thing on the right.
Now, if you could pick up the black vase,
it would look like the figure on top.
If you could pick up the white area,
it would look like the figure on the bottom.
Well, you can't do that physically,
but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left
and make them so they look like the shape on the right.
And this follows the rules I just said:
any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.
But that is also true of any white area.
So, here we got the white area in the middle,
and you can pick it up.
I'll just go one step further.
So, here is --
here is a couple pieces. Move them together,
and now this is an active piece.
You can really get inside somebody's perception
and have them experience something.
It's like the old maxim of
"you can tell somebody something
and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."
There is a game called Rush Hour.
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design
besides Rubik's cube.
So, here we have a crowded parking lot
with cars all over the place.
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.
It's made by the company Think Fun.
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.
Okay, so how would you solve this one?
Well, move the blue one out of the way.
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.
You know? What do you do here?
The first move is going to be what?
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way
I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,
a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.
Now I'm making it available to schools.
And it includes exercises that show you
not just how to solve these puzzles,
but how to extract the principles that will let you solve
mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.
as well as just me creating them.
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.
I got interested in gene sequencing.
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence
of the base pairs in DNA?"
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,
and then you look for overlaps,
and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,
"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.
But it takes some persistence.
And when you're done, it makes this design,
which, if you squint, is the word "helix."
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,
rather than the other way around.
Which way will these fall?
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.
And depending on which one weighs which amount,
they'll fall different directions.
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,
the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,
and you get these peculiar pictures.
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?
Gets you thinking about color.
website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.
So, we're making smart games for social media.
I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.
First of all, you know, for a long time
computer games meant things like "Doom,"
where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,
aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open
what's called casual games.
And the main players are over 35, and are female.
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.
And it's a game you play with other people.
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.
Why? Well, we aging Boomers,
Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,
we're exercising. What about our minds?
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.
Everybody now considers themselves a creator,
and not just a viewer.
And what does this add up to?
Here is what we see coming.
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.
And we decided to combine our skills.
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.
And we have 24 seconds each.
Where is that?
I'll play as fast as I can.
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --
I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.
Okay, so that's the lens.
Anybody?
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?
That's the corner of the whole thing.
Yeah, I've played this image before,
but even when I make up my own puzzles --
and you can put your own images in here.
And we have people all over the world doing that now.
if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.
(Applause)
How do you observe something you can't see?
This is the basic question of somebody who's interested
in finding and studying black holes.
Because black holes are objects
whose pull of gravity is so intense
that nothing can escape it, not even light,
so you can't see it directly.
is about one particular black hole.
I'm interested in finding whether or not
there is a really massive, what we like to call
"supermassive" black hole at the center of our galaxy.
And the reason this is interesting is that
it gives us an opportunity to prove
whether or not these exotic objects really exist.
And second, it gives us the opportunity
to understand how these supermassive black holes
interact with their environment,
and to understand how they affect the formation and evolution
of the galaxies which they reside in.
we need to understand what a black hole is
so we can understand the proof of a black hole.
So, what is a black hole?
Well, in many ways a black hole is an incredibly simple object,
because there are only three characteristics that you can describe:
the mass,
the spin, and the charge.
And I'm going to only talk about the mass.
So, in that sense, it's a very simple object.
But in another sense, it's an incredibly complicated object
that we need relatively exotic physics to describe,
and in some sense represents the breakdown of our physical understanding
of the universe.
for the proof of a black hole,
is to think of it as an object
whose mass is confined to zero volume.
So, despite the fact that I'm going to talk to you about
an object that's supermassive,
and I'm going to get to what that really means in a moment,
it has no finite size.
So, this is a little tricky.
and that's known as the Schwarzschild radius.
And that's named after the guy who recognized
why it was such an important radius.
This is a virtual radius, not reality; the black hole has no size.
So why is it so important?
It's important because it tells us
that any object can become a black hole.
That means you, your neighbor, your cellphone,
the auditorium can become a black hole
if you can figure out how to compress it down
to the size of the Schwarzschild radius.
At that point gravity wins.
Gravity wins over all other known forces.
And the object is forced to continue to collapse
to an infinitely small object.
And then it's a black hole.
So, if I were to compress the Earth down to the size of a sugar cube,
it would become a black hole,
because the size of a sugar cube is its Schwarzschild radius.
And it turns out that it's actually pretty simple to figure out.
It depends only on the mass of the object.
Bigger objects have bigger Schwarzschild radii.
Smaller objects have smaller Schwarzschild radii.
So, if I were to take the sun
and compress it down to the scale of the University of Oxford,
it would become a black hole.
And it's actually quite a useful concept,
because it tells us not only
when a black hole will form,
but it also gives us the key elements for the proof of a black hole.
I only need two things.
I need to understand the mass of the object
I'm claiming is a black hole,
and what its Schwarzschild radius is.
And since the mass determines the Schwarzschild radius,
there is actually only one thing I really need to know.
that there is a black hole
is to show that there is some object
that's confined to within its Schwarzschild radius.
And your job today is to be skeptical.
Okay, so, I'm going to talk about no ordinary black hole;
I'm going to talk about supermassive black holes.
as if there could be such a thing as an ordinary black hole.
An ordinary black hole is thought to be the end state
of a really massive star's life.
So, if a star starts its life off
with much more mass than the mass of the Sun,
it's going to end its life by exploding
and leaving behind these beautiful supernova remnants that we see here.
And inside that supernova remnant
is going to be a little black hole
that has a mass roughly three times the mass of the Sun.
On an astronomical scale
that's a very small black hole.
And the supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the center of galaxies.
And this beautiful picture taken with the Hubble Space Telescope
shows you that galaxies come in all shapes and sizes.
There are big ones. There are little ones.
Almost every object in that picture there is a galaxy.
And there is a very nice spiral up in the upper left.
And there are a hundred billion stars in that galaxy,
just to give you a sense of scale.
And all the light that we see from a typical galaxy,
which is the kind of galaxies that we're seeing here,
comes from the light from the stars.
So, we see the galaxy because of the star light.
I like to call these the prima donna of the galaxy world,
because they are kind of show offs.
And we call them active galactic nuclei.
And we call them that because their nucleus,
or their center, are very active.
So, at the center there, that's actually where
most of the starlight comes out from.
And yet, what we actually see is light
that can't be explained by the starlight.
It's way more energetic.
In fact, in a few examples it's like the ones that we're seeing here.
There are also jets emanating out from the center.
Again, a source of energy that's very difficult to explain
if you just think that galaxies are composed of stars.
there are supermassive black holes
which matter is falling on to.
So, you can't see the black hole itself,
but you can convert the gravitational energy of the black hole
into the light we see.
So, there is the thought that maybe supermassive black holes
exist at the center of galaxies.
But it's a kind of indirect argument.
that maybe it's not just these prima donnas
that have these supermassive black holes,
but rather all galaxies might harbor these
supermassive black holes at their centers.
And if that's the case -- and this is an example of a normal galaxy;
what we see is the star light.
And if there is a supermassive black hole,
what we need to assume is that it's a black hole on a diet.
Because that is the way to suppress the energetic phenomena that we see
in active galactic nuclei.
at the center of galaxies,
the best place to look is in our own galaxy, our Milky Way.
And this is a wide field picture
taken of the center of the Milky Way.
And what we see is a line of stars.
And that is because we live in a galaxy which has
a flattened, disk-like structure.
And we live in the middle of it, so when we look towards the center,
we see this plane which defines the plane of the galaxy,
or line that defines the plane of the galaxy.
is it's simply the closest example of the center of a galaxy
that we're ever going to have, because the next closest galaxy
is 100 times further away.
So, we can see far more detail in our galaxy
than anyplace else.
And as you'll see in a moment, the ability to see detail
is key to this experiment.
inside a small volume?
Which is the job that I have to show you today.
And the tool that we use is to watch the way
stars orbit the black hole.
Stars will orbit the black hole
in the very same way that planets orbit the sun.
It's the gravitational pull
that makes these things orbit.
If there were no massive objects these things would go flying off,
or at least go at a much slower rate
because all that determines how they go around
is how much mass is inside its orbit.
there is a lot of mass inside a small volume.
So, if I know how fast it goes around, I know the mass.
And if I know the scale of the orbit I know the radius.
So, I want to see the stars
that are as close to the center of the galaxy as possible.
Because I want to show there is a mass inside as small a region as possible.
So, this means that I want to see a lot of detail.
And that's the reason that for this experiment we've used
the world's largest telescope.
with a mirror 10 meters, which is roughly
the diameter of a tennis court.
Now, this is wonderful,
because the campaign promise
of large telescopes is that is that the bigger the telescope,
the smaller the detail that we can see.
But it turns out these telescopes, or any telescope on the ground
has had a little bit of a challenge living up to this campaign promise.
And that is because of the atmosphere.
Atmosphere is great for us; it allows us
to survive here on Earth.
But it's relatively challenging for astronomers
who want to look through the atmosphere to astronomical sources.
it's actually like looking at a pebble
at the bottom of a stream.
Looking at the pebble on the bottom of the stream,
the stream is continuously moving and turbulent,
and that makes it very difficult to see the pebble on the bottom of the stream.
Very much in the same way, it's very difficult
to see astronomical sources, because of the
atmosphere that's continuously moving by.
to correct for the atmosphere, to give us a cleaner view.
And that buys us about a factor of 20.
And I think all of you can agree that if you can
figure out how to improve life by a factor of 20,
you've probably improved your lifestyle by a lot,
say your salary, you'd notice, or your kids, you'd notice.
the techniques that we use, called adaptive optics.
You're seeing an animation that goes between
an example of what you would see if you don't use this technique --
in other words, just a picture that shows the stars --
and the box is centered on the center of the galaxy,
where we think the black hole is.
So, without this technology you can't see the stars.
With this technology all of a sudden you can see it.
This technology works by introducing a mirror
into the telescope optics system
that's continuously changing to counteract what the atmosphere is doing to you.
So, it's kind of like very fancy eyeglasses for your telescope.
that little square there.
So, we're only going to look at the stars inside that small square,
although we've looked at all of them.
So, I want to see how these things have moved.
And over the course of this experiment, these stars
have moved a tremendous amount.
So, we've been doing this experiment for 15 years,
and we see the stars go all the way around.
and mine today is a star that's labeled up there, SO-2.
Absolutely my favorite star in the world.
And that's because it goes around in only 15 years.
And to give you a sense of how short that is,
the sun takes 200 million years to go around the center of the galaxy.
Stars that we knew about before, that were as close to the center of the galaxy
as possible, take 500 years.
And this one, this one goes around in a human lifetime.
That's kind of profound, in a way.
how much mass is inside a very small radius.
So, next we see a picture here that shows you
before this experiment the size to which we could
confine the mass of the center of the galaxy.
What we knew before is that there was four million
times the mass of the sun inside that circle.
And as you can see, there was a lot of other stuff inside that circle.
You can see a lot of stars.
So, there was actually lots of alternatives
to the idea that there was a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy,
because you could put a lot of stuff in there.
that same mass to a much smaller volume
that's 10,000 times smaller.
And because of that, we've been able to show
that there is a supermassive black hole there.
To give you a sense of how small that size is,
that's the size of our solar system.
So, we're cramming four million times the mass of the sun
into that small volume.
I have told you my job is to get it down to the Schwarzchild radius.
And the truth is, I'm not quite there.
But we actually have no alternative today
to explaining this concentration of mass.
And, in fact, it's the best evidence we have to date
for not only existence of a supermassive black hole
at the center of our own galaxy, but any in our universe.
So, what next? I actually think
this is about as good as we're going to do with today's technology,
so let's move on with the problem.
is a few examples
of the excitement of what we can do today
at the center of the galaxy, now that we know that there is,
or at least we believe,
that there is a supermassive black hole there.
And the fun phase of this experiment
is, while we've tested some of our ideas
about the consequences of a supermassive black hole
being at the center of our galaxy,
almost every single one
has been inconsistent with what we actually see.
And that's the fun.
You can ask, "What do you expect
for the old stars, stars that have been around the center of the galaxy
for a long time, they've had plenty of time to interact with the black hole."
What you expect there is that old stars
should be very clustered around the black hole.
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole.
they just should not be there.
A black hole does not make a kind neighbor to a stellar nursery.
To get a star to form, you need a big ball of gas and dust to collapse.
And it's a very fragile entity.
And what does the big black hole do?
It strips that gas cloud apart.
It pulls much stronger on one side than the other
and the cloud is stripped apart.
In fact, we anticipated that star formation shouldn't proceed in that environment.
So, what do we see?
Using observations that are not the ones I've shown you today,
we can actually figure out which ones are old and which ones are young.
The old ones are red.
The young ones are blue. And the yellow ones, we don't know yet.
So, you can already see the surprise.
There is a dearth of old stars.
There is an abundance of young stars, so it's the exact opposite of the prediction.
And in fact, today, this is what we're trying to figure out,
this mystery of how do you get --
how do you resolve this contradiction.
So, in fact, my graduate students
are, at this very moment, today, at the telescope,
in Hawaii, making observations to get us
hopefully to the next stage,
where we can address this question
of why are there so many young stars,
and so few old stars.
To make further progress we really need to look at the orbits
of stars that are much further away.
To do that we'll probably need much more
sophisticated technology than we have today.
for the Earth's atmosphere, we actually only
correct for half the errors that are introduced.
We do this by shooting a laser up into the atmosphere,
and what we think we can do is if we
shine a few more that we can correct the rest.
So this is what we hope to do in the next few years.
And on a much longer time scale,
what we hope to do is build even larger telescopes,
because, remember, bigger is better in astronomy.
And with this telescope we should be able to see
stars that are even closer to the center of the galaxy.
And we hope to be able to test some of
Einstein's theories of general relativity,
some ideas in cosmology about how galaxies form.
So, we think the future of this experiment
is quite exciting.
that basically shows you how these
orbits have been moving, in three dimensions.
And I hope, if nothing else,
I've convinced you that, one, we do in fact
have a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.
And this means that these things do exist in our universe,
and we have to contend with this, we have to explain
how you can get these objects in our physical world.
of how supermassive black holes interact,
and understand, maybe, the role in which they play
in shaping what galaxies are, and how they work.
none of this would have happened
without the advent of the tremendous progress
that's been made on the technology front.
And we think that this is a field that is moving incredibly fast,
and holds a lot in store for the future.
Thanks very much.
(Applause)
As an Indian, and now as a politician
and a government minister,
I've become rather concerned about
the hype we're hearing about our own country,
all this talk about India becoming a world leader,
even the next superpower.
In fact, the American publishers of my book,
"The Elephant, The Tiger and the Cell Phone,"
added a gratuitous subtitle saying,
"India: The next 21st-century power."
And I just don't think that's what India's all about,
or should be all about.
seems to me terribly archaic.
It's redolent of James Bond movies
and Kipling ballads.
After all, what constitutes a world leader?
If it's population, we're on course to top the charts.
We will overtake China by 2034.
Is it military strength? Well, we have the world's fourth largest army.
Is it nuclear capacity? We know we have that.
The Americans have even recognized it,
in an agreement.
Is it the economy? Well, we have now
the fifth-largest economy in the world
in purchasing power parity terms.
And we continue to grow. When the rest of the world took a beating last year,
we grew at 6.7 percent.
to what I think India really can aim to contribute in the world,
in this part of the 21st century.
And so I wondered, could
what the future beckons for India to be all about
be a combination of these things allied to something else,
the power of example,
the attraction of India's culture,
what, in other words, people like to call "soft power."
Joseph Nye, a friend of mine.
And, very simply, and I'm really cutting it short because of the time limits here,
it's essentially the ability of a country to attract others
because of its culture, its political values,
its foreign policies.
And, you know, lots of countries do this. He was writing initially about the States,
but we know the Alliance Francaise
is all about French soft power, the British Council.
The Beijing Olympics were an exercise in Chinese soft power.
Americans have the Voice of America and the Fulbright scholarships.
But, the fact is, in fact,
that probably Hollywood and MTV and McDonalds
have done more for American soft power
around the world than any specifically government activity.
partly because of governments,
but partly despite governments.
And in the information era we all live in today,
what we might call the TED age,
I'd say that countries are increasingly being judged
by a global public that's been fed
on an incessant diet of Internet news,
of televised images,
of cellphone videos, of email gossip.
In other words, all sorts of communication devices
are telling us the stories of countries,
whether or not the countries concerned want people to hear those stories.
to multiple channels of communication
and information have a particular advantage.
And of course they have more influence, sometimes, about how they're seen.
India has more all-news TV channels
than any country in the world,
in fact in most of the countries in this part of the world put together.
In order to have soft power, you have to be connected.
One might argue that India has become
an astonishingly connected country.
I think you've already heard the figures.
We've been selling 15 million cellphones a month.
Currently there are 509 million cellphones
in Indian hands, in India.
And that makes us larger than the U.S. as a telephone market.
In fact, those 15 million cellphones
are the most connections that any country,
including the U.S. and China,
has ever established in the history of telecommunications.
is how far we've come to get there.
You know, when I grew up in India,
telephones were a rarity.
In fact, they were so rare that elected members of Parliament
had the right to allocate 15 telephone lines
as a favor to those they deemed worthy.
If you were lucky enough to be a wealthy businessman
or an influential journalist, or a doctor or something, you might have a telephone.
But sometimes it just sat there.
And we would look at this instrument sitting in the front foyer.
But half the time we would pick it up
with an expectant look on our faces,
there would be no dial tone.
If there was a dial tone and you dialed a number,
the odds were two in three you wouldn't get the number you were intending to reach.
In fact the words "wrong number" were more popular than the word "Hello."
(Laughter)
If you then wanted to connect to another city,
let's say from Calcutta you wanted to call Delhi,
you'd have to book something called a trunk call,
and then sit by the phone all day, waiting for it to come through.
Or you could pay eight times the going rate
for something called a lightning call.
But, lightning struck rather slowly in our country in those days,
so, it was like about a half an hour for a lightning call to come through.
that a Member of Parliament stood up in 1984 and complained about this.
And the Then-Communications Minister replied in a lordly manner
that in a developing country
communications are a luxury, not a right,
that the government had no obligation to provide better service,
and if the honorable Member wasn't satisfied with his telephone,
could he please return it, since there was an eight-year-long waiting list
for telephones in India.
the 15 million cell phones a month.
But what is most striking is who is carrying those cell phones.
You know, if you visit friends in the suburbs of Delhi,
on the side streets you will find a fellow with a cart
that looks like it was designed in the 16th century,
wielding a coal-fired steam iron
that might have been invented in the 18th century.
He's called an isthri wala. But he's carrying a 21st-century instrument.
He's carrying a cell phone because most incoming calls are free,
and that's how he gets orders from the neighborhood,
to know where to collect clothes to get them ironed.
at the country farm of a friend,
about 20 kilometers away from any place you'd consider urban.
And it was a hot day and he said, "Hey, would you like some fresh coconut water?"
And it's the best thing and the most nutritious and refreshing thing you can drink
on a hot day in the tropics, so I said sure.
And he whipped out his cellphone, dialed the number,
and a voice said, "I'm up here."
And right on top of the nearest coconut tree,
with a hatchet in one hand and a cell phone in the other,
was a local toddy tapper,
who proceeded to bring down the coconuts for us to drink.
When they catch the fish they call all the market towns along the coast
to find out where they get the best possible prices.
Farmers now, who used to have to spend half a day of backbreaking labor
to find out if the market town was open,
if the market was on,
whether the product they'd harvested could be sold, what price they'd fetch.
They'd often send an eight year old boy all the way on this trudge
to the market town to get that information and come back,
then they'd load the cart.
Today they're saving half a day's labor with a two minute phone call.
is the real result of India being connected.
And that transformation is part of where India is heading today.
But, of course that's not the only thing about India that's spreading.
You've got Bollywood. My attitude to Bollywood is best summarized
in the tale of the two goats at a Bollywood garbage dump --
Mr. Shekhar Kapur, forgive me --
and they're chewing away on cans of celluloid discarded by a Bollywood studio.
And the first goat, chewing away, says, "You know, this film is not bad."
And the second goat says, "No, the book was better."
(Laughter)
but, having said that,
the fact is that Bollywood is now
taking a certain aspect of Indian-ness and Indian culture around the globe,
not just in the Indian diaspora in the U.S. and the U.K.,
but to the screens of Arabs and Africans, of Senegalese and Syrians.
I've met a young man in New York whose illiterate mother
in a village in Senegal
takes a bus once a month to the capital city of Dakar,
just to watch a Bollywood movie.
She can't understand the dialogue.
She's illiterate, so she can't read the French subtitles.
But these movies are made to be understood despite such handicaps,
and she has a great time in the song and the dance and the action.
She goes away with stars in her eyes about India, as a result.
Afghanistan, we know what a serious security problem
Afghanistan is for so many of us in the world.
India doesn't have a military mission there.
You know what was India's biggest asset in Afghanistan in the last seven years?
One simple fact:
you couldn't try to call an Afghan at 8:30 in the evening.
Why? Because that was the moment
when the Indian television soap opera,
"Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi," dubbed into Dari, was telecast on Tolo T.V.
And it was the most popular television show in Afghan history.
Every Afghan family wanted to watch it.
They had to suspend functions at 8:30.
Weddings were reported to be interrupted
so guests could cluster around the T.V. set,
and then turn their attention back to the bride and groom.
Crime went up at 8:30. I have read a Reuters dispatch --
so this is not Indian propaganda, a British news agency --
about how robbers in the town of Musarri Sharif*
stripped a vehicle of its windshield wipers,
its hubcaps, its sideview mirrors,
any moving part they could find, at 8:30,
because the watchmen were busy watching the T.V. rather than minding the store.
And they scrawled on the windshield in a reference to the show's heroine,
"Tulsi Zindabad": "Long live Tulsi."
(Laughter)
through the "E" part of TED:
its own entertainment industry.
The same is true, of course -- we don't have time for too many more examples --
but it's true of our music, of our dance,
of our art, yoga, ayurveda, even Indian cuisine.
I mean, the proliferation of Indian restaurants
since I first went abroad as a student, in the mid '70s,
and what I see today, you can't go to a mid-size town in Europe or North America
and not find an Indian restaurant. It may not be a very good one.
But, today in Britain, for example,
Indian restaurants in Britain
employ more people than the coal mining,
ship building and iron and steel industries combined.
So the empire can strike back.
(Applause)
with yoga and ayurveda, and so on,
with tales like Afghanistan,
comes something vital in the information era,
the sense that in today's world
it's not the side of the bigger army that wins,
it's the country that tells a better story that prevails.
And India is, and must remain, in my view, the land of the better story.
Stereotypes are changing. I mean, again, having gone to the U.S.
as a student in the mid '70s,
I knew what the image of India was then, if there was an image at all.
speak of the IITs, the Indian Institutes of Technology
with the same reverence they used to accord to MIT.
This can sometimes have unintended consequences. OK.
I had a friend, a history major like me,
who was accosted at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam,
by an anxiously perspiring European saying,
"You're Indian, you're Indian! Can you help me fix my laptop?"
(Laughter)
land of fakirs lying on beds of nails,
and snake charmers with the Indian rope trick,
to the image of India as a land of mathematical geniuses,
computer wizards, software gurus.
But that too is transforming the Indian story around the world.
But, there is something more substantive to that.
The story rests on a fundamental platform
of political pluralism.
It's a civilizational story to begin with.
Because India has been an open society for millennia.
India gave refuge to the Jews, fleeing the destruction of the first temple
by the Babylonians, and said thereafter by the Romans.
landed on the shores of Kerala, my home state,
somewhere around 52 A.D.,
he was welcomed on shore by a flute-playing Jewish girl.
And to this day remains the only Jewish diaspora
in the history of the Jewish people, which has never encountered
a single incident of anti-semitism.
(Applause)
That's the Indian story.
Islam came peacefully to the south,
slightly more differently complicated history in the north.
But all of these religions have found a place and a welcome home in India.
the biggest exercise in democratic franchise in human history.
And the next one will be even bigger, because our voting population
keeps growing by 20 million a year.
But, the fact is
that the last elections, five years ago,
gave the world extraordinary phenomenon
of an election being won by a woman political leader
of Italian origin and Roman Catholic faith, Sonia Gandhi,
who then made way for a Sikh, Mohan Singh,
to be sworn in as Prime Minister
by a Muslim, President Abdul Kalam,
in a country 81 percent Hindu.
(Applause)
because it was four years later that we all applauded
the U.S., the oldest democracy in the modern world,
more than 220 years of free and fair elections,
which took till last year to elect a president or a vice president
who wasn't white, male or Christian.
So, maybe -- oh sorry, he is Christian, I beg your pardon --
and he is male, but he isn't white.
All the others have been all those three.
(Laughter)
All his predecessors have been all those three,
and that's the point I was trying to make.
(Laughter)
that when I talked about that example,
it's not just about talking about India, it's not propaganda.
Because ultimately, that electoral outcome
had nothing to do with the rest of the world.
It was essentially India being itself.
And ultimately, it seems to me,
that always works better than propaganda.
Governments aren't very good at telling stories.
But people see a society for what it is,
and that, it seems to me, is what ultimately
will make a difference in today's information era,
in today's TED age.
the nationalism of ethnicity or language or religion,
because we have every ethnicity known to mankind, practically,
we've every religion know to mankind,
with the possible exception of Shintoism,
though that has some Hindu elements somewhere.
We have 23 official languages that are recognized in our Constitution.
And those of you who cashed your money here
might be surprised to see how many scripts there are
on the rupee note, spelling out the denominations.
We've got all of that.
We don't even have geography uniting us,
because the natural geography of the subcontinent
framed by the mountains and the sea was hacked
by the partition with Pakistan in 1947.
In fact, you can't even take the name of the country for granted,
because the name "India" comes from the river Indus,
which flows in Pakistan.
is the nationalism of an idea.
It's the idea of an ever-ever-land,
emerging from an ancient civilization,
united by a shared history,
but sustained, above all, by pluralist democracy.
That is a 21st-century story as well as an ancient one.
And it's the nationalism of an idea that
essentially says you can endure differences of caste, creed,
color, culture, cuisine, custom and costume, consonant, for that matter,
and still rally around a consensus.
And the consensus is of a very simple principle,
that in a diverse plural democracy like India
you don't really have to agree on everything all the time,
so long as you agree on the ground rules
of how you will disagree.
The great success story of India,
a country that so many learned scholars and journalists
assumed would disintegrate, in the '50s and '60s,
is that it managed to maintain consensus on how to survive without consensus.
And I do want to make the point
that if there is anything worth celebrating about India,
it isn't military muscle, economic power.
All of that is necessary,
but we still have huge amounts of problems to overcome.
Somebody said we are super poor, and we are also super power.
We can't really be both of those.
We have to overcome our poverty. We have to deal with the
hardware of development,
the ports, the roads, the airports,
all the infrastructural things we need to do,
and the software of development,
the human capital, the need for the ordinary person in India
to be able to have a couple of square meals a day,
to be able to send his or her children
to a decent school,
and to aspire to work a job
that will give them opportunities in their lives
that can transform themselves.
those real challenges which none of us can pretend don't exist.
But, it's all taking place in an open society,
in a rich and diverse and plural civilization,
in one that is determined to liberate and fulfill
the creative energies of its people.
That's why India belongs at TED,
and that's why TED belongs in India.
Thank you very much.

One day a one-eyed monkey came into the forest.
Under a tree she saw a woman
meditating furiously.
The one-eyed monkey recognized the woman, a Sekhri.
She was the wife of an even more famous Brahmin.
To watch her better, the one-eyed monkey climbed onto the tree.
Just then, with a loud bang,
the heavens opened. (Claps)
And the god Indra jumped into the clearing.
Indra saw the woman, a Sekhri.
Ah-hah.
The woman paid him no heed.
So, Indra, attracted, threw her onto the floor,
and proceeded to rape her.
Then Indra disappeared. (Clap! Clap!)
And the woman's husband, the Brahmin, appeared.
He realized at once what had happened.
So, he petitioned the higher gods
so that he may have justice.
So, the god Vishnu arrived.
really wanted for the woman, a Sekhri, to get justice,
so she retold events exactly as they had happened.
Vishnu gave his judgment.
in that he has sinned against ... a Brahmin.
May he be called to wash away his sins."
and performed the sacrifice of the horse.
And so it transpired
that a horse was killed,
a god was made sin-free,
a Brahmin's ego was appeased,
a woman ... was ruined,
and a one-eyed monkey was left ...
very confused at what we humans call justice.
In India, only 25 percent of rapes
come to a police station,
and of these 25 percent that come to a police station,
convictions are only in four percent of the cases.
That's a lot of women who don't get justice.
Look around you, look at your own countries.
There is a certain pattern in who gets charged with crimes.
If you're in Australia, it's mostly aboriginals who are in jail.
If you're in India, it's either Muslims or Adivasis,
our tribals, the Naxalites.
If you're in the U.S., it's mostly the blacks.
There is a trend here.
And the Brahmins and the gods, like in my story,
always get to tell their truth as The Truth.
So, have we all become
one-eyed -- two-eyed instead of one-eyed -- monkeys?
Have we stopped seeing injustice?
(Applause)
You know, I have told this story
close to 550 times,
in audiences in 40 countries,
to school students, to black-tie dinners at the Smithsonian, and so on and so forth,
and every time it hits something.
Now, if I were to go into the same crowd
and say, "I want to lecture you about justice and injustice,"
they would say, "Thank you very much, we have other things to do."
And that is the astonishing power of art.
You can't have barriers, because it breaks through your prejudices,
breaks through everything that you have as your mask,
that says, "I am this, I am that, I am that."
No. It breaks through those.
And it reaches somewhere where other things don't.
And in a world where attitudes are so difficult to change,
we need a language that reaches through.
to make all the Nazis feel wonderful and Aryan.
And Mr. Berlusconi knows it, as he sits atop
this huge empire of media and television and so on and so forth.
And all of the wonderful creative minds who are in all the advertising agencies,
and who help corporate sell us things we absolutely don't require,
they also know the power of the arts.
When I was a young child, my mother, who was a choreographer,
came upon a phenomenon that worried her.
It was a phenomenon where young brides
were committing suicide in rural Gujarat,
because they were being forced to bring more and more money for their in-laws' families.
And she created a dance piece which then Prime Minister Nehru saw.
He came to talk to her and said, "What is this about?"
She told him and he set out the first inquiry
into what today we call Dowry Dance.
Imagine a dance piece
for the first inquiry into something
that even today kills thousands of women.
in "The Mahabharata" playing this feisty feminine feminist
called Draupadi, I had similar experiences.
Big fat black mamas in the Bronx
used to come and say, "Hey girl, that's it!"
And then these trendy young things in the Sorbonne would say,
"Madame Draupadi, on n'est pas feministe, mais ça? Ça!"
And then aboriginal women in Africa
would come and say, "This is it!"
And I thought, "This is what we need,
as a language."
Well, millions of people around the world die
of waterborne disease every year.
And that's because there is no clean water to drink,
or in countries like India,
people don't know that they need to soap their hands before defecation.
So, what do they do?
They drink the water they know is dirty,
they get cholera, they get diarrhea, they get jaundice
and they die.
And governments have not been able to provide clean water.
They try and build it. They try and build pipelines; it doesn't happen.
And the MNCs give them machines that they cannot afford.
So what do you do? Do you let them die?
And it was a simple idea. It was an idea that could not profit anybody
but would help health in every field.
Most houses in Asia and India
have a cotton garment.
And it was discovered, and WHO endorses this,
that a clean cotton garment folded eight times over,
can reduce bacteria up to 80 percent from water sieved through.
So, why aren't governments blaring this on television?
Why isn't it on every poster across the third world?
Because there is no profit in it.
Because nobody can get a kickback.
But it still needs to get to people.
And here is one of the ways we get it to people.
I have a solution that requires neither machine,
nor wood, nor cooking gas.
All the germs from the water we take.
All the germs from the water we take.
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
Five, six, seven, eight folds we make.
Our drinking water safe we make.
And through this we will have clean water.
are deeply concerned about the escalating violence in our daily lives.
While universities are trying to devise courses in conflict resolution,
and governments are trying to stop skirmishes at borders,
we are surrounded by violence, whether it's road rage,
or whether it's domestic violence,
whether it's a teacher beating up a student and killing her
because she hasn't done her homework, it's everywhere.
So, why are we not doing something
to actually attend that problem on a day to day basis?
and young people realize
that violence is something that we indulge in,
that we can stop,
and that there are other ways of actually
taking violence, taking anger, taking frustrations
into different things that do not harm other people.
Well, here is one such way.
Your parents were peaceful people.
Your grandparents were peaceful people.
So much peace in one place?
How could it be otherwise?
Yes. What if ...
One little gene in you
has been trying to get through?
From your beginnings in Africa,
through each generation, may be passed on to you,
in your creation. It's a secret urge, hiding deep in you.
And if it's in you, then it's in me too. Oh, dear.
stamp on a cockroach, scratch your mother.
It's the feeling that wells up from deep inside,
when your husband comes home drunk and you wanna tan his hide.
Want to kill that cyclist on the way to work,
and string up your cousin 'cause she's such a jerk. Oh, dear.
And as for outsiders, white, black or brown,
tar and feather them, and whip them out of town.
Too small for detection, it's your built-in protection.
Adrenaline, kill. It'll give you the will.
Yes, you'd better face it 'cause you can't displace it.
You're V-I-O-L-E-N-T.
Cause you're either a victim, or on top, like me.
Goodbye, Mahatma Gandhi.
Goodbye, Martin Luther King.
Hello, gangs from this neighborhood
killing gangs from that neighborhood.
Hello governments of rich countries
selling arms to governments of poor countries
who can't even afford to give them food.
Hello civilization. Hello, 21st century.
Look what we've ...
look what they've done.
(Applause)
has been used across the world to talk about social issues.
A few years ago we had a film called Rang De Basanti,
which suddenly spawned thousands of young people
wanting to volunteer for social change.
In Venezuela, one of the most popular
soap operas has a heroine called Crystal.
And when, onscreen, Crystal got breast cancer,
75,000 more young women went to have mammographies done.
And of course, "The Vagina Monologues" we know about.
And there are stand-up comics
who are talking about racial issues, about ethnic issues.
that if we think that we all agree
that we need a better world,
we need a more just world,
why is it that we are not using the one language
that has consistently showed us
that we can break down barriers, that we can reach people?
What I need to say to the planners of the world,
the governments, the strategists
is, "You have treated the arts as the cherry on the cake.
It needs to be the yeast."
Because, any future planning,
if 2048 is when we want to get there,
unless the arts are put with the scientists,
with the economists,
with all those who prepare for the future, badly,
we're not going to get there.
And unless this is actually internalized, it won't happen.
We need to break down our vision
of what planners are,
of what the correct way of a path is.
And to say all these years of trying
to make a better world, and we have failed.
There are more people being raped. There are more wars.
There are more people dying of simple things.
So, something has got to give. And that is what I want.
Can I have my last audio track please?
(Whistling)
Her father the king said, "Don't whistle."
Her mother the queen said, "Hai, don't whistle."
But the princess continued whistling.
(Whistling)
into a beautiful young woman,
who whistled even more beautifully.
(Whistling)
Her father the king said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
Her mother the queen said, "Who will marry a whistling princess?"
He announced a Swayamvara.
He invited all the princes to come and defeat his daughter at whistling.
"Whoever defeats my daughter shall have half my kingdom
and her hand in marriage!"
Soon the palace filled with princes whistling.
(Whistling)
Some whistled badly.
Some whistled well.
But nobody could defeat the princess.
"Now what shall we do?" said the queen.
But the princess said, "Father, Mother, don't worry.
I have an idea. I am going to go to each of these young men
and I am going to ask them
if they defeated correctly.
And if somebody answers, that shall be my wish."
And they said, "Me? Defeated by a woman?
No way, that's impossible! No no no no no! That's not possible."
Till finally one prince said,
"Princess, I accept, you have defeated me."
"Uh-huh ..." she said.
"Father, mother, this man shall be my wife."
(Whistling)
(Applause)
It's a bit funny to be
at a conference dedicated to things not seen,
and present my proposal to build
a 6,000-kilometer-long wall
across the entire African continent.
About the size of the Great Wall of China,
this would hardly be an invisible structure.
And yet it's made from parts that are invisible, or near-invisible, to the naked eye:
bacteria and grains of sand.
But I don't really believe in architectural problems;
I only believe in opportunities.
Which is why I'll show you a threat,
and an architectural response.
The threat is desertification.
My response is a sandstone wall
made from bacteria and solidified sand,
stretching across the desert.
of beautiful contradictions.
It is simple and complex.
It is peaceful and violent.
It is always the same, never the same,
endlessly fascinating.
One billion grains of sand
come into existence in the world each second.
That's a cyclical process.
As rocks and mountains die,
grains of sand are born.
Some of those grains may then cement naturally into sandstone.
And as the sandstone weathers, new grains break free.
Some of those grains may then accumulate
on a massive scale,
into a sand dune.
becomes a moving mountain of sand.
But, moving mountains can be dangerous. Let me try and explain why.
Dry areas cover more than one third of the Earth's land surfaces.
Some are already deserts;
others are being seriously degraded by the sand.
Just south of the Sahara we find the Sahel.
The name means "edge of the desert."
And this is the region most closely associated with desertification.
It was here in the late '60s and early '70s
that major droughts brought three million people
to become dependent upon emergency food aid,
with about up to 250,000 dying.
And it's one that gets very little attention.
In our accelerated media culture,
desertification is simply too slow
to reach the headlines.
It's nothing like a tsunami or a Katrina:
too few crying children and smashed up houses.
And yet desertification
is a major threat on all continents,
affecting some 110 countries
and about 70 percent of the world's agricultural drylands.
of millions of people,
and especially in Africa and China.
And it is largely an issue that we've created for ourselves
through unsustainable use of scarce resources.
So, we get climate change.
We get droughts,
increased desertification,
crashing food systems, water scarcity,
famine, forced migration,
political instability, warfare, crisis.
That's a potential scenario
if we fail to take this seriously.
But, how far away is it?
to try and find out how far away it is.
The dunes here move southward at a pace of around 600 meters a year.
That's the Sahara eating up almost [two meters] a day of the arable land,
physically pushing people away from their homes.
Here I am -- I'm the second person on the left --
(Laughter)
with the elders in Gidan-Kara,
a tiny village outside of Sokoto.
as a huge dune threatened to swallow it.
So, they moved the entire village, hut by hut.
This is where the village used to be.
It took us about 10 minutes to climb up to the top of that dune,
which goes to show why they had to move to a safer location.
That's the kind of forced migration
that desertification can lead to.
If you happen to live close to the desert border,
you can pretty much calculate how long it will be
before you have to carry your kids away,
and abandon your home and your life as you know it.
And still, those extreme environments are very good places
if we want to stop the shifting sands.
Four years ago, 23 African countries
came together to create the Great Green Wall Sahara.
A fantastic project, the initial plan
called for a shelter belt of trees to be planted
right across the African continent,
from Mauritania in the west, all the way to Djibouti in the east.
If you want to stop a sand dune from moving,
what you need to make sure to do is to stop the grains
from avalanching over its crest.
And a good way of doing that, the most efficient way,
is to use some kind of sand catcher.
Trees or cacti are good for this.
But, one of the problems with planting trees is that
the people in these regions are so poor
that they chop them down for firewood.
and hoping that they won't get chopped down.
This sandstone wall that I'm proposing essentially does three things.
It adds roughness to the dune's surface,
to the texture of the dune's surface, binding the grains.
It provides a physical support structure for the trees,
and it creates physical spaces,
habitable spaces inside of the sand dunes.
If people live inside of the green barrier
they can help support the trees, protect them from humans,
and from some of the forces of nature.
Inside of the dunes we find shade.
We can start harvesting condensation,
and start greening the desert from within.
All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid,
and then excavate the sand,
and we have our architecture.
We can either excavate it by hand
or we can have the wind excavate it for us.
So, the wind carries the sand onto the site
and then it carries the redundant sand away from the structure for us.
how am I planning to solidify a sand dune?
How do we glue those grains of sand together?
And the answer is, perhaps, that you use these guys,
Bacillus pasteurii,
a micro-organism that is readily available in wetlands
and marshes, and does precisely that.
It takes a pile of loose sand
and it creates sandstone out of it.
These images from the American Society for Microbiology show us the process.
and it starts filling up the voids in between the grains.
A chemical process produces calcite,
which is a kind of natural cement
that binds the grains together.
The whole cementation process takes about 24 hours.
I learned about this from a professor at U.C. Davis called Jason DeJong.
He managed to do it in a mere 1,400 minutes.
Here I am, playing the part of the mad scientist,
working with the bugs at UCL in London,
trying to solidify them.
I'm not an economist, very much not,
but I did, quite literally, a back of the envelope calculation --
(Laughter)
-- and it seems that for a cubic meter of concrete
we would have to pay in the region of 90 dollars.
And, after an initial cost of 60 bucks to buy the bacteria,
which you'll never have to pay again,
one cubic meter of bacterial sand
would be about 11 dollars.
Well, I'll quickly show you two options.
The first is to create a kind of balloon structure,
fill it with bacteria, then allow the sand to wash over the balloon,
pop the balloon, as it were, disseminating the bacteria into the sand and solidifying it.
Then, a few years afterwards,
using permacultural strategies,
we green that part of the desert.
So, we pushed the piles down through the dune,
and we create an initial bacterial surface.
We then pull the piles up through the dune
and we're able to create almost any conceivable shape inside of the sand
with the sand acting as a mold as we go up.
So, we have a way of turning sand into sandstone,
and then creating these habitable spaces inside of the desert dunes.
Well, I was inspired, for my architectural form, by tafoni,
which look a little bit like this, this is a model representation of it.
These are cavernous rock structures that I found on the site in Sokoto.
And I realized that if I scaled them up, they would provide me
with good spatial qualities,
for ventilation, for thermal comfort, and for other things.
Now, part of the formal control over this structure
would be lost to nature, obviously,
as the bacteria do their work.
And I think this creates a kind of boundless beauty actually.
I think there is really something in that articulation
that is quite nice.
We see the result, the traces, if you like,
of the Bacillus pasteurii being harnessed to sculpt the desert
into these habitable environments.
this would spread uncontrollably,
and that the bacteria would kill everything in its way.
That's not true at all.
It's a natural process. It goes on in nature today,
and the bacteria die as soon as we stop feeding them.
So, there it is --
architectural anti-desertification structures
made from the desert itself.
Sand-stopping devices, made from sand.
The world is likely to lose one third of its arable land
by the end of the century.
In a period of unprecedented population growth
and increased food demands, this could prove disastrous.
And quite frankly, we're putting our heads in the sand.
But, if I had something like a TED wish,
it would be to actually get it built,
to start building this habitable wall,
this very, very long, but very narrow city in the desert,
built into the dunescape itself.
It's not only something that supports trees,
but something that connects people and countries together.
I would like to conclude by showing you an animation of the structure,
and leave you with a sentence by Jorge Luis Borges.
everything is built on sand,
but we must build as if the sand were stone."
political, practical, ethical, financial.
My design, as it takes you down the rabbit hole,
is fraught with many challenges
and difficulties in the real world.
But, it's a beginning, it's a vision.
As Borges would have it, it's the sand.
And I think now is really the time
to turn it into stone. Thank you.
(Applause)
As a culture, we tell ourselves lots of stories
about the future,
and where we might move forward from this point.
Some of those stories are that
somebody is just going to sort everything out for us.
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling.
Like all stories, it has a beginning.
My work, for a long time, has been involved in education,
in teaching people practical skills
for sustainability,
teaching people how to take responsibility
for growing some of their own food,
how to build buildings using local materials,
how to generate their own energy, and so on.
and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing.
But all my work for many years was focused
around the idea that sustainability
means basically looking at
the globalized economic growth model,
and moderating what comes in at one end,
and moderating the outputs at the other end.
And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things
which actually changed that profoundly.
I've got something here that I'm going to unveil,
which is one of the great marvels of the modern age.
And it's something so astounding and so astonishing
that I think maybe as I remove this cloth
a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate.
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic.
(Laughter)
This is a liter of oil.
distilled over a hundred million years of geological time,
ancient sunlight,
contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks
hard human manual labor --
equivalent to about 35 strong people
coming round and working for you.
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials,
medicine, modern clothing,
laptops, a whole range of different things.
It gives us an energy return that's unimaginable, historically.
We've based the design of our settlements,
our business models, our transport plans,
even the idea of economic growth, some would argue,
on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity.
and look over the span of history,
at what we might call the petroleum interval,
it's a short period in history
where we've discovered this extraordinary material,
and then based a whole way of life around it.
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain, at this stage,
we move from a time where our economic success,
our sense of individual prowess and well-being
is directly linked to how much of this we consume,
to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency
is our degree of vulnerability.
aren't going to be able to rely on the fact that
we're going to have this at our disposal forever.
For every four barrels of oil that we consume,
we only discover one.
And that gap continues to widen.
There is also the fact that the amount of energy
that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling.
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back
for every one that we put in to extract it.
Completely unprecedented, historically.
Already that's fallen to about 11.
And that's why, now,
the new breakthroughs, the new frontiers
in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta,
or at the bottom of the oceans.
But of those, 65 have already passed their peak.
The moment when the world on average passes this peak,
people wonder when that's going to happen.
And there is an emerging case
that maybe that was what happened last July
when the oil prices were so high.
and creativity and adaptability
that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place
is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate
when we have to design a creative way back down the other side?
No. But the thinking that we have to come up with
has to be based on a realistic assessment
of where we are.
is the other thing that underpins this transition approach.
But the thing that I notice, as I talk to climate scientists,
is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes,
as the data that's coming in,
which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about.
So the IPCC said
that we might see significant breakup
of the arctic ice in 2100, in their worst case scenario.
Actually, if current trends continue,
it could all be gone in five or 10 years' time.
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost
is released as the world warms,
it would offset all the savings that we need to make,
in carbon, over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change.
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization.
what might the stories be
that the generations further down the slope from us
are going to tell about us.
"The generation that lived at the top of the mountain,
that partied so hard, and so abused its inheritance."
And one of the ways I like to do that
is to look back at the stories people used to tell
before we had cheap oil, before we had fossil fuels,
and people relied on their own muscle, animal muscle energy,
or a little bit of wind, little bit of water energy.
the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on,
with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles,
a kind of travel completely unimaginable
to people without that kind of energy at their disposal.
where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words,
this pot would just make as much food as you liked,
without you having to do any work,
provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge.
Otherwise you'd flood your entire town with warm porridge.
The people who make shoes go to sleep, wake up in the morning,
and all the shoes are magically made for them.
It's something that was unimaginable to people then.
in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet.
We have the magic porridge pot
in the form of Walmart and Tesco.
And we have the elves in the form of China.
But we don't appreciate what an astonishing
thing that has been.
as we look forward about where we're going to go.
And I would argue that there are four. There is the idea of business as usual,
that the future will be like the present, just more of it.
But as we've seen over the last year, I think that's an idea
that is increasingly coming into question.
And in terms of climate change,
is something that is not actually feasible.
that actually somehow everything is so fragile
that it might just all unravel and collapse.
This is a popular story in some places.
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything,
that technology can somehow get us through this completely.
the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound
economic and energy crisis,
that a move to a knowledge economy
can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints,
the idea that we'll discover some fabulous new source of energy
that will mean we can sweep all concerns
about energy security to one side,
the idea that we can step off neatly
onto a completely renewable world.
We can't create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse.
And as we sit, exchanging free ideas with each other,
there are still people mining coal
in order to power the servers, extracting the minerals
to make all of those things.
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down
to check our email in the morning
is still transported at great distances,
usually at the expense of the local, more resilient
food systems that would have supplied that in the past,
which we've so effectively devalued and dismantled.
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands.
Energy and technology are not the same thing.
What I'm involved with is the transition response.
And this is really about looking the challenges
of peak oil and climate change square in the face,
and responding with a creativity and an adaptability
and an imagination that we really need.
It's something which has spread incredibly fast.
And it is something which has several characteristics.
It's open source. It's something which everybody who's involved with it
develops and passes on as they work with it.
It's self-organizing. There is no great central organization
that pushes this; people just pick up an idea
and they run with it, and they implement it where they are.
It's solutions-focused. It's very much looking at what people can do
where they are, to respond to this.
It's sensitive to place and to scale.
Transition groups in Chile, transition groups in the U.S., transition groups here,
what they're doing looks very different in every place that you go to.
It learns very much from its mistakes.
And it feels historic. It tries to create a sense
that this is a historic opportunity
to do something really extraordinary.
And it's a process which is really joyful.
People have a huge amount of fun doing this,
reconnecting with other people as they do it.
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience.
is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability.
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology.
And it's really about how systems,
settlements, withstand shock from the outside.
When they encounter shock from the outside
that they don't just unravel and fall to pieces.
And I think it's a more useful concept than sustainability, as I said.
at any one time, often sustainability tends to focus on
the energy efficiency of the freezers
and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in.
Looking through the lens of resilience,
we really question how we've let ourselves get into a situation
that's so vulnerable.
Resilience runs much deeper:
it's about building modularity into what we do,
building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us.
Market Gardeners Association, in 1897.
This is at a time when the city of Bristol,
which is quite close to here,
was surrounded by commercial market gardens,
which provided a significant amount of the food
that was consumed in the town, and created a lot of employment for people, as well.
There was a degree of resilience, if you like, at that time,
which we can now only look back on with envy.
So basically, you have a group of people who are excited by the idea.
They pick up some of the tools that we've developed.
They start to run an awareness-raising program
looking at how this might actually work in the town.
They show films, they give talks, and so on.
It's a process which is playful and creative
and informative.
Then they start to form working groups, looking at different aspects of this,
and then from that, there emerge a whole lot of projects
which then the transition project itself
starts to support and enable.
where I was teaching, and has since spread.
There are now over 200 formal transition projects.
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage.
They are mulling whether they're going to take it further.
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff.
But what do they actually do? You know, it's a kind of nice idea,
but what do they actually do on the ground?
you know, this isn't something which is going to do everything on its own.
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on.
We need national responses. We need local government responses.
But all of those things are going to be much easier
if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas
and leading from the front, making unelectable policies electable,
over the next 5 to 10 years.
like community-supported agriculture schemes,
urban food production, creating local food directories, and so on.
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies,
community-owned energy companies,
where the community can invest money into itself,
to start putting in place
the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need.
A lot of places are working with their local schools.
Newent in the Forest of Dean: big polytunnel they built for the school;
the kids are learning how to grow food.
Promoting recycling, things like garden-share,
that matches up people who don't have a garden
who would like to grow food, with people who have gardens they aren't using anymore.
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces.
And also starting to play around with the idea of
alternative currencies.
who have recently launched the Lewes Pound,
a currency that you can only spend within the town,
as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy.
You take it anywhere else, it's not worth anything.
But actually within the town you start to create these economic
cycles much more effectively.
which is basically to develop a plan B for the town.
Most of our local authorities, when they sit down to plan
for the next five, 10, 15, 20 years of a community,
still start by assuming that there will be more energy,
more cars, more housing,
more jobs, more growth, and so on.
What does it look like if that's not the case? And how can we embrace that
and actually come up with something that was actually more likely
to sustain everybody?
As a friend of mine says, "Life is a series of things you're not quite ready for."
And that's certainly been my experience with transition.
From three years ago, it just being an idea,
this has become something that has virally swept around the world.
We're getting a lot of interest from government. Ed Miliband,
the energy minister of this country, was invited to come to our recent conference
as a keynote listener.
Which he did --
(Laughter)
(Applause) --
and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea.
who have declared themselves transitional local authorities,
Leicestershire and Somerset. And in Stroud,
the transition group there, in effect, wrote the local government's food plan.
And the head of the council said,
"If we didn't have Transition Stroud, we would have to invent
all of that community infrastructure for the first time."
As we see the spread of it, we see national hubs emerging.
has funded Transition Scotland
as a national organization supporting the spread of this.
And we see it all over the place as well now.
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now,
but that things are already inevitably changing,
and what we need to do is to work creatively with that,
based on asking the right questions.
to the idea of stories.
Because I think stories are vital here.
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves,
we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here.
And one of the key things that transition does
is to pull those stories out of what people are doing.
Stories about the community that's produced
its own 21 pound note, for example,
the school that's turned its car park into a food garden,
the community that's founded its own energy company.
And for me, one of the great stories recently
was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House
to create a vegetable garden. Because the last time that was done,
when Eleanor Roosevelt did it,
it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States.
is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs
in order to thrive,
how can it be done in such a way
that drastically reduces its carbon emissions,
while also building resilience?
to have lived through the age of cheap oil.
I've been astonishingly lucky, we've been astonishingly lucky.
But let us honor what it has bought us,
and move forward from this point.
Because if we cling to it, and continue to assume
that it can underpin our choices,
the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable.
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us,
and that the Oil Age has done for us,
we are able to then begin the creation
of a world which is more resilient,
more nourishing,
and in which, we find ourselves fitter, more skilled
and more connected to each other.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Once upon a time,
at the age of 24,
I was a student at St. John's Medical College in Bangalore.
I was a guest student during one month
of a public health course.
And that changed my mindset forever.
The course was good, but it was not the course content
in itself that changed the mindset.
It was the brutal realization,
the first morning,
that the Indian students were better than me.
I loved statistics from a young age.
And I studied very much in Sweden.
I used to be in the upper quarter of all courses I attended.
But in St. John's, I was in the lower quarter.
And the fact was that Indian students
studied harder than we did in Sweden.
They read the textbook twice,
or three times or four times.
In Sweden we read it once and then we went partying.
that personal experience
was the first time in my life
that the mindset I grew up with
was changed.
And I realized that perhaps
the Western world will not continue
to dominate the world forever.
And I think many of you have the same sort of personal experience.
It's that realization of someone you meet
that really made you change your ideas about the world.
It's not the statistics, although I tried to make it funny.
here, onstage,
try to predict when that will happen --
that Asia will regain
its dominant position
as the leading part of the world,
as it used to be, over thousands of years.
And I will do that
by trying to predict precisely
at what year
the average income per person
in India, in China, will reach that of the West.
And I don't mean the whole economy,
because to grow an economy
of India to the size of U.K. --
that's a piece of cake, with one billion people.
But I want to see when will the average pay, the money
for each person, per month,
in India and China,
when will that have reached that of U.K. and the United States?
And you can see my map if I get it up here. You know?
I will start at 1858.
1858 was a year of great technological
advancement in the West.
That was the year when Queen Victoria
was able, for the first time, to communicate
with President Buchanan,
through the Transatlantic Telegraphic Cable.
And they were the first to "Twitter" transatlantically.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
And I've been able, through this wonderful Google and Internet,
to find the text of the telegram
sent back from President Buchanan to Queen Victoria.
And it ends like this: "This telegraph
is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion,
civilization, liberty and law throughout the world."
of what he meant with liberty, and liberty for whom.
And we will think about that
when we look at the wider picture of the world in 1858.
Because 1858
was also watershed year
in the history of Asia.
1858 was the year
when the courageous uprising
against the foreign occupation of India
was defeated by the British forces.
And India was up to 89 years more of foreign domination.
was the victory in the Opium War by the British forces.
And that meant that foreigners, as it said in the treaty,
were allowed to trade freely in China.
It meant paying with opium for Chinese goods.
was the year when Japan had to sign the Harris Treaty
and accept trade on favorable condition for the U.S.
And they were threatened by those black ships there,
that had been in Tokyo harbor over the last year.
But, Japan, in contrast to India and China,
maintained its national sovereignty.
And I will do that by bringing these bubbles
back to a Gapminder graph here,
where you can see each bubble is a country.
The size of the bubble here is the population.
On this axis, as I used to have income per person in comparable dollar.
And on that axis I have life expectancy, the health of people.
And I also bring an innovation here.
I have transformed the laser beam
into an ecological, recyclable version here, in green India.
Look here, 1858, India was here,
China was here, Japan was there,
United States and United Kingdom
was richer over there.
And I will start the world like this.
India was not always like this level.
Actually if we go back into the historical record,
there was a time hundreds of years ago
when the income per person in India and China
was even above that of Europe.
But 1850 had already been many, many years of foreign domination,
and India had been de-industrialized.
And you can see that the countries who were growing
their economy was United States and United Kingdom.
And they were also, by the end of the century, getting healthy,
and Japan was starting to catch up.
India was trying down here.
Can you see how it starts to move there?
But really, really natural sovereignty was good for Japan.
And Japan is trying to move up there.
United Kingdom, United States.
But careful now -- we are approaching the First World War.
And the First World War, you know,
we'll see a lot of deaths and economical problems here.
United Kingdom is going down.
And now comes the Spanish flu also.
And then after the First World War, they continue up.
Still under foreign domination, and without sovereignty,
India and China are down in the corner.
Not much has happened.
They have grown their population but not much more.
In the 1930's now, you can see
that Japan is going to a period of war,
with lower life expectancy.
And the Second World War was really a terrible event,
also economically for Japan.
But they did recover quite fast afterwards.
And we are moving into the new world.
In 1947 India finally
gained its independence.
And they could raise the Indian flag and become a sovereign nation,
but in very big difficulties down there.
in a way which surprised the world.
And what happened?
What happens in the after independence?
You can see that the health started to improve.
Children started to go to school.
Health services were provided.
This is the Great Leap Forward, when China fell down.
It was central planning by Mao Tse Tung.
China recovered. Then they said,
"Nevermore, stupid central planning."
But they went up here, and India was trying to follow.
And they were catching up indeed.
And both countries had the better health, but still
a very low economy.
and a new guy turned up from the left.
And it was Deng Xiaoping coming out here.
And he said, "Doesn't matter
if a cat is white or black,
as long as it catches mice."
Because catching mice
is what the two cats wanted to do.
And you can see the two cats being here,
China and India, wanting to catch the mices over there, you know.
And they decided to go not only for health and education,
but also starting to grow their economy.
And the market reformer was successful there.
In '92 India follows with a market reform.
And they go quite closely together,
and you can see that the similarity with India and China,
in many ways, are greater than the differences with them.
There they are today.
(Applause)
the averages there -- this is the average of China.
If I would split China, look here,
Shanghai has already catched up.
Shanghai is already there.
And it's healthier than the United States.
But on the other hand, Guizhou, one of the poorest
inland provinces of China, is there.
And if I split Guizhou into urban and rural,
the rural part of Guizhou goes down there.
You see this enormous inequity in China,
in the midst of fast economic growth.
you have another type of inequity, actually, in India.
The geographical, macro-geographical difference is not so big.
Uttar Pradesh, the biggest of the states here,
is poorer and has a lower health than the rest of India.
Kerala is flying on top there,
matching United States in health,
but not in economy.
And here, Maharashtra, with Mumbai,
is forging forward.
Now in India, the big inequities are within the state,
rather than between the states.
And that is not a bad thing, in itself.
If you have a lot inequity, macro-geographical inequities
can be more difficult in the long term to deal with,
than if it is in the same area where you have a growth center
relatively close to where poor people are living.
(Laughter)
Oh, they broke my frame.
Washington, D.C. went out here.
My friends at Gapminder wanted me to show this
because there is a new leader in Washington
who is really concerned about the health system.
And I can understand him, because Washington, D.C.
is so rich over there
but they are not as healthy as Kerala.
It's quite interesting, isn't it?
(Applause)
I can see a business opportunity for Kerala,
helping fix the health system in the United States.
And when you see the two giant cats here, pushing forward,
you see that in between them
and ahead of them,
is the whole emerging economies of the world,
which Thomas Friedman so correctly called the "flat world."
You can see that in health and education,
a large part of the world population is putting forward,
but in Africa, and other parts,
as in rural Guizhou in China,
there is still people with low health and very low economy.
We have an enormous disparity in the world.
But most of the world in the middle are pushing forwards very fast.
When will it catch up? I have to go back to very conventional graph.
I will show income per person on this axis instead,
poor down here, rich up there.
And then time here, from 1858
I start the world.
And we shall see what will happen with these countries.
You see, China under foreign domination
actually lowered their income and came down to the Indian level here.
Whereas U.K. and United States is getting richer and richer.
And after Second World War, United States is richer than U.K.
But independence is coming here.
Growth is starting, economic reform.
Growth is faster, and with projection from IMF
you can see where you expect them to be in 2014.
Look at, look at the United States.
Can you see the bubble?
The bubbles, not my bubbles,
but the financial bubbles.
That's the dot com bubble. This is the Lehman Brothers doorstep there.
You see it came down there.
And it seems this is another rock coming down there, you know.
So they doesn't seem to go this way, these countries.
They seem to go in a more humble growth way, you know.
And people interested in growth
are turning their eyes towards Asia.
You see, Japan did it like that.
We add Japan to it.
And there is no doubt that fast catch up
can take place.
Can you see here what Japan did?
Japan did it like this, until full catch up,
and then they follow with the other high-income economies.
But the real projections for those ones,
I would like to give it like this.
Can be worse, can be better.
It's always difficult to predict, especially about the future.
Now, a historian tells me it's even more difficult to predict about the past.
Inequalities in China and India
I consider really the big obstacle
because to bring the entire population into growth and prosperity
is what will create a domestic market,
what will avoid social instability,
and which will make use of the entire capacity
of the population.
So, social investments in health, education and infrastructure,
and electricity is really what is needed in India and China.
within India telling us that the climate is changing,
and actions has to be taken,
otherwise China and India would be the countries
most to suffer from climate change.
And I consider India and China the best partners in the world
in a good global climate policy.
But they ain't going to pay
for what others, who have more money,
have largely created, and I can agree on that.
Will the former rich countries really accept
a completely changed world economy,
and a shift of power away from where it has been
the last 50 to 100 to 150 years,
back to Asia?
And will Asia be able to handle that
new position of being in charge
of being the most mighty, and the governors of the world?
So, always avoid war,
because that always pushes human beings backward.
Now if these inequalities, climate and war can be avoided,
get ready for a world in equity,
because this is what seems to be happening.
1972, that Indians can be much better than Swedes,
is just about to happen.
And it will happen precisely
the year 2048
in the later part of the summer, in July,
more precisely, the 27th of July.
(Applause)
The 27th of July, 2048
is my 100th birthday.
(Laughter)
And I expect to speak
in the first session of the 39th TED India.
Get your bookings in time. Thank you very much.
I'm going to talk
about some of my discoveries
around the world through my work.
These are not discoveries of planets
or new technologies
or science.
They're discoveries of people
and the way people are, and new leadership.
Benki is a leader of the Ashaninka Nation.
His people live in Brazil
and in Peru.
Benki comes from a village
so remote up in the Amazon
that to get there, either you have to fly
and land on water,
or go by canoe for several days.
I met Benki three years ago in Sao Paulo
when I'd brought him and other leaders
from indigenous peoples
to meet with me and leaders from around the world,
because we wanted to learn from each other.
We wanted to share our stories with each other.
are known throughout South America
for their dignity, their spirit
and their resistance,
starting with the Incas
and continuing through the 19th century
with the rubber tappers.
Today's biggest threat to the Ashaninka people
and to Benki
comes from illegal logging --
the people who come into the beautiful forest
and cut down ancient mahogany trees,
float them down the river to world markets.
Benki knew this.
He could see what was happening to his forest, to his environment,
because he was taken under his grandfather's wing
when he was only two years old
to begin to learn about the forest
and the way of life of his people.
His grandfather died when he was only 10.
And at that young age, 10 years old,
Benki became the paje of his community.
Now, in the Ashaninka tradition and culture,
the paje is the most important
person in the community.
This is the person who contains within him
all the knowledge, all the wisdom
of centuries and centuries of life,
and not just about his people,
but about everything that his people's survival depended on:
the trees, the birds,
the water, the soil, the forest.
So when he was only 10 and he became the paje,
he began to lead his people.
He began to talk to them
about the forest that they needed to protect,
the way of life they needed to nurture.
He explained to them
that it was not a question of survival of the fittest;
it was a question of understanding
what they needed to survive
and to protect that.
when he was a young man of 18,
Benki left the forest for the first time.
He went 3,000 miles on an odyssey to Rio
to the Earth Summit
to tell the world what was happening
in his tiny, little corner.
And he went because he hoped the world would listen.
Some did, not everybody.
But if you can imagine this young man
with his headdress and his flowing robe,
learning a new language, Portuguese,
not to mention English,
going to Rio,
building a bridge
to reach out to people he'd never met before --
a pretty hostile world.
But he wasn't dismayed.
new technologies, new research,
new ways of understanding what was going on.
Since that time,
he's continued to work with his people,
and not only the Ashaninka Nation,
but all the peoples of the Amazon and beyond.
He's built schools
to teach children to care for the forest.
Together, he's led the reforestation
of over 25 percent of the land
that had been destroyed by the loggers.
He's created a cooperative
to help people diversify their livelihoods.
And he's brought the internet and satellite technology
to the forest --
both so that people themselves
could monitor the deforestation,
but also that he could speak from the forest
to the rest of the world.
If you were to meet Benki
and ask him, "Why are you doing this?
Why are you putting yourself at risk?
Why are you making yourself vulnerable
to what is often a hostile world?"
he would tell you,
as he told me,
"I asked myself," he said,
"What did my grandparents and my great-grandparents do
to protect the forest for me?
And what am I doing?"
I wonder what our grandchildren
and our great-grandchildren,
when they ask themselves that question,
I wonder how they will answer.
For me, the world is veering
towards a future we don't much want
when we really think about it deep inside.
It's a future we don't know the details of,
but it's a future that has signs,
just like Benki saw the signs around him.
We know we are running out of what we need.
We're running out of fresh water.
We're running out of fossil fuels.
We're running out of land.
We know climate change is going to affect all of us.
We don't know how, but we know it will.
And we know that there will be more of us than ever before --
five times as many people in 40 years
than 60 years ago.
We are running out of what we need.
And we also know
that the world has changed in other ways,
that since 1960
there are one-third as many new countries
that exist as independent entities on the planet.
Egos, systems of government --
figuring it out --
massive change.
And in addition to that,
we know that five other really big countries
are going to have a say in the future,
a say we haven't even really started to hear yet --
China, India,
Russia, South Africa
and Benki's own Brazil,
where Benki got his civil rights
only in the 1988 constitution.
You know more than Benki knew when he left his forest
and went 3,000 miles.
You also know
that we can't just keep doing what we've always done,
because we'll get the results
we've always gotten.
And this reminds me of something I understand
Lord Salisbury said to Queen Victoria over a hundred years ago,
when she was pressing him, "Please change."
He said, "Change?
Why change?
Things are bad enough as they are."
We have to change.
It's imperative to me, when I look around the world,
that we need to change ourselves.
We need new models of what it means to be a leader.
We need new models
of being a leader and a human in the world.
Now I don't admit to that
to anybody but my very close friends.
But for the past eight years,
I've done something completely different.
My work has taken me around the world,
where I've had the real privilege
of meeting people like Benki
and many others who are making change happen
in their communities --
people who see the world differently,
who are asking different questions,
who have different answers,
who understand the filters that they wear
when they go out into the world.
Sanghamitra comes from Bangalore.
I met Sanghamitra eight years ago
when I was in Bangalore
organizing a workshop with leaders of different NGO's
working in some of the hardest aspects of society.
Sanghamitra didn't start life
as a leader of an NGO,
she started her career as university professor,
teaching English literature.
But she realized that she was much too detached from the world doing that.
She loved it, but she was too detached.
And so in 1993,
a long time ago,
she decided to start a new organization
called Samraksha
focused on one of the hardest areas,
one of the hardest issues in India --
anywhere in the world at the time --
HIV/AIDS.
Since that time, Samraksha has grown
from strength to strength
and is now one of the leading health NGO's in India.
But if you just think about the state of the world
and knowledge of HIV/AIDS
in 1993 --
in India at that time it was skyrocketing
and nobody understood why,
and everyone was actually very, very afraid.
Today there are still three million
HIV-positive people in India.
That's the second largest population in the world.
"How did you get from English literature
to HIV/AIDS?"
not an obvious path,
she said to me,
"It's all connected.
Literature makes one sensitive,
sensitive to people,
to their dreams and to their ideas."
Since that time, under her leadership,
Samraksha has been a pioneer
in all fields related
to HIV/AIDS.
They have respite homes, the first,
the first care centers,
the first counseling services --
and not just in urban, 7-million-population Bangalore,
but in the hardest to reach villages
in the state of Karnataka.
Even that wasn't enough.
She wanted to change policy at the government level.
10 of their programs that she pioneered
are now government policy and funded by the government.
They take care of 20,000-odd people today
in over 1,000 villages around Karnataka.
Murali Krishna comes from one of those villages.
He lost his wife to AIDS a couple of years ago,
and he's HIV-positive.
But he saw the work, the care,
the compassion
that Sanghamitra and her team brought to the village,
and he wanted to be part of it.
He's a Leaders' Quest fellow, and that helps him with his work.
They've pioneered a different approach to villages.
Instead of handing out information in pamphlets,
as is so often the case,
they bring theater troupes,
songs, music, dance.
And they sit around,
and they talk about dreams.
she had just come back from two weeks in the villages,
and she had a real breakthrough.
They were sitting in a circle, talking about the dreams for the village.
And the young women in the village
spoke up and said, "We've changed our dream.
Our dream
is for our partners, our husbands,
not to be given to us because of a horoscope,
but to be given to us
because they've been tested for HIV."
If you are lucky enough to meet Sanghamitra
and ask her why and how,
how have you achieved so much?
She would look at you
and very quietly, very softly say,
"It just happened.
It's the spirit inside."
Jianchuan comes from Sichuan Province
in southwest China.
He was born in 1957,
and you can imagine what his childhood
looked like and felt like,
and what his life has been like
over the last 50 tumultuous years.
He's been a soldier, a teacher,
a politician, a vice-mayor
and a business man.
But if you sat down and asked him, "Who are you really,
and what do you do?"
He would tell you, "I'm a collector,
and I curate a museum."
I was lucky; I had heard about him for years,
and I finally met him earlier this year
at his museum in Chengdu.
starting when he was four or five in the early 1960's.
Now, just think of the early 1960's in China.
Over a lifetime, through everything,
through the Cultural Revolution and everything afterward,
he's kept collecting,
so that he now has over eight million pieces
in his museums
documenting contemporary Chinese history.
These are pieces that you won't find anywhere else in the world,
in part because they document parts of history
Chinese choose to forget.
For example, he's got over one million pieces
documenting the Sino-Japanese War,
a war that's not talked about in China very much
and whose heroes are not honored.
Why did he do all this?
Because he thought
a nation should never repeat the mistakes of the past.
slightly larger than life bronze statues
of the heroes of the Sino-Japanese War,
including those Chinese
who then fought with each other
and left mainland China to go to Taiwan,
to commemorating all the unknown,
ordinary soldiers who survived,
by asking them to take prints of their hands,
he is making sure -- one man is making sure --
that history is not forgotten.
But it's not just Chinese heroes he cares about.
This building contains the world's largest collection
of documents and artifacts
commemorating the U.S. role
in fighting on the Chinese side
in that long war --
the Flying Tigers.
He has nine other buildings --
that are already open to the public --
filled to the rafters with artifacts
documenting contemporary Chinese history.
Two of the most sensitive buildings
include a lifetime of collection
about the Cultural Revolution,
a period that actually most Chinese
would prefer to forget.
But he doesn't want his nation
ever to forget.
and they inspire me because they show us
what is possible when you change the way
you look at the world,
change the way you look at your place in the world.
They looked outside,
and then they changed what was on the inside.
They didn't go to business school.
They didn't read a manual, "How to Be a Good Leader
in 10 Easy Steps."
But they have qualities we'd all recognize.
They have drive, passion, commitment.
They've gone away
from what they did before,
and they've gone
to something they didn't know.
They've tried to connect worlds
they didn't know existed before.
They've built bridges, and they've walked across them.
They have a sense of the great arc of time
and their tiny place in it.
They know people have come before them
and will follow them.
And they know that they're part of a whole,
that they depend on other people.
It's not about them, they know that,
but it has to start with them.
And they have humility.
It just happens.
We know it takes a lot to make it happen,
and we know the direction the world is going in.
So I think we need succession planning
on a global basis.
We can't wait for the next generation, the new joiners,
to come in and learn how to be the good leaders we need.
I think it has to start with us.
And we know, just like they knew,
how hard it is.
But the good news is that we don't have to figure it out as we go along;
we have models, we have examples,
like Benki and Sanghamitra and Jianchuan.
We can look at what they've done, if we look.
We can learn from what they've learned.
We can change the way we see ourselves in the world.
And if we're lucky,
we can change the way
our great-grandchildren
will answer Benki's question.
As technology progresses,
and as it advances,
many of us assume that these advances
make us more intelligent,
make us smarter and more connected to the world.
And what I'd like to argue
is that that's not necessarily the case,
as progress is simply a word for change,
and with change you gain something,
but you also lose something.
is to show you how technology has dealt with
a very simple, a very common, an everyday question.
And that question is this.
What time is it? What time is it?
If you glance at your iPhone, it's so simple to tell the time.
But, I'd like to ask you, how would you tell the time
if you didn't have an iPhone?
How would you tell the time, say, 600 years ago?
How would you do it?
that's called an astrolabe.
So, an astrolabe is relatively unknown in today's world.
But, at the time, in the 13th century,
it was the gadget of the day.
It was the world's first popular computer.
And it was a device that, in fact, is a model of the sky.
So, the different parts of the astrolabe, in this particular type,
the rete corresponds to the positions of the stars.
The plate corresponds to a coordinate system.
And the mater has some scales and puts it all together.
you would know how to not only use the astrolabe,
you would also know how to make an astrolabe.
And we know this because the first treatise on the astrolabe,
the first technical manual in the English language,
was written by Geoffrey Chaucer.
Yes, that Geoffrey Chaucer, in 1391,
to his little Lewis, his 11-year-old son.
And in this book, little Lewis would know the big idea.
is this thing called stereographic projection.
And basically, the concept is,
how do you represent the three-dimensional image
of the night sky that surrounds us
onto a flat, portable, two-dimensional surface.
The idea is actually relatively simple.
Imagine that that Earth is at the center of the universe,
and surrounding it is the sky projected onto a sphere.
Each point on the surface of the sphere
is mapped through the bottom pole,
onto a flat surface, where it is then recorded.
The ecliptic, which is the path of the sun, moon, and planets
correspond to an offset circle.
The bright stars correspond to little daggers on the rete.
And the altitude corresponds to the plate system.
Now, the real genius of the astrolabe is not just the projection.
The real genius is that it brings together two coordinate systems
so they fit perfectly.
There is the position of the sun, moon and planets on the movable rete.
And then there is their location on the sky
as seen from a certain latitude on the back plate. Okay?
Well, let me first back up for a moment.
This is an astrolabe. Pretty impressive, isn't it?
And so, this astrolabe is on loan from us
from the Oxford School of -- Museum of History.
And you can see the different components.
This is the mater, the scales on the back.
This is the rete. Okay. Do you see that?
That's the movable part of the sky.
And in the back you can see
a spider web pattern.
And that spider web pattern corresponds to the local coordinates in the sky.
This is a rule device. And on the back
are some other devices, measuring tools
and scales, to be able to make some calculations. Okay?
For my thesis I actually built one of these out of paper.
And this one, this is a replica
from a 15th-century device.
And it's worth probably about three MacBook Pros.
But a real one would cost about as much as my house,
and the house next to it, and actually every house on the block,
on both sides of the street,
maybe a school thrown in, and some -- you know, a church.
They are just incredibly expensive.
So let's go to step one.
First thing that you do is you select a star
in the night sky, if you're telling time at night.
So, tonight, if it's clear you'll be able to see the summer triangle.
And there is a bright star called Deneb. So let's select Deneb.
Second, is you measure the altitude of Deneb.
So, step two, I hold the device up,
and then I sight its altitude there
so I can see it clearly now.
And then I measure its altitude.
So, it's about 26 degrees. You can't see it from over there.
Step three is identify the star on the front of the device.
Deneb is there. I can tell.
Step four is I then move the rete,
move the sky, so the altitude of the star
corresponds to the scale on the back.
Okay, so when that happens
everything lines up.
I have here a model of the sky
that corresponds to the real sky. Okay?
So, it is, in a sense,
holding a model of the universe in my hands.
And then finally, I take a rule,
and move the rule to a date line
which then tells me the time here.
Right. So, that's how the device is used.
(Laughter)
"That's a lot of work, isn't it? Isn't it a ton of work to be able to tell the time?"
as you glance at your iPod to just check out the time.
But there is a difference between the two, because with your iPod
you can tell -- or your iPhone, you can tell exactly
what the time is, with precision.
The way little Lewis would tell the time
is by a picture of the sky.
He would know where things would fit in the sky.
He would not only know what time it was,
he would also know where the sun would rise,
and how it would move across the sky.
He would know what time the sun would rise, and what time it would set.
And he would know that for essentially every celestial object
in the heavens.
and computer user interface design,
there is a term called affordances.
So, affordances are the qualities of an object
that allow us to perform an action with it.
And what the astrolabe does is it allows us,
it affords us, to connect to the night sky,
to look up into the night sky and be much more --
to see the visible and the invisible together.
So, that's just one use. Incredible,
there is probably 350, 400 uses.
In fact, there is a text, and that has over a thousand uses
of this first computer.
for terrestrial navigation.
You can survey with it. The city of Baghdad was surveyed with it.
It can be used for calculating mathematical equations of all different types.
And it would take a full university course to illustrate it.
Astrolabes have an incredible history.
They are over 2,000 years old.
The concept of stereographic projection
originated in 330 B.C.
sizes and shapes and forms.
There is portable ones. There is large display ones.
And I think what is common to all astrolabes
is that they are beautiful works of art.
There is a quality of craftsmanship and precision
that is just astonishing and remarkable.
So, the earliest retes, for example, were very simple and primitive.
And advancing retes became cultural emblems.
This is one from Oxford.
And I find this one really extraordinary because the rete pattern
is completely symmetrical,
and it accurately maps a completely asymmetrical, or random sky.
How cool is that? This is just amazing.
Probably not one made of brass. He would have one made out of wood,
or paper. And the vast majority of this first computer
was a portable device
that you could keep in the back of your pocket.
So, what does the astrolabe inspire?
Well, I think the first thing is that
it reminds us just how resourceful people were,
our forebears were, years and years ago.
It's just an incredible device.
Every technology is transformed and moved by others.
And what we gain with a new technology, of course,
is precision and accuracy.
But what we lose, I think, is
an accurate -- a felt sense
of the sky, a sense of context.
Knowing the sky, knowing your relationship with the sky,
is the center of the real answer
to knowing what time it is.
And so, what can you learn from these devices?
Well, primarily that there is a subtle knowledge
that we can connect with the world.
And astrolabes return us to this subtle sense
of how things all fit together,
and also how we connect to the world.
Thanks very much.
To understand the business of mythology
and what a Chief Belief Officer is supposed to do,
you have to hear a story
of Ganesha,
the elephant-headed god
who is the scribe of storytellers,
and his brother,
the athletic warlord of the gods,
Kartikeya.
The two brothers one day decided to go on a race,
three times around the world.
Kartikeya leapt on his peacock
and flew around the continents
and the mountains and the oceans.
He went around once,
he went around twice,
he went around thrice.
But his brother, Ganesha,
simply walked around his parents
once, twice, thrice,
and said, "I won."
"How come?" said Kartikeya.
And Ganesha said,
"You went around 'the world.'
I went around 'my world.'"
What matters more?
you understand the difference between logos and mythos.
'The world' is objective,
logical, universal, factual,
scientific.
'My world' is subjective.
It's emotional. It's personal.
It's perceptions, thoughts, feelings, dreams.
It is the belief system that we carry.
It's the myth that we live in.
how the sun rises,
how we are born.
'My world' tells us why the sun rises,
why we were born.
Every culture is trying to understand itself:
"Why do we exist?"
And every culture comes up with its own understanding of life,
its own customized version of mythology.
and this understanding of our ancestors
is transmitted generation from generation
in the form of stories, symbols and rituals,
which are always indifferent to rationality.
And so, when you study it, you realize
that different people of the world
have a different understanding of the world.
Different people see things differently --
different viewpoints.
and my world is always better than your world,
because my world, you see, is rational
and yours is superstition.
Yours is faith.
Yours is illogical.
This is the root of the clash of civilizations.
It took place, once, in 326 B.C.
on the banks of a river called the Indus,
now in Pakistan.
This river lends itself to India's name.
India. Indus.
met there what he called a "gymnosophist,"
which means "the naked, wise man."
We don't know who he was.
Perhaps he was a Jain monk,
like Bahubali over here,
the Gomateshwara Bahubali
whose image is not far from Mysore.
Or perhaps he was just a yogi
who was sitting on a rock, staring at the sky
and the sun and the moon.
and the gymnosophist answered,
"I'm experiencing nothingness."
Then the gymnosophist asked,
"What are you doing?"
and Alexander said, "I am conquering the world."
And they both laughed.
Each one thought that the other was a fool.
The gymnosophist said, "Why is he conquering the world?
It's pointless."
And Alexander thought,
"Why is he sitting around, doing nothing?
What a waste of a life."
we have to understand
the subjective truth of Alexander --
his myth, and the mythology that constructed it.
Alexander's mother, his parents, his teacher Aristotle
told him the story of Homer's "Iliad."
They told him of a great hero called Achilles,
who, when he participated in battle, victory was assured,
but when he withdrew from the battle,
defeat was inevitable.
"Achilles was a man who could shape history,
a man of destiny,
and this is what you should be, Alexander."
That's what he heard.
You should not be Sisyphus,
who rolls a rock up a mountain all day
only to find the boulder rolled down at night.
Don't live a life which is monotonous,
mediocre, meaningless.
Be spectacular! --
like the Greek heroes,
like Jason, who went across the sea
with the Argonauts and fetched the Golden Fleece.
Be spectacular like Theseus,
who entered the labyrinth and killed the bull-headed Minotaur.
When you play in a race, win! --
because when you win, the exhilaration of victory
is the closest you will come to the ambrosia of the gods."
you live only once,
and when you die, you have to cross the River Styx.
And if you have lived an extraordinary life,
you will be welcomed to Elysium,
or what the French call "Champs-Élysées" --
(Laughter) --
the heaven of the heroes.
He heard a very different story.
He heard of a man called Bharat,
after whom India is called Bhārata.
Bharat also conquered the world.
And then he went to the top-most peak
of the greatest mountain of the center of the world
called Meru.
And he wanted to hoist his flag to say,
"I was here first."
But when he reached the mountain peak,
he found the peak covered with countless flags
of world-conquerors before him,
each one claiming "'I was here first' ...
that's what I thought until I came here."
And suddenly, in this canvas of infinity,
Bharat felt insignificant.
This was the mythology of the gymnosophist.
and Krishna, Govinda Hari.
But they were not two characters on two different adventures.
They were two lifetimes of the same hero.
When the Ramayana ends the Mahabharata begins.
When Ram dies, Krishna is born.
When Krishna dies, eventually he will be back as Ram.
that separates the land of the living from the land of the dead.
But you don't cross it once.
You go to and fro endlessly.
It was called the Vaitarani.
You go again and again and again.
Because, you see,
nothing lasts forever in India, not even death.
And so, you have these grand rituals
where great images of mother goddesses are built
and worshiped for 10 days ...
And what do you do at the end of 10 days?
You dunk it in the river.
Because it has to end.
And next year, she will come back.
What goes around always comes around,
and this rule applies not just to man,
but also the gods.
You see, the gods
have to come back again and again and again
as Ram, as Krishna.
Not only do they live infinite lives,
but the same life is lived infinite times
till you get to the point of it all.
"Groundhog Day."
(Laughter)
Which is right?
Two different mythologies, two different ways of looking at the world.
One linear, one cyclical.
One believes this is the one and only life.
The other believes this is one of many lives.
And so, the denominator of Alexander's life was one.
So, the value of his life was the sum total
of his achievements.
The denominator of the gymnosophist's life was infinity.
So, no matter what he did,
it was always zero.
And I believe it is this mythological paradigm
that inspired Indian mathematicians
to discover the number zero.
Who knows?
If Alexander's belief influenced his behavior,
if the gymnosophist's belief influences his behavior,
then it was bound to influence the business they were in.
You see, what is business
but the result of how the market behaves
and how the organization behaves?
And if you look at cultures around the world,
all you have to do is understand the mythology
and you will see how they behave and how they do business.
If you live only once, in one-life cultures around the world,
you will see an obsession with binary logic,
absolute truth, standardization,
absoluteness, linear patterns in design.
But if you look at cultures which have cyclical
and based on infinite lives, you will see a comfort with fuzzy logic,
with opinion,
with contextual thinking,
with everything is relative, sort of --
(Laughter)
mostly.
(Laughter)
how linear she is in her performance.
And then look at the Indian classical dancer,
the Kuchipudi dancer, the Bharatanatyam dancer,
curvaceous.
(Laughter)
Standard business model:
vision, mission, values, processes.
Sounds very much like the journey through
the wilderness to the promised land,
with the commandments held by the leader.
And if you comply, you will go to heaven.
There are many promised lands,
depending on your station in society,
depending on your stage of life.
You see, businesses are not run as institutions,
by the idiosyncrasies of individuals.
It's always about taste.
It's always about my taste.
does not have the concept of harmony.
There is no orchestra conductor.
There is one performer standing there, and everybody follows.
And you can never replicate that performance twice.
It is not about documentation and contract.
It's about conversation and faith.
It's not about compliance. It's about setting,
getting the job done, by bending or breaking the rules --
just look at your Indian people around here,
you'll see them smile; they know what it is.
(Laughter)
And then look at people who have done business in India,
you'll see the exasperation on their faces.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
is based on a cyclical world view.
So, it's rapidly changing, highly diverse,
chaotic, ambiguous, unpredictable.
And people are okay with it.
And then globalization is taking place.
The demands of modern institutional thinking is coming in.
Which is rooted in one-life culture.
And a clash is going to take place,
like on the banks of the Indus.
It is bound to happen.
I did not want to study surgery. Don't ask me why.
I love mythology too much.
I wanted to learn mythology. But there is nowhere you can study.
So, I had to teach it to myself.
And mythology does not pay, well, until now.
(Laughter)
So, I had to take up a job. And I worked in the pharma industry.
And I worked in the healthcare industry.
And I worked as a marketing guy, and a sales guy,
and a knowledge guy, and a content guy, and a training guy.
I even was a business consultant, doing strategies and tactics.
And I would see the exasperation
between my American and European colleagues,
when they were dealing with India.
to invoice hospitals.
Step A. Step B. Step C. Mostly.
(Laughter)
How do you parameterize "mostly"?
How do you put it in a nice little software? You can't.
But nobody was interested in listening to it,
you see, until I met Kishore Biyani of the Future group.
You see, he has established the largest retail chain, called Big Bazaar.
And there are more than 200 formats,
across 50 cities and towns of India.
And he was dealing with diverse and dynamic markets.
And he knew very intuitively,
that best practices,
developed in Japan and China and Europe and America
will not work in India.
He knew that institutional thinking doesn't work in India. Individual thinking does.
He had an intuitive understanding of the mythic structure of India.
"All I want to do is align belief."
Sounds so simple.
But belief is not measurable.
You can't measure it. You can't manage it.
So, how do you construct belief?
How do you enhance the sensitivity of people to Indian-ness.
Even if you are Indian, it is not very explicit, it is not very obvious.
which is, develop stories, symbols and rituals.
And I will share one of the rituals with you.
You see it is based on the Hindu ritual of Darshan.
Hindus don't have the concept of commandments.
So, there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life.
So, you're not really sure how you stand in front of God.
So, when you go to the temple, all you seek is an audience with God.
You want to see God.
And you want God to see you, and hence the gods have very large eyes,
large unblinking eyes,
sometimes made of silver,
so they look at you.
Because you don't know whether you're right or wrong, and so all you seek
is divine empathy.
"Just know where I came from, why I did the Jugaad."
(Laughter)
"Why did I do the setting,
why I don't care for the processes. Just understand me, please."
After a leader completes his training and is about to take over the store,
we blindfold him, we surround him with the stakeholders,
the customer, his family, his team, his boss.
You read out his KRA, his KPI, you give him the keys,
and then you remove the blindfold.
And invariably, you see a tear,
because the penny has dropped.
He realizes that to succeed,
he does not have to be a "professional,"
he does not have to cut out his emotions,
he has to include all these people
in his world to succeed, to make them happy,
to make the boss happy, to make everyone happy.
The customer is happy, because the customer is God.
behavior will happen, business will happen.
And it has.
So, then we come back to Alexander
and to the gymnosophist.
And everybody asks me, "Which is the better way, this way or that way?"
And it's a very dangerous question,
because it leads you to the path of fundamentalism and violence.
So, I will not answer the question.
What I will give you is an Indian answer,
the Indian head-shake.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
depending on the outcome,
choose your paradigm.
You see, because both the paradigms are human constructions.
They are cultural creations,
not natural phenomena.
And so the next time you meet someone, a stranger,
one request:
Understand that you live in the subjective truth,
and so does he.
Understand it.
And when you understand it you will discover something spectacular.
You will discover that within infinite myths
lies the eternal truth.
Who sees it all?
Varuna has but a thousand eyes.
Indra, a hundred.
You and I, only two.
Thank you. Namaste.
(Applause)
We grew up
interacting with the physical objects around us.
Unlike most of our computing devices,
one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing,
and that is gestures:
how we manipulate these objects,
how we use these objects in everyday life.
We use gestures not only to interact with these objects,
but we also use them to interact with each other.
in India I don't need to teach a kid that this means
"four runs" in cricket.
It comes as a part of our everyday learning.
and how we use these objects,
can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world.
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse,
why can I not use my computer
in the same way that I interact in the physical world?
and it literally started with a mouse on my desk.
Most of you might be aware that, in those days,
the mouse used to come with a ball inside,
and there were two rollers
that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving,
and, accordingly, where the mouse is moving.
So, I was interested in these two rollers,
and I actually wanted more, so I borrowed another mouse from a friend --
never returned to him --
and I now had four rollers.
Interestingly, what I did with these rollers is,
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs.
What I got is basically a gesture-interface device
that actually acts as a motion-sensing device
made for two dollars.
So, here, whatever movement I do in my physical world
is actually replicated inside the digital world
just using this small device that I made, around eight years back,
in 2000.
I thought, "Why can I not connect
the normal interface of a physical sticky note
to the digital world?"
A message written on a sticky note to my mom,
on paper,
can come to an SMS,
or maybe a meeting reminder
automatically syncs with my digital calendar --
a to-do list that automatically syncs with you.
But you can also search in the digital world,
or maybe you can write a query, saying,
"What is Dr. Smith's address?"
and this small system actually prints it out --
I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions.
not only think in three dimensions,
but they can actually draw,
so that it's more intuitive to use that way.
but in the physical world?"
Rather than typing a keyword to find something,
I put my objects on top of it.
If I put a boarding pass, it will show me where the flight gate is.
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee,
or where you can trash the cup.
because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly.
Among all these experiments,
there was one thing in common:
I was trying to bring a part of the physical world
or any of the intuitiveness of real life,
What we are interested in is information.
We want to know about things.
We want to know about dynamic things going around.
I started thinking, "Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way?"
and paint the physical world with that digital information?"
and take that to my everyday objects, everyday life
so that I don't need to learn the new language
I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head.
I think that's why this is called a head-mounted projector, isn't it?
I took it very literally,
and took my bike helmet,
put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely.
So now, what I can do --
I can augment the world around me with this digital information.
Later, we moved to a much better,
consumer-oriented pendant version of that,
that many of you now know as the SixthSense device.
is that you can carry your digital world with you
wherever you go.
You can start using any surface, any wall around you,
as an interface.
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures.
Whatever you're doing with your hands,
it's understanding that gesture.
You can start painting on any wall.
You stop by a wall, and start painting on that wall.
But we are not only tracking one finger, here.
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands,
so you can actually use both of your hands to zoom into or zoom out
of a map just by pinching all present.
is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition
and so many other small algorithms are going on inside.
So, technically, it's a little bit complex,
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket,
you can just do the gesture of taking a photo,
and it takes a photo for you.
and start browsing those photos
where computing will actually merge with the physical world.
And, of course, if you don't have any surface,
you can start using your palm for simple operations.
Here, I'm dialing a phone number just using my hand.
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements,
but, interestingly,
is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand.
the book cover is matched
with so many thousands, or maybe millions of books online,
and checking out which book it is.
Once it has that information,
it finds out more reviews about that,
or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that,
so you can actually hear, on a physical book,
a review as sound.
Your newspaper will show you live weather information
rather than having it updated.
You have to check your computer in order to do that, right?
to check how much my flight has been delayed,
because at that particular time,
I'm not feeling like opening my iPhone,
and checking out a particular icon.
And I think this technology will not only change the way --
The fun part is, I'm going to the Boston metro,
of what you can think of
when this kind of technology merges with real life.
that all of our work is not only about physical objects.
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing
and all those kinds of things; what about that?
And many of you are excited about the next-generation tablet computers
to come out in the market.
I actually made my own, just using a piece of paper.
So, what I did here is remove the camera --
All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera.
I removed the microphone from that,
and then just pinched that --
like I just made a clip out of the microphone --
and clipped that to a piece of paper, any paper that you found around.
So now the sound of the touch
is getting me when exactly I'm touching the paper.
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving.
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54."
and playing a car-racing game.
or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper
wherever you need it.
So, more interestingly,
I'm interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way.
When I come back to my desk, I can just pinch that information
back to my desktop
so I can use my full-size computer.
Paper world is interesting to play with.
Here, I'm taking a part of a document,
and putting over here a second part from a second place,
So I now have a print-out of that thing.
So the workflow is more intuitive,
the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back,
rather than now switching between these two worlds.
the gap between these two worlds,
but will also help us, in some way,
to stay human,
to be more connected to our physical world.
And it will actually help us not end up being machines
sitting in front of other machines.
This is incredible, really.
What are you doing with this? Is there a company being planned?
Or is this research forever, or what?
thinking, "Why can we only have 'Sixth Sense'?
This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way
or hard to make your own.
How are you going to split your time going forward?
And now, if you see, it's more about the cost-effectiveness:
this system costs you $300
compared to the $20,000 surface tables, or anything like that.
So I'm excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses
rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment.
It's an honor to have you at TED.
Thank you so much.
That's fantastic.
I'd like to ask you,
what do these three people have in common?
Well, you probably recognize the first person.
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,
who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,
in the Poet of the Millions competition,
which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,
and seen throughout the Arab world.
In this contest
people have to write and recite
original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,
which is the traditional Bedouin form.
And Lima Sahar was a finalist
in the Afghan Star singing competition.
yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."
But my point in discussing this
is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you
how these merit-based competitions,
with equal access to everyone,
with the winner selected via voting by SMS,
are changing tribal societies.
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan
and the Arab world with the UAE,
how they're changing tribal societies,
not by introducing Western ideas,
but by being integrated into the language in those places.
Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."
We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.
We are running late.
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."
Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.
In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths
to be able to watch this program.
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.
People watch it all over the country
also in public places.
But it goes beyond watching,
because also, part of this
is campaigning.
People become so engaged
that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,
who fan out over the countryside,
campaigning for their candidate.
Contestants also put themselves forward.
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.
This has opened up the door,
particularly for women.
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.
One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,
a very conservative part of the country.
And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"
how her friends urged her not to do this
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.
But she also confides that
she knows that members of the Taliban
are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.
and put herself out, to compete
in the Poet of the Millions competition.
I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete
and were very much against it.
But, once she started to win,
then they got behind her again.
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.
And she's out there.
Her poetry is about women,
and the life of women in society.
So just by presenting herself
and being in competition with men --
this shows the voting on the program --
it sets a very important example for young women --
these are young women in the audience of the program --
in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.
would introduce a measure of Americanization.
But actually, just the opposite is happening.
By using this engaging popular format
for traditional, local culture,
it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival
of interest in Nabati poetry,
also in traditional dress and dance and music.
And for Afghanistan,
where the Taliban banned music for many years,
it is reintroducing their traditional music.
They don't sing pop songs,
they sing Afghan music.
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,
without avenging the winner.
(Laughter)
No small thing.
of this "American Idol" format,
which has just appeared in Afghanistan,
is a new program called "The Candidate."
And in this program, people present
policy platforms that are then voted on.
Many of them are too young to run for president,
but by putting the issues out there,
they are influencing the presidential race.
So for me, the substance of things unseen
is how reality TV is driving reality.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I started my journey 30 years ago.
And I worked in mines. And I realized that
this was a world unseen.
And I wanted, through color and large format cameras
and very large prints,
to make a body of work that somehow
became symbols of our
use of the landscape,
how we use the land.
And to me this was
a key component that somehow, through this medium of photography,
which allows us to contemplate these landscapes,
that I thought photography was perfectly suited
to doing this type of work.
it occurred to me that
oil is underpinning the scale and speed.
Because that is what has changed,
is the speed at which we're taking all our resources.
And so then I went out to develop a whole series
on the landscape of oil.
And what I want to do is to kind of map an arc
that there is extraction, where we're taking it from the ground,
refinement. And that's one chapter.
how we use it -- our cities,
our cars, our motorcultures,
where people gather around the vehicle
as a celebration.
And then the third one is this idea of the end of oil,
this entropic end,
where all of our parts of cars, our tires,
oil filters,
helicopters, planes --
where are the landscapes where all of that stuff ends up?
a way in which I could explore and research the world,
and find those places.
And another idea that I had as well,
that was brought forward by an ecologist --
he basically did a calculation where
he took one liter of gas and said,
well, how much carbon it would take, and how much organic material?
It was 23 metric tons for one liter.
So whenever I fill up my gas,
I think of that liter, and how much carbon.
but he did the calculations for our Earth
and what it had to do to produce that amount of energy.
From the photosynthetic growth,
it would take 500 years of that growth
to produce what we use, the 30 billion barrels we use per year.
this poses such a risk to our society.
Looking at 30 billion per year,
we look at our two largest suppliers,
Saudi Arabia and now Canada, with its dirty oil.
And together they only form about 15 years of supply.
The whole world, at 1.2 trillion estimated reserves,
only gives us about 45 years.
So, it's not a question of if, but a question of when
peak oil will come upon us.
and I feel that all of us need to now begin to really
take the task of using our talents,
our ways of thinking,
to begin to deal with what I think is probably
one of the most challenging issues of our time,
how to deal with our energy crisis.
30, 40 years from now, the children that I have,
I can look at them and say, "We did everything
we possibly, humanly could do,
to begin to mitigate this,
what I feel is one of the most important and critical
moments in our time. Thank you.
(Applause)
They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.
They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic,
that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.
to the assimilation of satellite data,
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes
calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.
It takes weeks to perform our integrations,
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia -- there are others.
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there
in the middle of the rainforest,
so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.
the forces can get up to two Gs;
the scientists must be completely harnessed in
in order to make measurements while on board.
and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.
A few years ago, my eyes were opened
to the dark side of the construction industry.
In 2006, young Qatari students
took me to go and see the migrant worker camps.
And since then I've followed the unfolding issue of worker rights.
in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled.
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings
is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker.
1.1 million of them.
Mainly Indian, Pakistani, Sri Lankan
and Nepalese, these laborers risk everything
to make money for their families back home.
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there.
And when they arrive, they find themselves in labor camps with no water,
no air conditioning, and their passports taken away.
99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector,
and so therefore we're equally, if not more, accountable.
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged,
but the numbers are simply overwhelming.
In August 2008,
UAE public officials noted
that 40 percent of the country's 1,098 labor camps
had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations.
And last summer, more than 10,000 workers
protested for the non-payment of wages,
for the poor quality of food, and inadequate housing.
When the contractors have gone bust,
as they've been overleveraged like everyone else,
the difference is everything goes missing,
documentation, passports,
and tickets home for these workers.
Currently, right now, thousands of workers are abandoned.
There is no way back home.
And there is no way, and no proof of arrival.
These are the boom-and-bust refugees.
as an architect, an engineer, as a developer,
if you know this is going on,
as we go to the sights every single week,
are you complacent or complicit
in the human rights violations?
So let's forget your environmental footprint.
Let's think about your ethical footprint.
What good is it
to build a zero-carbon, energy efficient complex,
when the labor producing this architectural gem
is unethical at best?
Now, recently I've been told I've been taking the high road.
But, quite frankly, on this issue,
there is no other road.
And that as we worry about our next job in the office,
the next design that we can get, to keep our workers.
Let's not forget these men, who are truly dying to work.
Thank you.
(Applause)
One of my favorite cartoon characters is Snoopy.
I love the way he sits and lies on his kennel and contemplates the great things of life.
So when I thought about compassion,
my mind immediately went to one of the cartoon strips,
where he's lying there and he says,
"I really understand, and I really appreciate
how one should love one's neighbor as one love's oneself.
The only trouble is the people next door; I can't stand them."
This, in a way, is one of the challenges
of how to interpret a really good idea.
If you look at all the world religions, all the main world religions,
you'll find within them some teaching concerning compassion.
So in Judaism, we have, from our Torah,
that you should love your neighbor as you love yourself.
And within Jewish teachings, the rabbinic teachings, we have Hillel,
who taught that you shouldn't do to others what you don't like being done to yourself.
And all the main religions have similar teachings.
And again, within Judaism,
we have a teaching about God,
who is called the compassionate one, Ha-rachaman.
After all, how could the world exist without God being compassionate?
And we, as taught within the Torah that we are made in the image of God,
so we too have to be compassionate.
But what does it mean? How does it impact on our everyday life?
Sometimes, of course, being compassionate
can produce feelings within us that are very difficult to control.
or when I have been sitting with the bereaved, or with people who are dying,
and I am overwhelmed by the sadness, by the difficulty,
the challenge that is there for the family, for the person.
And I'm touched, so that tears come to my eyes.
And yet, if I just allowed myself to be overwhelmed by these feelings,
I wouldn't be doing my job --
because I have to actually be there for them
and make sure that rituals happen, that practicalities are seen to.
And yet, on the other hand, if I didn't feel this compassion,
then I feel that it would be time for me to hang up my robe
and give up being a rabbi.
Who cannot be touched by compassion
when we see the terrible horrors of the results of war,
or famine, or earthquakes, or tsunamis?
I know some people who say
"Well, you know there's just so much out there -- I can't do anything,
I'm not going to even begin to try."
And there are some charity workers who call this compassion fatigue.
There are others who feel they can't confront compassion anymore,
and so they turn off the television and don't watch.
In Judaism, though, we tend to always say, there has to be a middle way.
but you have to be aware in such a way that you can carry on with your life
and be of help to people.
So part of compassion has to be an understanding of what makes people tick.
And, of course, you can't do that unless you understand yourself a bit more.
which says that when God created the world,
God thought that it would be best to create the world
only with the divine attribute of justice.
Because, after all, God is just.
Therefore, there should be justice throughout the world.
And then God looked to the future and realized,
if the world was created just with justice, the world couldn't exist.
And then God looked to the future and realized that,
in fact, if the world were just filled with compassion,
there would be anarchy and chaos.
There had to be limits to all things.
The rabbis describe this as being like a king
who has a beautiful, fragile glass bowl.
If you put too much cold water in, it will shatter.
If you put boiling water in, it will shatter.
What do you have to do? Put in a mixture of the two.
And so God put both of these possibilities into the world.
And that is the translation of the feelings
that we may have about compassion
into the wider world, into action.
So, like Snoopy, we can't just lie there
and think great thoughts about our neighbors.
We actually have to do something about it.
And so there is also, within Judaism, this notion of love and kindness
that becomes very important: "chesed."
The idea of justice, which gives boundaries to our lives
and gives us a feeling of what's right about life, what's right about living,
what should we be doing, social justice.
There has to be a willingness to do good deeds,
but not, of course, at the expense of our own sanity.
You know, there's no way that you can do anything for anyone
if you overdo things.
And balancing them all in the middle is this notion of compassion,
which has to be there, if you like, at our very roots.
because we're made in the image of God,
who is ultimately the compassionate one.
What does this compassion entail?
It entails understanding the pain of the other.
But even more than that,
it means understanding one's connection to the whole of creation:
understanding that one is part of that creation,
that there is a unity that underlies all that we see,
all that we hear, all that we feel.
I call that unity God.
And that unity is something that connects all of creation.
we're becoming even more aware of the connectivity of things,
that something I do here actually does matter in Africa,
that if I use too much of my carbon allowance,
it seems to be that we are causing
a great lack of rain in central and eastern Africa.
So there is a connectivity,
and I have to understand that -- as part of the creation,
as part of me being made in the image of God.
And I have to understand that my needs
sometimes have to be sublimated to other needs.
Because in Judaism, the number 18, in Hebrew letters,
stands for life -- the word "life."
So, in a sense, the 18 minutes is challenging me to say,
"In life, this is what's important in terms of compassion."
But, something else as well:
actually, 18 minutes is important.
Because at Passover, when we have to eat unleavened bread,
the rabbis say, what is the difference between dough that is made into bread,
and dough that is made into unleavened bread, or "matzah"?
And they say "It's 18 minutes."
Because that's how long they say it takes for this dough to become leaven.
What does it mean, "dough becomes leaven"?
It means it gets filled with hot air.
What's matzah? What's unleavened bread? You don't get it.
what we have to do is try to get rid of our hot air -- our pride,
our feeling that we are the most important people in the whole entire world,
and that everything should revolve round us.
So we try and get rid of those,
and so doing, try to get rid of the habits, the emotions, the ideas
that enslave us, that make our eyes closed, give us tunnel vision
so we don't see the needs of others --
and free ourselves and free ourselves from that.
And that too is a basis for having compassion,
for understanding our place in the world.
of a rich man who sat in synagogue one day.
And, as many people do, he was dozing off during the sermon.
And as he was dozing off, they were reading from the book of Leviticus in the Torah.
And they were saying that in the ancient times in the temple in Jerusalem,
the priests used to have bread,
which they used to place into a special table in the temple in Jerusalem.
The man was asleep, but he heard the words bread, temple, God, and he woke up.
He said, "God wants bread. That's it. God wants bread. I know what God wants."
took them to the synagogue, went into the synagogue,
opened the ark and said, "God, I don't know why you want this bread, but here you are."
And he put it in the ark with the scrolls of the Torah.
Then he went home.
"Oh God, I'm in such trouble. I've got children to feed.
My wife's ill. I've got no money. What can I do?"
He goes into the synagogue. "God, will you please help me?
Ah, what a wonderful smell."
He goes to the ark. He opens the ark.
"There's bread! God, you've answered my plea. You've answered my question."
Takes the bread and goes home.
"I'm an idiot. God wants bread?
God, the one who rules the entire universe, wants my bread?"
He rushes to the synagogue. "I'll get it out of the ark before anybody finds it."
He goes in there, and it's not there.
And he says, "God, you really did want it. You wanted my bread.
Next week, with raisins."
Every week, the man would bring bread with raisins,
with all sorts of good things, put it into the ark.
Every week, the cleaner would come. "God you've answered my plea again."
Take the bread. Take it home.
The rabbi came in and saw what was going on.
And he called the two of them to his office.
And he said, you know, "This is what's happening."
"You mean God didn't want my bread?"
You've misunderstood totally," he said.
"Of course, what you are doing," he said to the rich man,
"is answering God's plea that we should be compassionate.
And God," he said to the poor man, "is answering your plea
that people should be compassionate and give."
He looked at the rich man. He held the rich man's hands and said,
"Don't you understand?" He said, "These are the hands of God."
that I can only try to approach this notion of being compassionate,
of understanding that there is a connectivity, that there is a unity in this world;
that I want to try and serve that unity,
and that I can try and do that by understanding, I hope,
trying to understand something of the pain of others;
but understanding that there are limits, that people have to bear responsibility
for some of the problems that come upon them;
and that I have to understand that there are limits to my energy,
to the giving I can give.
I have to reevaluate them,
try and separate out the material things
and my emotions that may be enslaving me,
so that I can see the world clearly.
I can make these the hands of God.
And so try to bring compassion to life in this world.
I want to open by quoting Einstein's wonderful statement,
just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century
also agrees with us, and also calls us to this action.
He said, "A human being is a part of the whole, called by us, the 'universe,' --
a part limited in time and space.
He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings,
as something separated from the rest,
a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness.
This delusion is a kind of prison for us,
restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us.
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion,
to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty."
wherein compassion -- "karuna," it is called --
is defined as, "the sensitivity to another's suffering
and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering."
It pairs closely with love, which is the will for the other to be happy,
which requires, of course, that one feels some happiness oneself
and wishes to share it.
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness
and selfishness to compassion, the concern for others,
and, further, it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern
suffer helplessly, while the compassionate are more free
and, implicitly, more happy.
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair.
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering
as the most absolute, most terrible suffering anyone has ever had
and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others,
even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings.
In fact, suffering is so huge and enormous,
his own becomes less and less monumental.
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others.
And this immediately cheers him up,
as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion.
Thus, he uses his own suffering
as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion.
He is a very good colleague of Einstein's, we must say.
which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition,
of the great Saint Asanga
who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West
and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine.
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha's time.
And he was discontented with the state of people's practice
of the Buddhist religion in India at that time.
They're talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment,
but they are acting selfish and pathetic.
So, Buddha's teaching has lost its momentum.
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now,
but exists currently in a certain heaven" -- that's Maitreya --
"so, I'm going to go on a retreat and I'm going to meditate
and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me,
and gives me a teaching or something
to revive the practice of compassion in the world today."
and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya.
And he left in disgust.
And as he was leaving, he saw a man --
a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain.
And he had a lump of iron.
And he was rubbing it with a cloth.
And he became interested in that.
He said, "Well what are you doing?"
And the man said, "I'm making a needle."
And he said, "That's ridiculous. You can't make a needle
by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth."
And the man said, "Really?" And he showed him a dish full of needles.
So he said, "Okay, I get the point."
He went back to his cave. He meditated again.
This time, he comes down.
And as he's leaving, he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge.
And where it's landing to bring the twigs to the cliff,
its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock
six to eight inches in. There was a cleft in the rock
by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds.
So he said, "All right. I get the point." He went back.
Again, no vision of Maitreya after nine years.
And he again leaves, and this time: water dripping,
making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream.
And so, again, he goes back. And after 12 years there is still no vision.
And he's freaked out. And he won't even look left or right
to see any encouraging vision.
And there, in the town, he's approached by a dog
who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries,
even in America, I think, in some areas --
and he's looking just terrible.
And he becomes interested in this dog because it's so pathetic,
and it's trying to attract his attention. And he sits down looking at the dog.
And the dog's whole hindquarters are a complete open sore.
Some of it is like gangrenous,
and there are maggots in the flesh. And it's terrible.
He thinks, "What can I do to fix up this dog?
Well, at least I can clean this wound and wash it."
but then his awareness focuses on the maggots.
And he sees the maggots, and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute.
And they're maggoting happily in the dog's hindquarters there.
"Well, if I clean the dog, I'll kill the maggots. So how can that be?
That's it. I'm a useless person and there's no Buddha, no Maitreya,
and everything is all hopeless.
And now I'm going to kill the maggots?"
And he took a shard of something, and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh,
and he placed it on ground.
He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA.
He was just immediately caught with the situation.
So he thought, "I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh,
then clean the dog's wounds, and then
I'll figure out what to do with the maggots."
Apparently they wriggle around. They're kind of hard to grab, these maggots.
So he says, "Well, I'll put my tongue on the dog's flesh.
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue" --
the dog is kind of used up --
"and then I'll spit them one by one down on the thing."
So he goes down, and he's sticking his tongue out like this.
And he had to close his eyes, it's so disgusting, and the smell and everything.
He jumps back and there, of course, is the future Buddha Maitreya
in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights, golden, jeweled, a plasma body,
an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees.
And he says, "Oh." He bows.
But, being human, he's immediately thinking of his next complaint.
"My Lord, I'm so happy to see you, but where have you been for 12 years?
What is this?"
and making nests and dripping on rocks for you, mister dense?"
(Laughter)
"Looking for the Buddha in person," he said.
And he said, "You didn't have, until this moment, real compassion.
And, until you have real compassion, you cannot recognize love."
"Maitreya" means love, "the loving one," in Sanskrit.
And he said, "If you don't believe me, just take me with you."
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe, a ball --
took him on his shoulder.
And he ran into town in the marketplace, and he said, "Rejoice! Rejoice!
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions. Here he is."
And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him --
it wasn't Chautauqua, it was some other town --
because they saw a demented looking, scrawny looking yogi man,
like some kind of hippie, with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder,
shouting that the future Buddha had come.
But on the edge of town, one elderly lady, a charwoman in the charnel ground,
saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog,
but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya, and she offered a flower.
So that encouraged him, and he went with Maitreya.
which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds.
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years,
dictating to him five complicated tomes
of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion.
A famous one, it's called the "Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion."
And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one --
even animals too, but everyone is in human form.
The animals are in one of their human lives. The humans are human.
And then, among them, you think of your friends and loved ones, the circle at the table.
And you think of your enemies, and you think of the neutral ones.
And then you try to say, "Well, the loved ones I love.
But, you know, after all, they're nice to me.
I had fights with them. Sometimes they were unfriendly.
I got mad. Brothers can fight. Parents and children can fight.
So, in a way, I like them so much because they're nice to me.
While the neutral ones I don't know. They could all be just fine.
And then the enemies I don't like because they're mean to me.
But they are nice to somebody. I could be them."
we've all been each other's relatives, actually.
Therefore all of you, in the Buddhist view,
in some previous life, although you don't remember it and neither do I,
have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you.
And also, actually, I've been your mother.
I've been female, and I've been every single one of yours' mother in a previous life,
the way the Buddhists reflect.
So, my mother in this life is really great. But all of you in a way
are part of the eternal mother.
You gave me that expression; "the eternal mama," you said. That's wonderful.
So, that's the way the Buddhists do it.
A theist Christian can think that all beings, even my enemies, are God's children.
So, in that sense, we're related.
So, we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love --
just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don't know.
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the "I don't want to be compassionate to them"
to the ones we think of as the bad guys, the ones we hate and we don't like.
And we don't hate anyone, therefore. So we equalize. That's very important.
And that is, we think of every being as familiar, as family.
We expand. We take the feeling about remembering a mama,
and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation.
And we see the mother in every being.
We see that look that the mother has on her face,
looking at this child that is a miracle
that she has produced from her own body, being a mammal,
where she has true compassion, truly is the other, and identifies completely.
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life.
And that's why it's the most powerful form of altruism.
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings,
in spiritual traditions.
And so, we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings.
I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom,
when, of course, I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq.
I used to meditate on George Bush. He's quite a cute mom in a female form.
He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms.
And you think of him as nursing you.
And then Saddam Hussein's serious mustache is a problem,
but you think of him as a mom.
and you see how they could be familiar to you.
And you do that for a while, until you really feel that.
You can feel the familiarity of all beings.
Nobody seems alien. They're not "other."
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings.
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general,
if you can remember the kindness of your own mother,
if you can remember the kindness of your spouse,
or, if you are a mother yourself, how you were with your children.
And you begin to get very sentimental; you cultivate sentimentality intensely.
You will even weep, perhaps, with gratitude and kindness.
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility.
Every being, even the most mean looking ones, can be motherly.
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you.
And then the fourth step, you go to what is called "lovely love."
In each one of these you can take some weeks, or months, or days
depending on how you do it, or you can do them in a run, this meditation.
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy,
when they are satisfied.
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness.
Their face doesn't look like this. When they're angry, they look ugly, every being,
but when they're happy they look beautiful.
And so you see beings in their potential happiness.
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy, even the enemy.
when he says, "Love thine enemy."
He does say that, and we think he's being unrealistic
and sort of spiritual and highfalutin. "Nice for him to say it, but I can't do that."
But, actually, that's practical.
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy.
If your enemy was really happy, why would they bother to be your enemy?
How boring to run around chasing you.
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time.
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy,
because they'll stop being your enemy because that's too much trouble.
And then finally, the fifth step is compassion, "universal compassion."
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of.
And you look at them, and you see how they are.
And you realize how unhappy they are actually, mostly, most of the time.
You see that furrowed brow in people.
And then you realize they don't even have compassion on themselves.
They're driven by this duty and this obligation.
"I have to get that. I need more. I'm not worthy. And I should do something."
And they're rushing around all stressed out.
And they think of it as somehow macho, hard discipline on themselves.
But actually they are cruel to themselves.
And, of course, they are cruel and ruthless toward others.
And they, then, never get any positive feedback.
And the more they succeed and the more power they have,
the more unhappy they are.
And this is where you feel real compassion for them.
And the choice of the action, of course,
hopefully will be more practical
than poor Asanga, who was fixing the maggots on the dog
because he had that motivation, and whoever was in front of him,
he wanted to help.
But, of course, that is impractical. He should have founded the ASPCA in the town
and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots.
And I'm sure he did that later. (Laughter) But that just indicates the state of mind, you know.
is this thing where you're linked with the needs of others in a true way,
and you have compassion for yourself also,
and it isn't sentimental only. You might be in fear of something.
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy
being more and more mean to other people
and getting punished in the future for it in various ways.
And in Buddhism, they catch it in the future life.
Of course in theistic religion they're punished by God or whatever.
And materialism, they think they get out of it just by not existing,
by dying, but they don't.
And so they get reborn as whatever, you know.
But the next step is called "universal responsibility."
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion
must lead us to develop through true compassion,
what is called "universal responsibility."
In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama
that he always teaches everywhere, he says
that that is the common religion of humanity: kindness.
But "kindness" means "universal responsibility."
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us:
we are responsible for that, and we should take it
and do whatever we can at whatever little level
and small level that we can do it.
We absolutely must do that. There is no way not to do it.
where we live equally for ourselves and for others
and we are
joyful and happy.
One thing we mustn't think is that compassion makes you miserable.
Compassion makes you happy.
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself,
even if you haven't done anything yet for anybody else.
Although, the change in your mind already does something for other beings:
they can sense this new quality in yourself,
and it helps them already, and gives them an example.
and develop it within yourself.
Don't just think, "Well, I'm compassionate," or "I'm not compassionate,"
and sort of think you're stuck there.
You can develop this. You can diminish the non-compassion,
the cruelty, the callousness, the neglect of others,
and take universal responsibility for them.
And then, not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile,
but Karen Armstrong will smile.
from a secular perspective and even from a kind of scientific perspective.
I'm going to try to give you a little bit of a natural history
of compassion and the golden rule.
So, I'm going to be sometimes using kind of clinical language,
and so it's not going to sound as warm and fuzzy
as your average compassion talk.
I want to warn you about that.
The golden rule is great. I'm a big supporter of both.
And I think it's great that
the leaders of the religions of the world
are affirming compassion and the golden rule as fundamental principles
that are integral to their faiths.
I think nature gave them a helping hand here.
I'm going to argue tonight that compassion and the golden rule
are, in a certain sense, built into human nature.
But I'm also going to argue
that once you understand the sense in which they are built into human nature,
you realize that just affirming compassion,
and affirming the golden rule, is really not enough.
There's a lot of work to be done after that.
In the beginning, there was compassion,
I think it's probably the case that, in the human evolutionary lineage,
even before there were homo sapiens,
feelings like compassion and love and sympathy
had earned their way into the gene pool,
and biologists have a pretty clear idea of how this first happened.
And the basic idea of kin selection is that,
then, in the end, the compassion actually winds up helping the genes
underlying the compassion itself.
So, from a biologist's point of view, compassion is actually
a gene's way of helping itself. OK.
I'll get there -- I hope to get a little fuzzier.
is kind of self-serving at the genetic level.
Actually, I think the bad news about kin selection
is just that it means that this kind of compassion
is naturally deployed only within the family.
That's the bad news. The good news is compassion is natural.
The bad news is that this kin selected compassion
is naturally confined to the family.
a second kind of evolutionary logic.
Biologists call that "reciprocal altruism." OK.
And there, the basic idea is that
compassion leads you to do good things for people who then will return the favor.
Again, I know this is not as inspiring a notion of compassion
is ultimately self-serving too.
And so, you wind up most easily extending compassion to friends and allies.
you feel really bad.
you can probably live with that.
That's just human nature.
So, it's another good news/bad news story.
It's good that compassion was extended beyond the family
by this kind of evolutionary logic.
The bad news is this doesn't bring us universal compassion by itself.
So, there's still work to be done.
which I think is kind of good news,
it has given people an intuitive appreciation of the golden rule.
that has had no exposure to any of the great religious traditions,
and it's true because, although an appreciation of the golden rule is natural,
it's also natural to carve out exceptions to the golden rule.
Now, we have a rationale for that.
We say they did these bad things that make it just that they should go to prison.
put people in a special category.
that in everyday life, the way we all make these decisions
I'm much less inclined to apply the golden rule to you.
You see it in the Middle East:
people who, from Gaza, are firing missiles at Israel.
They wouldn't want to have missiles fired at them, but they say,
It's not going to save the world.
Are you on the edges of your seats here?
It's just a quick introduction to game theory.
If you ask what kind of a situation
is conducive to people becoming friends and allies,
the technical answer is a non-zero-sum situation.
And if you ask what kind of situation
is conducive to people defining people as enemies,
it's a zero-sum situation.
So, in tennis, every point is either good for you and bad for the other person,
because every point is either good for both of you -- positive, win-win --
or bad for both of you, it's lose-lose.
That's a non-zero-sum game.
And in real life, there are lots of non-zero-sum games.
In the realm of economics, say, if you buy something:
that means you'd rather have the merchandise than the money,
but the merchant would rather have the money than the merchandise.
You both feel you've won.
In a war, two allies are playing a non-zero-sum game.
And you could basically reformulate what I said earlier,
has naturally expanded these webs of non-zero-sumness,
these webs that can be these channels for compassion.
a lot of transportation and communication technologies --
has just inexorably made it so that more people
can be in more non-zero-sum relationships
with more and more people at greater and greater distances.
to the ancient state, the empire, and now here we are in a globalized world.
And the story of globalization is largely a story of non-zero-sumness.
applied to the modern world. Well, that's just another term for non-zero-sum.
If your fortunes are interdependent with somebody,
then you live in a non-zero-sum relationship with them.
And you see this all the time in the modern world.
bad for everybody, for much of the world.
Good things happen, and it's good for much of the world.
look at the depictions of Japanese
and you compare that to the attitude now,
I think part of that is due to a kind of economic interdependence.
And also, sometimes people don't recognize
And politicians can be aware, and should be aware that,
like, say, America, or any other nation --
human psychology is such that they use cues like:
Do we feel we're being respected?
Because, you know, historically, if you're not being respected,
you're probably not going to wind up in a non-zero-sum,
And some of this, again, is in the realm of political work.
of people in very different circumstances.
Well, the average American is going to resist
You know, they'll resist that comparison and that's natural, that's human.
when you try to humanize somebody in America who said that Islam is evil,
to a place it doesn't naturally go.
as far as compassion and the golden rule go,
by saying that it's good news that compassion and the golden rule
are in some sense built into human nature.
(Applause)
Come with me to 915 South Bloodworth Street
at the point when dinner is ready to be served.
Before we could eat, she would ask,
"Are all the children in?"
And if someone happened to be missing,
or whether someone had won the jabberwocky contest for talent --
that is, to make a fuss over the one who had been honored in some way.
For when one is honored, all are honored.
Mother Williamson who lived on Bledsoe Avenue,
and Mother Lathers who lived on Oberlin Road.
Why? Because they were old and infirm,
and we needed to go by to see if they needed anything.
Mom says, "If they ask you what it costs to either go shopping for them,
This was the nature of being at that table.
so we had to add God into it.
and then get ready for breakfast without even taking a bath or getting dressed,
And daddy brought Elder Revels to the Christmas family celebration.
We thought he must be out of his mind.
This is our time. This is intimate time.
Any other time, but not to the Christmas celebration.
It's time to make space, to share the enjoyment of life in a beloved community."
So, we sucked up.
(Laughter)
it was a sensibility to how we are together.
We are sisters and brothers united together.
And, like Chief Seattle said, "We did not spin the web of life.
We're all strands in it.
And whatever we do to the web, we do to ourselves."
Now that's compassion.
A harvested field of grain, with some grain in the corners,
reminding me of the Hebrew tradition
Talk about a picture of compassion.
a picture of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
walking arm in arm with Andy Young and Rabbi Heschel
Just a photograph.
Arm in arm for struggle.
Suffering together in a common hope that we can be brothers and sisters
without the accidents of our birth or our ethnicity
and I know that you would almost wish to have the opportunity
"You must love yourself,
and how their supporters in the congregation went the other way;
but an unsuspecting, despised person came along,
saw the man in need,
and a commitment to do whatever is necessary --
that all God's children would have their needs cared for,
so that we could answer when mommy eternal asks, "In regards to health,
where they started off, where they are going.
To be a pastor is to care for these individual needs.
and to be a good American -- for me,
Please pardon me, as a black man, for celebrating
that the election of Obama was an unusual sign
of the fact that it is a year of favor.
And yet, there is so much more that needs to be done.
And if mama eternal has taught us correctly,
this song will make sense, not only to those of us who are a part of this gathering,
but to all who sign the charter for compassion.
And this is why we do it.
♫ Receiving God's love and giving it away ♫
♫ When I looked up, heaven smiled at me ♫
♫ Sharing makes me happy, makes heaven happy too ♫
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,
and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of
as being one that is grounded in compassion.
The truth of the matter is otherwise.
and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,
the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"
or, as Sir Richard Burton --
not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,
but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that
and who was a worldwide traveler
and translator of many works of literature --
translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."
God says to his prophet Muhammad --
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,
beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,
including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --
that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,
except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."
whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet
is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --
in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"
or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --
therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,
activators of compassion, actors of compassion
and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.
but where do we go wrong,
and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?
For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.
In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,
or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.
And these doctors or these masters,
these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,
refer to teachings and examples of our prophet
that teach us where the source of our problems lies.
he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war
to the greater war, to the greater battle."
How can we go to a greater battle?"
The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,
and he knocks on the door,
and a voice answers, "Who's there?"
as we might say in English.
he comes back.
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.
"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"
-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos."
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"
and that is the "I" of divinity.
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition --
God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,
does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me
than what I have asked them to do."
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,
and if they've done that, then they can do extra.
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.
by doing more of what I've asked them to do" --
extra credit, we might call it --
"until I love him or love her.
And when I love my servant," God says,
"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,
the ears by which he or she listens,
the hand by which he or she grasps,
and the foot by which he or she walks,
and the heart by which he or she understands."
It is this merging of our self with divinity
that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.
the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"
and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"
it is because they became so much an instrument of God,
they became part of God's team --
so that God's will was manifest through them,
and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,
get our egotism out of the way.
have had what you might call a spiritual experience,
a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,
the boundaries of your ego dissolved.
And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --
one with that jug of water, one with every human being,
one with the Creator --
and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,
of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy
that you have ever experienced in your lives.
a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary
which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"
and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,
we say, "Oh, this is all you.
This is all you. And this is all us.
And us, and I, and us are all part of you.
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being
and the end of our journey,
you are also the breaker of our hearts.
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,
and for whose purpose we shall die,
and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again
to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."
and those of you who are here today,
and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,
because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.
We have access to it all.
Jung may have called it "the subconscious."
Through our subconscious, in your dreams --
the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"
"the temporary death" --
in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,
we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,
and we see wonderful things.
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,
and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator
whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.
whatever the name might be through which you name
or access the presence of divinity,
it is the locus of absolute being,
absolute love and mercy and compassion,
and absolute knowledge and wisdom,
what Hindus call "satchidananda."
The language differs,
but the objective is the same.
about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --
and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --
one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.
And they have a fight and an argument because
-- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." --
not knowing that the word that they're using
refers to the same reality in different languages.
one absolute being by definition,
because absolute is, by definition, single,
and absolute and singular.
There's this absolute concentration of being,
the absolute concentration of consciousness,
awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love
that defines the primary attributes of divinity.
the primary attributes of what it means to be human.
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,
is our physiology,
but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.
"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,
and breathed into him of my spirit,
then, fall in prostration to him."
The angels prostrate, not before the human body,
but before the human soul.
Why? Because the soul, the human soul,
embodies a piece of the divine breath,
a piece of the divine soul.
when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.
What is the imagery of God?
The imagery of God is absolute being,
absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom
and absolute compassion and love.
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,
in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --
means that we too have to be proper stewards
of the breath of divinity within us,
and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,
of being alive, of beingness;
the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.
and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,
and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,
and when we stand on this platform as such,
I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.
and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,
we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.
For he foretold of a period
when people shall transform their swords into plowshares
and will not learn war or make war anymore.
we must, we must lower our egos,
control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,
family ego, national ego --
and let all be for the glorification of the one.
(Applause)
It is helpless.
That implies the trusted person
won't violate the trust.
As the child grows,
that the person trusted is violating the trust.
a wordless blame,
so far, it has been a consumer,
but the growth of a human being
It's not that simple.
The self: you are self-aware.
Thank God we are empathetic.
When somebody's in pain, we pick up the pain.
these two guys fight it out.
Each one has got two games.
When he comes to the net,
nothing can touch it
because it is empathy.
you do something that makes a difference in somebody's life --
There's no Indian compassion.
There's no American compassion.
It transcends nation, the gender, the age.
it will never remain occasional.
By mandate, you cannot make a person compassionate.
Love is something you discover.
And the one who is happy,
known things and unknown things.
All of them are totally accepted
The subject -- "me" --
and the object -- the scheme of things --
You cannot be a part of wholeness
and still be whole.
I have no more reason to blame myself.
But if I say, in spite of my body being limited --
and power is therefore limited,
either you are or you are not. Period.
And the wholeness is the reality of you
when you relate to the world.
It is love first.
When you relate to the world,
the dynamic manifestation of the wholeness
You express yourself because you have compassion.
To discover the capacity to give and share,
you need to be giving and sharing.
There is no shortcut: it is like swimming by swimming.
You learn swimming by swimming.
You cannot learn swimming on a foam mattress and enter into water.
(Laughter)
You learn swimming by swimming. You learn cycling by cycling.
You learn cooking by cooking,
having some sympathetic people around you
to eat what you cook.
you have to fake it and make it.
You need to.
but you have an adverb for compassion.
But then, how to act compassionately if you don't have compassion?
That is where you fake.
You act compassionately as though you have compassion:
grind your teeth,
take all the support system.
Ask for compassion.
You'll discover compassion
and also slowly a relative compassion,
and slowly, perhaps if you get the right teaching,
and that's what you are.
(Applause)
One morning, in the year 1957,
the neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield
saw himself like this,
a weird freak with huge hands,
huge mouth,
and a tiny bottom.
Actually this creature
is the result of the Penfield research.
He named it homunculus.
Basically the homunculus is
the visualization of a human being
where each part of the body is proportional
to the surface it takes in the brain.
So, of course, homunculus is definitely not a freak.
It's you. It's me.
It's our invisible reality.
This visualization could explain, for example,
why newborns, or smokers,
put, instinctively, their fingers in the mouth.
Unfortunately it doesn't explain why
so many designers remain mainly interested
in designing chairs.
for my design I essentially refer to it.
I'm fascinated by its ability to
deeply investigate the human being,
its way of working, its way of feeling.
And it really helps me to understand
how we see, how we hear,
how we breathe, how our brain can inform or mislead us.
It's a great tool for me
to understand what could be our real needs.
Marketing reduces things. Marketing simplifies.
Marketing creates user groups.
And scientists, amidst complexity,
amidst fluctuation and uniqueness.
What could be our real needs?
Maybe the silence.
In our daily life we are continuously disturbed by
aggressive sounds.
And you know all those kind of sound puts us
in a kind of stressful state,
and prevent us from being quiet and focused.
So I wanted to create a kind of
sound filter,
able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution.
But I didn't want it to make it by
isolating people, without any earmuffs
or those kind of things.
Or neither with including complex technology.
I just wanted to, using the complexity
and the technology of the brain, of the human brain.
dB is basically --
dB is the name of the product,
basically a white noise diffuser.
This is white noise.
The white noise is the sum of all frequencies
that are audible by the human being,
brought to the same intensity.
And this noise is like a "shhhhhhhhhhhhh," like that.
And this noise is the most neutral.
It is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain.
So when you hear this sound
you feel like a kind of shelter,
preserved from noise pollution.
And when you hear the white noise, your brain is immediately focused on it.
And do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound.
It seems to be magic.
But it is just physiology. It's just in your brain.
And in mine, I hope.
a little bit active and reactive,
I create a ball, a rolling ball
able to analyze and find
where does aggressive sound come from,
and roll, at home or at work,
towards aggressive noise,
and emits white noise in order to neutralize it.
(Laughter)
It works.
You feel the effect of the white noise?
It's too in silence.
If you make some noise you can feel the effect.
even if this product includes some technology,
it includes some speakers, it includes some microphones
and some electronic devices,
this object is not a very smart object.
And I don't want to make a very smart object.
I don't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot.
I want to create an object like you and me.
So, definitely not perfect.
So imagine, for instance, you are at home.
A loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend.
You shout. You say, "Blah blah blah, Blah blah blah. Who is this guy?"
And dB will probably roll toward you.
And turning around you is "shhhhhhh," like that.
(Laughter)
Definitely not perfect. So you would probably
shut it, at this point.
(Laughter)
I designed K.
K is a daylight receiver transmitter.
So this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk,
or on your piano, where you are supposed
to spend most of your time in the day.
And this object will be
able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day,
and able to give you the quantity of light you need.
This object is completely covered by
fiber opticals.
And the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object, for sure,
but creates the idea of an
eye sensibility of the object.
I want, by this design
feel, when you see it,
you see, instinctively,
this object seems to be very sensitive,
very reactive.
And this object knows, better than you
and probably before you, what you really need.
You have to know that the lack of daylight
can provoke some
problem of energy, or problem of libido.
So, a huge problem.
(Laughter)
I live in collaboration with scientists.
I'm just a designer. So I need them.
So there can be some biologists,
psychiatrists, mathematicians, and so on.
And I submit them, my intuitions,
my hypothesis, my first ideas.
And they react. They told me what is possible, what is impossible.
And together we improve the original concept.
And we build the project to the end.
And this kind of relationship between designer and scientist
started when I was at school.
for a pharmaceutical industry.
And the irony for me was
of course, I didn't do that for the sake of science progress.
I just do that to make money.
Anyway, this project, or this experience,
make me start a new project on the design of medicine.
You have to know that today, roughly one or two every drug pills
is not taken correctly.
So even if the active constituents
in pharmaceuticals made constant progress
in terms of chemistry, target of stability,
the behavior of the patients
goes more and more unstable.
So we took too many of them.
We took irregular dosage.
We do not follow instructions. And so on.
new kind of medicine,
in order to create a new kind of relationship
between the patient and the treatment.
So I turned traditional pills into this.
I'm going to give you some example.
This one is an antibiotic.
And its purpose is to help patient
to go to the end of the treatment.
And the concept is to
create a kind of onion,
a kind of structure in layers.
So, you start with the darkest one.
And you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment.
And you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection.
So the first day, this is the big one.
And you have to peel and eat one layer a day.
And your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer.
And you're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the Christmas day.
And you follow the treatment like that,
to the end of the treatment.
And here you can get the white core.
And it means, right, you are in the recovery.
(Applause) Thank you.
a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment.
I designed it to help kids to follow the treatment.
So the idea of this one is to create
a relationship between the patient of the treatment
but a relationship of dependency.
But in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient.
This is, the kids will feel
the therapeutic object needs him.
So the idea is, all night long
the elastic skin of the third lung
will slowly inflate itself,
including air and molecules, for sure.
And when the kids wake up,
he can see the object needs him. And he take him to his mouth,
and breathe the air it contains.
So by this way,
the kid, to take care of himself,
is to take care of this living object.
And he does not feel anymore it's relies on asthma treatment,
as the asthma treatment needs him.
(Applause)
I like the idea of a kind of invisible design,
as if the function of the object
exists in a kind of invisible field
just around the objects themselves.
We could talk about a kind of soul,
of a ghost accompanying them.
And almost a kind of poltergeist effect.
So when a passive object like this one seems to be alive,
because it is -- woosh -- starting to move.
I made for John Maeda,
and for the Fondation Cartier in Paris.
And John Maeda was supposed to show
several graphic animations in this exhibition.
And my idea for this exhibition design was to create
a real pong game, like this one.
And the idea was to create some self-moving benches
in the main exhibition room.
So the living benches would be exactly like the ball.
And John was so excited by this idea. He said to me, "Okay let's go."
When I bring the 10 living and self-moving benches
in the exhibition room, John was just beside me,
and was like, "Hmm. Hmm."
And he told me, after a long silence,
"I wonder, Mathieu, if
people won't be more fascinated by your benches
than by my videos."
(Laughter)
It would be a great honor, a great compliment for me,
if he hadn't decided to take all them off
two hours before the opening.
So, huge tragedy.
that Pinocchio is one of my great influences.
Pinocchio is probably one of my best design products, my favorite one.
Because it is a kind of object with a conscience,
able to be modified by its surroundings,
and able to modify it as well.
The other great influence is the mine's canary.
In coal mines, this canary
was supposed to be close to the miners.
And it was singing all day long. And when it stops it means that it just died.
So this canary was a living alarm,
and a very efficient one.
A very natural technology,
in order to say to the miners,
"The air is too bad. You have to go. It's an emergency."
So it's, for me, a great product.
Andrea is one.
Andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses
from air, contaminated indoor air.
So it uses some plants to do this job,
selected for their gas-filtering ability.
You have to know, or you probably already know,
that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one.
So while I'm talking to you,
the seats you are sitting on are currently emitting some
invisible and odorless toxic gas. Sorry for that. (Laughter)
So you are currently breathing formaldehyde.
It's the same for me with the carpet.
And this is exactly the same at home.
Because all the product we get constantly give away
the volatile component of which they're made of.
So your sofa, your plastic chair,
your kid's toys
give their own invisible reality. And this one is very toxic.
This is the reason why
I created, with David Edward,
a scientist of Harvard University,
an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants.
But the idea is to force
the air to go in the effective part of the plants.
Because the roots of the plant are not very effective.
Bill Wolverton from NASA
analyzed it cleverly in the '70s.
So the idea is to create an object
able to force the air, and to be in contact at the right speed
at the right place, in all the effective parts of the plant.
So this is the final object.
It will be launched next September.
(Applause)
because I include, in a product
like Andrea, some plants.
And in this one, plants are used for the water filtration ability.
And it includes some fishes as well.
But here, unlike Andrea,
here are supposed to be eaten.
Indeed, this object is a domestic farm,
for fishes and green.
So the idea of this object
is to be able to get at home
very local food.
The locavores
used to get food
taken in a radius of 100 miles.
Local River is able to provide you
food directly in your living room.
So the principle of this object
is to create an ecosystem
called aquaponics.
And the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish,
by a water pump, feeds the plants above.
And the plants will filter, by the roots,
the dirty water of the fish.
After, it goes back into the fish tank.
Or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your TV set.
Amazing channel.
Or you start fishing.
And you make some sushis with a fish
and the aromatic plants above.
Because you can grow some potatoes.
No, not potatoes, but tomatoes,
aromatic plants and so on.
Now we can eat local food.
Now we can be treated by smart medicine.
Now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm
with daylight.
But it was important to create a perfect place,
so I tried to,
in order to work and create.
So I designed, for an American scientist based in Paris,
a very stimulative, brain-stimulative office.
I wanted to create a perfect place
where you can work and play,
and where your body and your brain can work together.
you do not work anymore at your desk, like a politician.
Your seat, your sleep and your play
on a big geodesic island made of leather.
See, like this one?
In this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper,
but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave,
like a prehistoric scientist.
So you, like that, can make some sport during your work.
In this office
you do not need to go out
in order to be in contact with nature.
You include, directly, the nature in the floor of the office.
You can see it there.
to lead this project of the office.
It really helped me to design it.
I never show it to my client. He would be so afraid.
(Laughter)
Just for my workshop.
I guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig I was.
as monkey and homunculus we are.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Hello, everyone. Because this is my first time at TED,
I've decided to bring along an old friend
to help break the ice a bit.
Yes. That's right. This is Barbie.
She's 50 years old. And she's looking as young as ever.
(Laughter)
But I'd also like to introduce you to
what may be an unfamiliar face.
This is Fulla. Fulla is the Arab world's answer to Barbie.
Barbie and Fulla occupy these completely separate spheres.
They have different interests. They have divergent values.
And should they ever come in contact ...
well, I've got to tell you, it's just not going to be pretty.
Where I work, in the Arab region,
people are busy taking up Western innovations
and changing them into things
which are neither conventionally Western,
nor are they traditionally Islamic.
I want to show you two examples.
The first is 4Shbab.
It means "for youth" and it's a new Arab TV channel.
The USA.
♫ She was adorned by the light of the Quran ♫
Its creator, who is an Egyptian TV producer
called Ahmed Abu Haïba,
wants young people to be inspired
by Islam to lead better lives.
He reckons the best way to get that message across
is to use the enormously popular medium of music videos.
4Shbab was set up as an alternative
to existing Arab music channels.
And they look something like this.
(Music)
and pan-Arab pin-up girl.
In the world of 4Shbab, it's not about bump and grind.
But it's not about fire and brimstone either.
Its videos are intended to show
a kinder, gentler face of Islam,
for young people to deal with life's challenges.
And it's called "The 99."
Now, these are the world's first Islamic superheroes.
They were created by a Kuwaiti psychologist
called Naif Al Mutawa.
And his desire is to rescue Islam
from images of intolerance,
all in a child-friendly format.
"The 99." The characters are meant to embody
the 99 attributes of Allah:
justice, wisdom, mercy, among others.
So, for example, there is the character of Noora.
She is meant to have the power
to look inside people
and see the good and bad in everyone.
Another character called Jami
has the ability to create fantastic inventions.
It's now a theme park.
There is an animated series in the works.
And by this time next year,
the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman
will have joined forces with "The 99"
to beat injustice wherever they find it.
of this sort of Islamic cross-cultural hybridization.
We're not talking here about a clash of civilizations.
Nor is it some sort of indistinguishable mash.
I like to think of it as a mesh of civilizations,
in which the strands of different cultures are intertwined.
there is actually a very long tradition of this.
Throughout its history, Islam has borrowed and adapted from other civilizations
both ancient and modern.
After all, it's the Quran which encourages us to do this:
"We made you into nations and tribes
so that you could learn from one another."
And to my mind, those are pretty wise words,
no matter what your creed. Thank you.
(Applause)
On the 30th of May, 1832,
a gunshot was heard
ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in Paris.
(Gunshot)
A peasant, who was walking to market that morning,
ran towards where the gunshot had come from,
The young man's name was Evariste Galois.
He was a well-known revolutionary in Paris at the time.
Galois was taken to the local hospital
where he died the next day in the arms of his brother.
And the last words he said to his brother were,
"Don't cry for me, Alfred.
I need all the courage I can muster
to die at the age of 20."
for which Galois was famous.
But a few years earlier, while still at school,
he'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical
problems at the time.
And he wrote to the academicians in Paris,
trying to explain his theory.
But the academicians couldn't understand anything that he wrote.
(Laughter)
this possibly is his last chance
to try and explain his great breakthrough.
So he stayed up the whole night, writing away,
trying to explain his ideas.
And as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny,
he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation.
Maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics
was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed.
was a new language, a language to understand
one of the most fundamental concepts
of science -- namely symmetry.
Now, symmetry is almost nature's language.
It helps us to understand so many
different bits of the scientific world.
For example, molecular structure.
What crystals are possible,
because they are generally rather nasty.
The swine flu virus, at the moment, is a symmetrical object.
And it uses the efficiency of symmetry
But on a larger scale of biology, actually symmetry is very important,
because it actually communicates genetic information.
And if I ask you which of these you find more beautiful,
you're probably drawn to the lower two.
that you've got good genes, you've got a good upbringing
and therefore you'll make a good mate.
So symmetry is a language which can help to communicate
genetic information.
what's happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
Or what's not happening in the Large Hadron Collider in CERN.
To be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles
we might see there,
it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape
in a higher dimensional space.
the power of mathematics
to understand the scientific world around us.
He wrote, "The universe cannot be read
until we have learnt the language
and become familiar with the characters in which it is written.
It is written in mathematical language,
and the letters are triangles, circles and other geometric figures,
without which means it is humanly impossible
to comprehend a single word."
Artists too love to play around with symmetry.
They also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it.
Here is Thomas Mann talking about symmetry in "The Magic Mountain."
He has a character describing the snowflake,
and he says he "shuddered at its perfect precision,
of symmetry and then break them.
And a beautiful example of this
I found, actually, when I visited a colleague of mine
in Japan, Professor Kurokawa.
And he took me up to the temples in Nikko.
And just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs.
And the gateway you see behind
has eight columns, with beautiful symmetrical designs on them.
Seven of them are exactly the same,
and the eighth one is turned upside down.
to be cast out on a desert island, to live the rest of my life,
being an addict of symmetry, I would probably choose the Alhambra in Granada.
This is a palace celebrating symmetry.
Recently I took my family --
the reflective symmetry in the water.
But it's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening.
The Moorish artists were denied the possibility
to draw things with souls.
So they explored a more geometric art.
And so what is symmetry?
The Alhambra somehow asks all of these questions.
What is symmetry? When [there] are two of these walls,
do they have the same symmetries?
Can we say whether they discovered
all of the symmetries in the Alhambra?
to be able to answer some of these questions.
For Galois, symmetry -- unlike for Thomas Mann,
which was something still and deathly --
for Galois, symmetry was all about motion.
What can you do to a symmetrical object,
move it in some way, so it looks the same
as before you moved it?
I like to describe it as the magic trick moves.
I can take all of these tiles, and fix them at the yellow place,
rotate them by 90 degrees,
put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there.
And if you open your eyes again, you wouldn't know that they'd moved.
But it's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry
so brace yourselves --
push you a little bit to understand how this language works,
Let's take the twisted six-pointed starfish.
What can I do to the starfish which makes it look the same?
Well, there I rotated it by a sixth of a turn,
and still it looks like it did before I started.
I could rotate it by a third of a turn,
or a half a turn,
or put it back down on its image, or two thirds of a turn.
And a fifth symmetry, I can rotate it by five sixths of a turn.
And those are things that I can do to the symmetrical object
that make it look like it did before I started.
Can anybody think what else I could do to this
It's got no reflective symmetry.
But what I could do is just leave it where it is,
pick it up, and put it down again.
And for Galois this was like the zeroth symmetry.
It seems mad to talk about nothing.
And this is the same idea. This is a symmetrical --
And what about the triangle?
Well, I can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise
or a third of a turn anticlockwise.
But now this has some reflectional symmetry.
I can reflect it in the line through X,
or the line through Y,
or the line through Z.
Five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry
where I just pick it up and leave it where it is.
So both of these objects have six symmetries.
Now, I'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport,
and you have to do some mathematics
in order to really understand it.
And I'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk
for the person who gets closest to the answer.
The Rubik's Cube.
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
How many things can I do to this object
and put it down so it still looks like a cube?
What Galois realized: it isn't just the individual symmetries,
but how they interact with each other
which really characterizes the symmetry of an object.
If I do one magic trick move followed by another,
For example, what if I turn the starfish
by a sixth of a turn,
and then a third of a turn?
are the names for the rotations.
B, for example, rotates the little yellow dot
followed by C, which is a third of a turn?
Well let's do that. A sixth of a turn,
followed by a third of a turn,
the combined effect is as if I had just rotated it by half a turn in one go.
So the little table here records
how the algebra of these symmetries work.
I do one followed by another, the answer is
it's rotation D, half a turn.
What I if I did it in the other order? Would it make any difference?
Let's see. Let's do the third of the turn first, and then the sixth of a turn.
Of course, it doesn't make any difference.
It still ends up at half a turn.
with the triangle, one after the other.
Let's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise,
and reflect in the line through X.
Well, the combined effect is as if I had just done the reflection in the line through Z
to start with.
Now, let's do it in a different order.
Let's do the reflection in X first,
followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise.
The combined effect, the triangle ends up somewhere completely different.
It's as if it was reflected in the line through Y.
And this enables us to distinguish
they have the same symmetries?
But the way the symmetries interact
enable us -- we've now got a language
to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different.
And you can try this when you go down to the pub, later on.
Take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn,
then flip it. And then do it in the other order,
and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction.
It's almost like little Sudoku tables.
You don't see any symmetry twice
in any row or column.
And, using those rules, he was able to say
that there are in fact only two objects
with six symmetries.
And they'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle,
or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish.
I think this is an amazing development.
It's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry.
In the front here, I've got one, two, three people
sitting on one, two, three chairs.
The people and the chairs are very different,
but the number, the abstract idea of the number, is the same.
Here are two very different walls,
very different geometric pictures.
But, using the language of Galois,
we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things
are actually the same.
For example, let's take this beautiful wall
with the triangles with a little twist on them.
You can rotate them by a sixth of a turn
around the point where all the triangles meet.
And all the tiles match up again.
So rotate along halfway along the edge, and they all match up.
And we find the same symmetries here, and the same interaction.
So, there was a sixth of a turn. A third of a turn where the Z pieces meet.
And the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars.
And although these walls look very different,
Galois has produced a language to say
that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same.
And it's a symmetry we call 6-3-2.
This is a wall, a ceiling, and a floor.
They all look very different. But this language allows us to say
that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object,
by a quarter of a turn, and one by half a turn.
because Galois can say,
"Did the Moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries
on the walls in the Alhambra?"
And it turns out they almost did.
And they, if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one,
And the power of Galois' mathematical language
is it also allows us to create
symmetrical objects in the unseen world,
beyond the two-dimensional, three-dimensional,
all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space.
And that's where I work. I create
mathematical objects, symmetrical objects,
using Galois' language,
in very high dimensional spaces.
So I think it's a great example of things unseen,
which the power of mathematical language allows you to create.
creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you,
and I've got a picture of it here.
Well, unfortunately it isn't really a picture. If I could have my board
at the side here, great, excellent.
Here we are. Unfortunately, I can't show you
a picture of this symmetrical object.
But here is the language which describes
how the symmetries interact.
does not have a name yet.
Now, people like getting their names on things,
on craters on the moon
or new species of animals.
So I'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object
which hasn't been named before.
And this thing -- species die away,
and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode --
but this mathematical object will live forever.
It will make you immortal.
In order to win this symmetrical object,
what you have to do is to answer the question I asked you at the beginning.
How many symmetries does a Rubik's Cube have?
Rather than you all shouting out, I want you to count how many digits there are
in that number. Okay?
If you've got it as a factorial, you've got to expand the factorials.
Okay, now if you want to play,
I want you to stand up, okay?
because you've underestimated.
Five or less digits. So, if you're in the tens of thousands you've got to sit down.
You've overestimated.
20 digits or less, sit down.
Two? So you should have sat down earlier.
(Laughter)
Let's have the other ones, who sat down during the 20, up again. Okay?
If I told you 20 or less, stand up.
21. Okay good. How many do you have in yours?
18. So it goes to this lady here.
21 is the closest.
It actually has -- the number of symmetries in the Rubik's cube
has 25 digits.
So now I need to name this object.
So, what is your name?
I need your surname. Symmetrical objects generally --
spell it for me.
G-H-E-Z
So Ghez, there we go. That's your new symmetrical object.
You are now immortal.
I have a project raising money for a charity in Guatemala,
where I will stay up all night and devise an object for you,
for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in Guatemala.
And I think what drives me, as a mathematician,
are those things which are not seen, the things that we haven't discovered.
I'm a writer and a journalist,
and I'm also an insanely curious person,
so in 22 years as a journalist,
I've learned how to do a lot of new things.
And three years ago, one of the things I learned how to do
was to become invisible.
I became one of the working homeless.
I quit my job as a newspaper editor
after my father died in February of that same year,
and decided to travel.
His death hit me pretty hard.
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that.
that living in a van for a year to do this
would be like one long camping trip.
So I packed my cat, my Rottweiler
and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van,
and drove off into the sunset,
having fully failed to realize three critical things.
One: that society equates
living in a permanent structure, even a shack,
with having value as a person.
Two: I failed to realize how quickly
the negative perceptions of other people
can impact our reality, if we let it.
Three: I failed to realize
that homelessness is an attitude,
not a lifestyle.
I showered in campgrounds. I ate out regularly.
And I had time to relax and to grieve.
But then the anger and the depression about my father's death set in.
My freelance job ended. And I had to get a full-time job
to pay the bills.
What had been a really mild spring
turned into a miserably hot summer.
And it became impossible to park anywhere --
(Laughs)
-- without being very obvious
that I had a cat and a dog with me, and it was really hot.
The cat came and went through an open window in the van.
The doggy went into doggy day care.
And I sweated.
Whenever I could, I used
employee showers in office buildings and truck stops.
Or I washed up in public rest rooms.
making it difficult or impossible to sleep.
Food rotted in the heat.
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours,
and it was pretty miserable.
I couldn't afford to find an apartment,
or couldn't afford an apartment that would allow me
to have the Rottweiler and the cat.
And I refused to give them up,
so I stayed in the van.
And when the heat made me too sick
to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom
outside my van at night,
I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet.
below freezing. And they stayed there.
And I faced a whole new set of challenges.
I parked a different place every night
so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police.
I didn't always succeed.
And I don't know when or how it happened,
but the speed at which I went
from being a talented writer and journalist
to being a homeless woman, living in a van,
took my breath away.
I hadn't changed. My I.Q. hadn't dropped.
My talent, my integrity, my values,
everything about me remained the same.
But I had changed somehow.
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression.
And I went. I hadn't bathed in three days.
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line.
I just wasn't drunk or high.
And when several of the homeless men realized that,
including a former university professor,
they said, "You aren't homeless. Why are you really here?"
Other homeless people didn't see me as homeless,
but I did.
Then the professor listened to my story and he said,
"You have a job. You have hope.
The real homeless don't have hope."
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression
left me suicidal. And I remember thinking,
"If I killed myself, no one would notice."
that she had heard that Tim Russert,
a nationally renowned journalist,
had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I'd written about my father,
the year before he died, was in Tim's new book.
And he was doing the talk show circuit. And he was talking about my writing.
And when I realized that Tim Russert, former moderator of "Meet the Press,"
was talking about my writing,
while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
I started laughing.
You should too.
(Laughter)
because it got to the point where,
was I a writer, or was I a homeless woman?
So I went in the bookstore. And I found Tim's book.
And I stood there. And I reread my essay.
And I cried.
Because I was a writer.
I was a writer.
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee.
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends.
And I started writing again.
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist.
I was winning awards. I was living in my own apartment.
I was no longer homeless.
And I was no longer invisible.
and live in their cars.
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize
living in your vehicle or on the streets.
So the homeless, the working homeless, primarily remain invisible.
But if you ever meet one,
engage them, encourage them, and offer them hope.
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope.
And I'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless.
I'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet.
But I am here to tell you that, based on my experience,
people are not where they live,
where they sleep,
or what their life situation is at any given time.
Three years ago I was living in a van
in a Wal-Mart parking lot,
and today I'm speaking at TED.
Hope always, always finds a way. Thank you.
(Applause)
All buildings today have something in common.
They're made using Victorian technologies.
This involves blueprints,
industrial manufacturing
and construction using teams of workers.
All of this effort results in an inert object.
And that means that there is a one-way transfer of energy
from our environment into our homes and cities.
This is not sustainable.
I believe that the only way that it is possible for us
to construct genuinely sustainable homes and cities
is by connecting them to nature,
not insulating them from it.
Living systems are in constant conversation
with the natural world,
through sets of chemical reactions called metabolism.
And this is the conversion of one group of substances
into another, either through
the production or the absorption of energy.
And this is the way in which living materials
make the most of their local resources
in a sustainable way.
So, I'm interested in the use of
metabolic materials for the practice of architecture.
But they don't exist. So I'm having to make them.
at the Bartlett School of Architecture,
and we're collaborating with international scientists
in order to generate these new materials
from a bottom up approach.
That means we're generating them from scratch.
One of our collaborators is chemist Martin Hanczyc,
and he's really interested in the transition from
inert to living matter.
Now, that's exactly the kind of process that I'm interested in,
when we're thinking about sustainable materials.
Now all this is -- and it's magic --
is a little fatty bag. And it's got a chemical battery in it.
And it has no DNA.
This little bag is able to conduct itself
in a way that can only be described as living.
It is able to move around its environment.
It can follow chemical gradients.
It can undergo complex reactions,
some of which are happily architectural.
So here we are. These are protocells,
patterning their environment.
We don't know how they do that yet.
Here, this is a protocell, and it's vigorously shedding this skin.
Now, this looks like a chemical kind of birth.
This is a violent process.
out of the atmosphere
and turn it into carbonate.
And that's the shell around that globular fat.
They are quite brittle. So you've only got a part of one there.
So what we're trying to do is, we're trying to push these technologies
towards creating bottom-up construction approaches
for architecture,
which contrast the current, Victorian, top-down methods
which impose structure upon matter.
That can't be energetically sensible.
actually exist today.
They've been in use, in architecture, since ancient times.
If you walk around the city of Oxford, where we are today,
and have a look at the brickwork,
which I've enjoyed doing in the last couple of days,
you'll actually see that a lot of it is made of limestone.
And if you look even closer,
you'll see, in that limestone, there are little shells
and little skeletons that are piled upon each other.
And then they are fossilized over millions of years.
isn't particularly that interesting.
It looks beautiful.
But imagine what the properties of this limestone block might be
if the surfaces were actually
in conversation with the atmosphere.
Maybe they could extract carbon dioxide.
Would it give this block of limestone new properties?
Well, most likely it would. It might be able to grow.
It might be able to self-repair, and even respond
to dramatic changes
in the immediate environment.
with just one block of an interesting material.
They think big. Okay?
So when we think about scaling up metabolic materials,
we can start thinking about ecological interventions
like repair of atolls,
or reclamation of parts of a city
that are damaged by water.
So, one of these examples
would of course be the historic city of Venice.
Now, Venice, as you know, has a tempestuous relationship with the sea,
and is built upon wooden piles.
So we've devised a way by which it may be possible
for the protocell technology that we're working with
to sustainably reclaim Venice.
And architect Christian Kerrigan
has come up with a series of designs that show us
how it may be possible to actually grow a limestone reef
underneath the city.
This is our protocell technology,
effectively making a shell, like its limestone forefathers,
and depositing it in a very complex environment,
against natural materials.
We're looking at crystal lattices to see the bonding process in this.
Now, this is the very interesting part.
We don't just want limestone dumped everywhere in all the pretty canals.
What we need it to do is to be
creatively crafted around the wooden piles.
moving away from the light,
toward the dark foundations.
We've observed this in the laboratory.
The protocells can actually move away from the light.
They can actually also move towards the light. You have to just choose your species.
So that these don't just exist as one entity,
we kind of chemically engineer them.
And so here the protocells are depositing their limestone
very specifically, around the foundations of Venice,
effectively petrifying it.
It's going to take years of tuning and monitoring this technology
in order for us to become ready
to test it out in a case-by-case basis
on the most damaged and stressed buildings within the city of Venice.
But gradually, as the buildings are repaired,
we will see the accretion of a limestone reef beneath the city.
An accretion itself is a huge sink of carbon dioxide.
Also it will attract the local marine ecology,
who will find their own ecological niches within this architecture.
that connects a city to the natural world
in a very direct and immediate way.
But perhaps the most exciting thing about it
is that the driver of this technology is available everywhere.
This is terrestrial chemistry. We've all got it,
which means that this technology is just as appropriate
for developing countries as it is
for First World countries.
So, in summary, I'm generating metabolic materials
as a counterpoise to Victorian technologies,
and building architectures from a bottom-up approach.
have some of the properties of living systems,
which means they can perform in similar ways.
They can expect to have a lot of forms and functions
within the practice of architecture.
And finally, an observer in the future
marveling at a beautiful structure in the environment
may find it almost impossible to tell
whether this structure
has been created by a natural process
or an artificial one.
Thank you.
(Applause)
and even before,
wondering, therefore,
and how they could rest when they were tired
be warmer, cooler, safer,
in less pain.
how to draw better.
they wished for progress, just as we do.
But they failed, almost completely, to make any.
They didn't know how to.
the world never improved.
And within 40 years,
physicists discovered the whole explanation,
But never mind the symbols.
Nuclei and nuclear reactions, of course.
neutrinos,
the conversion of mass to energy -- that's E=mc2 --
That ancient dream that had always eluded the alchemists
was achieved through these same theories
and new, unexpected phenomena.
about stars and all those other urgent problems they had.
that dominated their lives,
isn't sufficiently recognized, I think.
But that ability to make progress
remained almost unused,
and of how to adapt it to our wishes
has been growing relentlessly.
Now, what had changed?
What were people now doing for the first time
How to make that difference
is surely the most important universal truth
And worryingly, there's no consensus about what it is.
So, I'll tell you.
they believed that everything important, knowable,
was already known,
enshrined in ancient writings, institutions
and in some genuinely useful rules of thumb --
which were, however, entrenched as dogmas,
that actually knew very little.
But that can't be what made the difference.
was a radical idea about things unseen,
known as empiricism --
Well, we've seen that that can't be true.
And the unseen, you have to admit,
doesn't come to us through the senses.
We don't see those nuclear reactions in stars.
and other universes.
But it doesn't.
It was a photograph -- not of space-time,
but of an eclipse, with a dot there rather than there.
And the evidence for evolution?
Some rocks and some finches.
What we see in all these cases
"So you admit it's all interpretation.
No one's ever seen evolution.
We see rocks.
You have your interpretation. We have ours.
But what creationist and empiricists both ignore
is that, in that sense,
no one's ever seen a Bible either,
Brains only detect nerve impulses.
It's always, as Karl Popper put it,
Scientific knowledge isn't derived from anything.
tested by observation,
So, were testable conjectures the great innovation
that opened the intellectual prison gates?
in myths and all sorts of other irrational modes of thinking.
Any crank claiming the sun will go out next Tuesday
has got a testable prediction.
And each year,
she is magically compelled to return.
And her mother, Demeter,
goddess of the earth,
That myth is testable.
If winter is caused by Demeter's sadness,
then it must happen everywhere on earth simultaneously.
and with all prescientific thinking?
the Enlightenment and everything.
And here's the crucial thing:
there is such a thing as a defect in a story.
that accounts for what's seen;
could be played equally well
Here's one: Persephone wasn't released.
with her spring powers.
She cools his domain with spring air,
venting heat up to the surface, creating summer.
That accounts for the same phenomena as the original myth.
And that's possible
because, without a functional reason
advocating one of them in preference to the others
is that the Earth's axis is tilted like that,
so each hemisphere tilts towards the sun for half the year,
because every detail plays a functional role.
For instance, we know, independently of seasons,
and that a spinning sphere, in space,
And the tilt also explains
the sun's angle of elevation at different times of year,
If they'd been observed in phase,
the theory would have been refuted.
For instance, when Demeter's upset,
So, being proved wrong by observation
So, in science, two false approaches blight progress.
One's well-known: untestable theories.
But the more important one is explanationless theories.
Whenever you're told that some existing statistical trend will continue
you're being told a wizard did it.
because they share half our genes,
When someone announces that the nature-nurture debate
but they don't explain how genes cause opinions,
The future, as we know it, is very unpredictable.
The best minds in the best institutions
generally get it wrong.
This is in technology. This is in the area of politics,
where pundits, the CIA, MI6 always get it wrong.
And it's clearly in the area of finance.
With institutions established to think about the future,
the IMF, the BIS, the Financial Stability Forum, couldn't see what was coming.
Over 20,000 economists
whose job it is, competitive entry to get there,
couldn't see what was happening.
And this change is getting more rapid.
The future will be more unpredictable.
Urbanization, integration,
coming together, leads to a new renaissance.
It did this a thousand years ago.
The last 40 years have been extraordinary times.
Life expectancy has gone up by about 25 years.
It took from the Stone Age to achieve that.
Income has gone up for a majority of the world's population,
despite the population going up by about two billion people over this period.
And illiteracy has gone down, from a half to about a quarter of the people on Earth.
A huge opportunity, unleashing of new potential
for innovation, for development.
There are two Achilles' heels of globalization.
There is the Achilles' heel of growing inequality --
those that are left out, those that feel angry,
those that are not participating. Globalization
has not been inclusive.
The second Achilles' heel is complexity --
a growing fragility, a growing brittleness.
What happens in one place very quickly affects everything else.
This is a systemic risk, systemic shock.
We've seen it in the financial crisis. We've seen it in the pandemic flu.
It will become virulent and it's something we have to build resilience against.
There have been huge leaps. There will be a million-fold improvement
in what you can get for the same price
in computing by 2030.
That's what the experience of the last 20 years has been.
It will continue.
Our computers, our systems will be as primitive
as the Apollo's are for today.
Our mobile phones are more powerful than the total Apollo space engine.
Our mobile phones are more powerful than
some of the strongest computers of 20 years ago.
So what will this do?
It will create huge opportunities in technology.
Miniaturization as well.
There will be invisible capacity. Invisible capacity in our bodies,
in our brains, and in the air.
This is a dust mite on a nanoreplica.
not least in the area of medicine.
This is a stem cell that we've developed here in Oxford,
from an embryonic stem cell.
We can develop any part of the body.
Increasingly, over time, this will be possible from our own skin --
able to replicate parts of the body.
Fantastic potential for regenerative medicine.
I don't think there will be a Special Olympics long after 2030,
because of this capacity to regenerate parts of the body.
But the question is, "Who will have it?"
in the area of what can happen in genetics.
The capacity to create, as this mouse has been genetically modified,
something which goes three times faster,
lasts for three times longer, we could produce,
as this mouse can, to the age of our equivalent of 80 years,
using about the same amount of food.
But will this only be available for the super rich,
for those that can afford it? Are we headed for a new eugenics?
Will only those that are able to afford it
be able to be this super race of the future?
(Laughter)
"How do we manage this technological change?"
How do we ensure that it creates
a more inclusive technology,
a technology which means
that not only as we grow older,
that we can also grow wiser, and that we're able to support
the populations of the future?
One of the most dramatic manifestations of these improvements
will be moving from population pyramids
to what we might term population coffins.
There is unlikely to be a pension
or a retirement age in 2030.
These will be redundant concepts. And this isn't only something of the West.
type of new pyramids
that will take place in China and in many other countries.
So forget about retirements if you're young.
Forget about pensions. Think about life and where it's going to be going.
Of course, migration will become even more important.
The war on talent, the need to attract people
at all skill ranges,
to push us around in our wheelchairs,
but also to drive our economies. Our innovation will be vital.
will go down from about 800
to about 700 million of these people.
This would imply a massive leap in migration.
So the concerns, the xenophobic concerns of today,
of migration, will be turned on their head,
as we search for people to help us sort out
our pensions and our economies in the future.
And then, the systemic risks.
We understand that these will become much more virulent,
that what we see today
is this interweaving of societies, of systems,
fastened by technologies and hastened by just-in-time management systems.
Small levels of stock push resilience into other people's responsibility.
climate change, pandemics, financial crises:
these will be the currency that we will think about.
And so a new awareness will have to arise,
of how we deal with these, how we mobilize ourselves,
in a new way, and come together as a community
to manage systemic risk.
It's going to require innovation.
It's going to require an understanding that the glory of globalization
could also be its downfall.
This could be our best century ever because of the achievements,
or it could be our worst.
And of course we need to worry about the individuals,
particularly the individuals that feel that they've
been left out in one way or another.
will have the capacity, by 2030,
to destroy the planet, to wreck everything,
through the creation, for example, of a biopathogen.
How do we begin to weave these tapestries together?
How do we think about complex systems in new ways?
That will be the challenge of the scholars,
and of all of us engaged in thinking about the future.
The rest of our lives will be in the future. We need to prepare for it now.
We need to understand that the governance structure in the world is fossilized.
It cannot begin to cope with the challenges that this will bring.
We have to develop a new way of managing the planet,
collectively, through collective wisdom.
that amazing things can happen,
when individuals and societies come together
to change their future.
I left South Africa, and 15 years later,
after thinking I would never go back,
I had the privilege and the honor to work in the government of Nelson Mandela.
This was a miracle. We can create miracles,
collectively, in our lifetime.
It is vital that we do so.
It is vital that the ideas that are nurtured in TED,
that the ideas that we think about
look forward, and make sure that this will be the most glorious century,
and not one of eco-disaster and eco-collapse.
Thank you. (Applause)
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read
a newspaper article which said
that one day syringes would be
one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS,
the transmission of AIDS.
I thought this was unacceptable. So I decided to do something about it.
kills approximately one million people a year.
The reuse of syringes now exceeds that
and kills 1.3 million people a year.
This young girl and her friend
that I met in an orphanage in Delhi
were HIV positive from a syringe.
And what was so sad about this particular story
was that once their parents had found out --
and don't forget, their parents took them to the doctor --
the parents threw them out on the street.
And hence they ended up in an orphanage.
you have either skilled or unskilled practitioners,
blindly giving an injection to someone.
And the injection is so valuable,
that the people basically trust
the doctor, being second to God, which I've heard many times,
to do the right thing. But in fact they're not.
And you can understand, obviously, the transmission problem
between people in high-virus areas.
which shows you, over a half an hour period,
a tray of medicines of 42 vials,
which are being delivered with only 2 syringes in a public hospital in India.
And over the course of half an hour, not one syringe
was filmed being unwrapped.
They started with two and they ended with two.
And you'll see, just now, a nurse coming back to the tray,
which is their sort of modular station,
and dropping the syringe she's just used
back in the tray for it to be picked up and used again.
So you can imagine the scale of this problem.
And in fact in India alone, 62 percent
of all injections given
are unsafe.
They are lucky. They already have a job.
And that job is that they go around and pick up syringes
from the back of hospitals,
wash them, and in the course of this,
obviously picking them up they injure themselves.
And then they repackage them and sell them out on markets
for literally more money
than a sterile syringe in the first place, which is quite bizarre.
In an interesting photo, their father, while we were talking to him,
picked up a syringe and pricked his finger --
I don't know whether you can see the drop of blood on the end --
and immediately whipped out a box of matches,
lit one, and burned the blood off the end of his finger,
giving me full assurance
that that was the way that you stopped the transmission of HIV.
And they are collected en mass -- you can see the scale of it here --
and sorted out, by hand, back into the right sizes,
and then put back out on the street.
So recycling and reuse
are the major issues here.
But there was one interesting anecdote that I found in Indonesia.
In all schools in Indonesia,
there is usually a toy seller in the playground.
The toy seller, in this case,
had syringes, which they usually do,
next door to the diggers, which is obviously
what you would expect.
And they use them, in the breaks, for water pistols.
They squirt them at each other, which is lovely and innocent.
And they are having great fun.
But they also drink from them
while they're in their breaks, because it's hot.
And they squirt the water into their mouths.
And these are used with traces of blood visible.
And I think, if I can just borrow this camera,
I was going to show you my invention,
which I came up with.
So, it's a normal-looking syringe.
You load it up in the normal way. This is made
on existing equipment in 14 factories that we license.
You give the injection and then put it down.
If someone then tries to reuse it,
it locks and breaks afterwards.
It's very, very simple. Thank you.
(Applause)
And it costs the same as a normal syringe.
And in comparison, a Coca-Cola
is 10 times the price.
And that will stop reusing a syringe 20 or 30 times.
which has done huge scale amount of work in India.
And we're very proud of giving information to people,
so that little kids like this don't do stupid things.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
They are all, you know, warming up and doing stuff.
And I go on the podium.
You know, this little office of the conductor.
Or rather a cubicle, an open-space cubicle,
with a lot of space.
And in front of all that noise,
you do a very small gesture.
Something like this, not very pomp, not very sophisticated, this.
And suddenly, out of the chaos, order.
Noise becomes music.
to think that it's all about me.
(Laughter)
All those great people here, virtuosos,
they make noise, they need me to do that.
Not really. If it were that,
I would just save you the talk,
and teach you the gesture.
So you could go out to the world
and do this thing in whatever company or whatever you want,
and you have perfect harmony. It doesn't work.
Let's look at the first video.
I hope you'll think it's a good example of harmony.
And then speak a little bit about how it comes about.
So that was a sort of a success.
Now, who should we thank for the success?
I mean, obviously the orchestra musicians
playing beautifully,
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
They don't often even look at the conductor.
Then you have the clapping audience, yeah,
actually taking part in doing the music.
You know Viennese audiences usually don't interfere with the music.
This is the closest to an Oriental bellydancing feast
that you will ever get in Vienna.
(Laughter)
You know, Arthur Rubinstein, the pianist, used to say
(Laughter)
So that's a sort of a tradition.
But Viennese audiences do not do that.
You know, audiences like you, yeah,
make the event.
the conductor was doing, actually?
Um, he was happy.
And I often show this to senior management.
People get annoyed.
"You come to work. How come you're so happy?"
Something must be wrong there, yeah? But he's spreading happiness.
only his own story and his joy of the music.
The joy is about enabling other people's stories
to be heard at the same time.
You have the story of the audience as a community. Yeah.
You have the stories of the individuals
in the orchestra and in the audience.
And then you have other stories, unseen.
People who build this wonderful concert hall.
People who made those Stradivarius, Amati, all those beautiful instruments.
And all those stories are being heard at the same time.
This is the true experience of a live concert.
That's a reason to go out of home. Yeah?
And not all conductors do just that.
it's a completely different figure. Right?
He's awesome. He's so commanding. Yeah?
So clear. Maybe a little bit over-clear.
Can we have a little demonstration? Would you be my orchestra for a second?
Can you sing, please, the first note of Don Giovanni?
You have to sing "Aaaaaah," and I'll stop you.
Okay? Ready?
I feel even more redundant than I already feel.
So please, wait for the conductor.
Now look at me. "Aaaaaah," and I stop you. Let's go.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
But ... There is a vacancy for a ...
But -- (Laughter)
-- you could see that you could stop an orchestra with a finger.
Now what does Riccardo Muti do? He does something like this ...
(Laughter)
And then -- sort of -- (Laughter)
So not only the instruction is clear,
So, does it work? Yes, it works --
He says, "I'm responsible."
Responsible in front of him.
No he doesn't really mean Him. He means Mozart,
which is -- (Laughter) -- like a third seat from the center.
(Laughter)
So he says, "If I'm --
(Applause)
if I'm responsible for Mozart,
this is going to be the only story to be told.
It's Mozart as I, Riccardo Muti, understand it."
Three years ago he got a letter signed by
all 700 employees of La Scala,
musical employees, I mean the musicians,
saying, "You're a great conductor. We don't want to work with you. Please resign."
(Laughter)
"Why? Because you don't let us develop.
You're using us as instruments, not as partners.
And our joy of music, etc., etc. ..."
So he had to resign. Isn't that nice?
(Laughter)
He's a nice guy. He's a really nice guy.
Well, can you do it with less control,
or with a different kind of control?
Let's look at the next conductor, Richard Strauss.
It's not true. When he was a young man
of about 30, he wrote what he called
"The Ten Commandments for Conductors."
The first one was: If you sweat by the end of the concert
it means that you must have done something wrong.
That's the first one. The fourth one you'll like better.
It says: Never look at the trombones --
it happen by itself.
Do not interfere.
But how does it happen? Did you see
him turning pages in the score?
Now, either he is senile,
and doesn't remember his own music, because he wrote the music.
Or he is actually transferring a very strong message to them, saying,
It's only the execution of the written music,
no interpretation."
Interpretation is the real story of the performer.
So, no, he doesn't want that. That's a different kind of control.
Let's see another super-conductor,
a German super-conductor. Herbert von Karajan, please.
Once like a Muti, and you'll -- (Claps) -- clap, just once.
And then like Karajan. Let's see what happens. Okay?
Like Muti. You ready? Because Muti ...
(Laughter) Okay? Ready? Let's do it.
Itay Talgam: Good. Now like a Karajan. Since you're already trained,
let me concentrate, close my eyes. Come, come.
Because you didn't know when to play.
Now I can tell you, even the Berlin Philharmonic
doesn't know when to play.
(Laughter)
But I'll tell you how they do it. No cynicism.
This is a German orchestra, yes?
They look at Karajan. And then they look at each other.
(Laughter)
"Do you understand what this guy wants?"
And after doing that,
he actually says, "Yes, the worst damage
I can do to my orchestra
is to give them a clear instruction.
Because that would
prevent the ensemble, the listening to each other
that is needed for an orchestra."
Now that's great. What about the eyes?
Why are the eyes closed?
There is a wonderful story about Karajan conducting in London.
And he cues in a flute player like this.
The guy has no idea what to do. (Laughter)
"Maestro, with all due respect, when should I start?"
What do you think Karajan's reply was? When should I start?
Oh yeah. He says, "You start when you can't stand it anymore."
(Laughter)
It's my music. The real music is only in Karajan's head.
And you have to guess my mind. So you are under tremendous pressure
because I don't give you instruction,
and yet, you have to guess my mind.
So it's a different kind of, a very spiritual but yet
to the first conductor we've seen:
Carlos Kleiber, his name. Next video, please.
Well, it is different. But isn't that controlling in the same way?
No, it's not, because he is not telling them what to do.
When he does this, it's not,
"Take your Stradivarius and like Jimi Hendrix,
smash it on the floor." It's not that.
He says, "This is the gesture of the music.
I'm opening a space for you
to put in another layer
of interpretation."
That is another story.
if it doesn't give them instructions?
It's like being on a rollercoaster. Yeah?
You're not really given any instructions,
but the forces of the process itself keep you in place.
It's not a physical thing. It's in the players' heads.
You have the plan in your head.
You know what to do, even though Kleiber is not conducting you.
But here and there and that. You know what to do.
And you become a partner building the rollercoaster,
yeah, with sound,
as you actually take the ride.
This is very exciting for those players.
They do need to go to a sanatorium for two weeks, later.
(Laughter)
It is very tiring. Yeah?
But it's the best music making, like this.
and giving them a lot of physical energy.
You also have to be very professional.
And look again at this Kleiber.
Can we have the next video, quickly?
You'll see what happens when there is a mistake.
(Music)
Go along with the video. Look.
See, second time for the same player.
(Laughter) And now the third time for the same player.
(Laughter)
"Wait for me after the concert.
I have a short notice to give you."
You know, when it's needed, the authority is there. It's very important.
But authority is not enough to make people your partners.
You might be surprised having seen Kleiber
as such a hyperactive guy.
He's conducting Mozart.
(Music)
The whole orchestra is playing.
(Music)
Now something else.
(Music)
See? He is there 100 percent,
but not commanding, not telling what to do.
Rather enjoying what the soloist is doing.
(Music)
(Music)
Look at the eyes.
Okay. You see that?
First of all, it's a kind of a compliment we all like to get.
It's not feedback. It's an "Mmmm ..." Yeah, it comes from here.
So that's a good thing.
And the second thing is
it's about actually being in control,
but in a very special way.
When Kleiber does -- did you see the eyes,
going from here? (Singing)
You know what happens? Gravitation is no more.
but also creates the conditions in the world
in which this process takes place.
So again, the oboe player
is completely autonomous
and therefore happy and proud of his work,
and creative and all of that.
And the level in which Kleiber is in control is in a different level.
So control is no longer a zero-sum game.
So Kleiber is about process.
Kleiber is about conditions in the world.
Lenny Bernstein, my own personal maestro.
Since he was a great teacher,
Lenny Bernstein always started from the meaning. Look at this, please.
Well he had a wonderful expression, but only one.
(Laughter)
Did you see Lenny's face?
You know why? Because the meaning of the music is pain.
And you're playing a painful sound.
And you look at Lenny and he's suffering.
But not in a way that you want to stop.
It's suffering, like, enjoying himself in a Jewish way, as they say.
(Laughter)
But you can see the music on his face.
You can see the baton left his hand. No more baton.
Now it's about you, the player,
And even briefly, you become the storyteller
to which the community, the whole community, listens to.
And Bernstein enables that. Isn't that wonderful?
and maybe some others,
you can get to this wonderful point of doing without doing.
And for the last video, I think this is simply the best title.
My friend Peter says,
"If you love something, give it away." So, please.
One of the biggest challenges in computer graphics
has been being able to create a photo-real,
digital human face.
And one of the reasons it is so difficult is that, unlike aliens and dinosaurs,
we look at human faces every day.
They are very important to how we communicate with each other.
As a result, we're tuned in to the subtlest things
that could possibly be wrong with a computer rendering,
in order to believe whether these things are realistic.
is take you through a process
where we tried to create a reasonably photo-realistic computer-generated face,
using some computer graphics technology we've developed,
and also some collaborators at a company called Image Metrics.
And we're going to try to do a photo-real face
of an actress named Emily O'Brien, who is right there.
And that's actually a completely computer-generated rendering of her face.
By the end of the talk, we're going to see it move.
who was gracious enough to come to our laboratory
in Marina Del Rey, and sit for a session in Light Stage 5.
This is a face-scanning sphere, with 156 white LEDs all around
that allow us to photograph her
in a series of very controlled illumination conditions.
And the lighting that we use these days looks something like this.
We shoot all of these photographs in about three seconds.
with video projector patterns that drape over the contours of her face,
and different principle directions of light from the light stage,
to figure out both the coarse-scale
and the fine-scale detail of her face.
If we zoom in on this photograph right here,
we can see it's a really nice photograph to have of her,
because she is lit from absolutely everywhere at the same time
to get a nice image of her facial texture.
just like polarized sunglasses can block
the glare off of the road,
polarizers can block the shine off of the skin,
so we don't get all those specular reflections to take this map.
Now, if we turn the polarizers around just a little bit,
we can actually bring that specular reflection
of the skin back in,
and you can see she looks kind of shiny and oily at this point.
If you take the difference between these two images here,
you can get an image lit from the entire sphere of light
of just the shine off of Emily's skin.
before we had done this.
And this is very important light to capture,
because this is the light that reflects off the first surface of the skin.
It doesn't get underneath the translucent
layers of the skin and blur out.
And, as a result, it's a very good cue
to the detailed shape of the skin-pore structure
and all of the fine wrinkles that all of us have,
the things that actually make us look like real humans.
we can go from a traditional face scan
that might have the gross contours of the face and the basic shape,
and augment it with information
that puts in all of that skin pore structure and fine wrinkles.
And, even more importantly,
since this is a photometric process that only takes three seconds to capture,
we can shoot Emily
in just part of an afternoon,
in many different facial poses and facial expressions.
And these we're actually going to use to create a photo-real digital character.
If you take a look at these scans that we have of Emily,
you can see that the human face does an enormous amount of amazing things
as it goes into different facial expressions.
You can see things. Not only the face shape changes,
but all sorts of different skin buckling and skin wrinkling occurs.
You can see that the skin pore structure changes enormously
from stretched skin pores
to the regular skin texture.
You can see the furrows in the brow and how the microstructure changes there.
You can see muscles pulling down at flesh to bring her eyebrows down.
Her muscles bulging in her forehead when she winces like that.
since it's all captured with cameras, we've got a great texture map to use for the face.
And by looking at how the different color channels of the illumination,
the red and the green and the blue,
diffuse the light differently,
we can come up with a way of shading the skin on the computer.
Then, instead of looking like a plaster mannequin,
it actually looks like it's made out of living human flesh.
to give to the company Image Metrics
to create a rigged, digital version of Emily.
We're just seeing the coarse-scale geometry here.
But they basically created a digital puppet of her,
where you can pull on these various strings,
and it actually moves her face in ways that are
completely consistent with the scans that we took.
And, in addition to the coarse-scale geometry,
they also used all of that detail
to create a set of what are called "displacement maps"
that animate as well.
These are the displacement maps here.
And you can see those different wrinkles actually show up as she animates.
We actually used one of her own performances to provide the source data.
So, by analyzing this video with computer vision techniques,
they were able to drive the facial rig
with the computer-generated performance.
So what you're going to see now, after this,
is a completely photo-real digital face.
We can turn the volume up a little bit if that's available.
We specialize in high-quality facial animation
for video games and films.
Image Metrics is a markerless, performance-driven animation company.
We specialize in high quality facial animation
for video games and films.
we saw in the first slide.
Here is the specular component animating.
You can see all the wrinkles happening there.
And there is the underlying wireframe mesh.
And that is Emily herself.
We've gone a little bit beyond Light Stage 5. This is Light Stage 6,
and we're looking at taking this technology
and applying it to whole human bodies.
This is Bruce Lawmen, one of our researchers in the group,
who graciously agreed to get captured running in the Light Stage.
And let's take a look at a computer-generated version
of Bruce, running in a new environment.
And thank you very much.
(Applause)
has evaporated over the course of the last two years.
We've looked at our government oversight.
We've questioned where we're going.
that presents itself as they move forward.
Commodity prices are like this.
and it's somewhere between 50 and 70,
because the consumer, all of us, in our daily lives,
And of course our banks did as well, as did our federal government.

first of all, 360,000 dollars
is about the size of a five-foot-four guy.
So this is the first 315 billion.
So if you think about that,
almost a 3.7 percent decline.
So we're starting to pay for things with money that we have.
But that's not really the whole story,
because this has also been a dramatic time of transformation.
this was essentially our Depression.
coming in and reporting that they've had stress.
So there's an increase in people having to have their fillings replaced.
to lead us right back out.
What I mean by that is we can move from mindless consumption
to gathering all these amazing social and search tools in this decade.
But the one thing holding them back is the ability to discriminate.
By restricting their demand,
consumers can actually align their values with their spending,
We found a couple of really interesting things.
that offer new management principles.
The management principle is dollars and cents.
The first thing is, something must be happening
when P. Diddy vows to tone down his bling.
We also see the trend toward tourism that's a little bit more low-key:
agritourism -- going to vineyards and going to farms.
It takes into account everything from the pitcher match-ups,
to the weather, to the team records,
Zynga has risen on the consumer's desire
to not want to be locked in to fixed cost.
as a device to get rid of their cable bill.
We see that play itself out with empathy and respect.
The consumer is demanding it.
So we see with empathy and respect
We also talked about character and professionalism.
We had this miracle on the Hudson in New York City in January,
what companies can do is connect in lots of different ways.
Microsoft is doing something wonderful.
They are actually vowing to retrain two million Americans with IT training,
Complete transparency.
is about durable living.
We're seeing in our data that consumers are realizing
this is a marathon, not a sprint.
Witness the fact that Americans are holding on to their cars
Continuing education is up.
We also see a big DIY movement.
Perfect example of that is Patagonia.
and gives you social responsibility,
where they put solar panels on households
is this movement about "return to the fold."
It's incredibly important right now.
Trust is not parceled out, as we all know.
It's now about connecting to your communities,
connecting to your social networks.
In my book, I talked about the fact
that 72 percent of people trust what other people say
about a brand or a company,
whether it's cheeses, wines and other products.
Also this rise of local currencies.
Realizing that it's difficult to get loans in this environment,
They actually started, in certain communities in the United States,
to publish people's electricity usage.
And what they found out is when that was available for public record,
So these are consumers organizing, pooling their resources
to incentify companies to do good.
This is all the opportunity about being a community organizer.
You have to realize that you can't fight and control this.
You actually need to organize it.
So what credentials does Zagat's have?
Well, they have a lot,
because it's their network of people.
This Kogi doesn't exist. It's a moving truck.
It's a moving truck through L.A.,
And it's also become a very valuable advertising revenue for J&J as well.
allowing their employees to be part of the process,
rather than hidden behind walls.
So when we look at this and step back,
It's been tremendously powerful for consumers.
Crisis equals opportunity.
it will drive innovation;
it will make longer-lasting products;
it will create better, more intuitive customer service;
So when we look back and step out at this
we see a very hopeful picture for the future of America.
my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.
This habit of suppressing sound has meant
Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know
Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.
your productivity is greatly reduced.
And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.
With all that other stuff going on,
it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.
for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.
Every brand is out there making sound right now.
you reduce impact by 86 percent.
Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.
you can take control of the sound around you.
Our mission is to build
a detailed, realistic
computer model of the human brain.
And we've done, in the past four years,
a proof of concept
on a small part of the rodent brain,
and with this proof of concept we are now scaling the project up
to reach the human brain.
There are three important reasons.
The first is, it's essential for us to understand the human brain
if we do want to get along in society,
and I think that it is a key step in evolution.
The second reason is,
we cannot keep doing animal experimentation forever,
and we have to embody all our data and all our knowledge
into a working model.
It's like a Noah's Ark. It's like an archive.
And the third reason is that there are two billion people on the planet
that are affected by mental disorder,
and the drugs that are used today
are largely empirical.
I think that we can come up with very concrete solutions on
how to treat disorders.
we can use the brain model
to explore some fundamental questions
about how the brain works.
And here, at TED, for the first time,
I'd like to share with you how we're addressing
one theory -- there are many theories --
one theory of how the brain works.
So, this theory is that the brain
creates, builds, a version of the universe,
and projects this version of the universe,
like a bubble, all around us.
But, for the first time, we can actually address this,
with brain simulation,
and ask very systematic and rigorous questions,
whether this theory could possibly be true.
The reason why the moon is huge on the horizon
is simply because our perceptual bubble
does not stretch out 380,000 kilometers.
It runs out of space.
And so what we do is we compare the buildings
within our perceptual bubble,
and we make a decision.
We make a decision it's that big,
even though it's not that big.
is that decisions are the key things
that support our perceptual bubble. It keeps it alive.
Without decisions you cannot see, you cannot think,
you cannot feel.
And you may think that anesthetics work
by sending you into some deep sleep,
or by blocking your receptors so that you don't feel pain,
but in fact most anesthetics don't work that way.
What they do is they introduce a noise
into the brain so that the neurons cannot understand each other.
They are confused,
and you cannot make a decision.
So, while you're trying to make up your mind
what the doctor, the surgeon, is doing
while he's hacking away at your body, he's long gone.
He's at home having tea.
(Laughter)
what you compulsively have to do to perceive
is to make decisions,
thousands of decisions about the size of the room,
the walls, the height, the objects in this room.
99 percent of what you see
is not what comes in through the eyes.
It is what you infer about that room.
So I can say, with some certainty,
"I think, therefore I am."
But I cannot say, "You think, therefore you are,"
because "you" are within my perceptual bubble.
but we don't actually have to for the next hundred years.
We can ask a very concrete question.
"Can the brain build such a perception?"
Is it capable of doing it?
Does it have the substance to do it?
And that's what I'm going to describe to you today.
It had to improve it a little bit.
It had to add to the frontal part, so that you would have instincts,
because they had to cope on land.
But the real big step was the neocortex.
It's a new brain. You needed it.
The mammals needed it
because they had to cope with parenthood,
social interactions,
complex cognitive functions.
actually as the ultimate solution today,
of the universe as we know it.
It's the pinnacle, it's the final product
that the universe has produced.
It was so successful in evolution
that from mouse to man it expanded
about a thousandfold in terms of the numbers of neurons,
to produce this almost frightening
organ, structure.
And it has not stopped its evolutionary path.
In fact, the neocortex in the human brain
is evolving at an enormous speed.
you discover that it's made up of little modules,
G5 processors, like in a computer.
But there are about a million of them.
They were so successful in evolution
that what we did was to duplicate them
over and over and add more and more of them to the brain
until we ran out of space in the skull.
And the brain started to fold in on itself,
and that's why the neocortex is so highly convoluted.
We're just packing in columns,
so that we'd have more neocortical columns
to perform more complex functions.
a massive grand piano,
a million-key grand piano.
Each of these neocortical columns
would produce a note.
You stimulate it; it produces a symphony.
But it's not just a symphony of perception.
It's a symphony of your universe, your reality.
Now, of course it takes years to learn how
to master a grand piano with a million keys.
That's why you have to send your kids to good schools,
hopefully eventually to Oxford.
But it's not only education.
It's also genetics.
You may be born lucky,
where you know how to master your neocortical column,
and you can play a fantastic symphony.
called the "intense world" theory,
which suggests that the neocortical columns are super-columns.
They are highly reactive, and they are super-plastic,
and so the autists are probably capable of
building and learning a symphony
which is unthinkable for us.
But you can also understand
that if you have a disease
within one of these columns,
the note is going to be off.
The perception, the symphony that you create
is going to be corrupted,
and you will have symptoms of disease.
is really to understand the design of the neocoritical column --
and it's not just for neuroscience;
it's perhaps to understand perception, to understand reality,
and perhaps to even also understand physical reality.
So, what we did was, for the past 15 years,
was to dissect out the neocortex, systematically.
It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.
How many trees does it have?
What shapes are the trees?
How many of each type of tree do you have? Where are they positioned?
describe and discover all the rules of communication,
the rules of connectivity,
because the neurons don't just like to connect with any neuron.
They choose very carefully who they connect with.
It's also more than cataloging
because you actually have to build three-dimensional
digital models of them.
And we did that for tens of thousands of neurons,
built digital models of all the different types
of neurons we came across.
And once you have that, you can actually
begin to build the neocortical column.
But as you do this, what you see
is that the branches intersect
actually in millions of locations,
and at each of these intersections
they can form a synapse.
And a synapse is a chemical location
where they communicate with each other.
And these synapses together
form the network
or the circuit of the brain.
Now, the circuit, you could also think of as
the fabric of the brain.
And when you think of the fabric of the brain,
the structure, how is it built? What is the pattern of the carpet?
You realize that this poses
a fundamental challenge to any theory of the brain,
and especially to a theory that says
that there is some reality that emerges
out of this carpet, out of this particular carpet
with a particular pattern.
is diversity.
Every neuron is different.
It's the same in the forest. Every pine tree is different.
You may have many different types of trees,
but every pine tree is different. And in the brain it's the same.
So there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as another,
and there is no neuron in my brain that is the same as in yours.
And your neurons are not going to be oriented and positioned
in exactly the same way.
And you may have more or less neurons.
So it's very unlikely
that you got the same fabric, the same circuitry.
that we can even understand each other?
Well, we don't have to speculate.
We can look at all 10 million synapses now.
We can look at the fabric. And we can change neurons.
We can use different neurons with different variations.
We can position them in different places,
orient them in different places.
We can use less or more of them.
And when we do that
what we discovered is that the circuitry does change.
But the pattern of how the circuitry is designed does not.
So, the fabric of the brain,
even though your brain may be smaller, bigger,
it may have different types of neurons,
different morphologies of neurons,
we actually do share
the same fabric.
And we think this is species-specific,
which means that that could explain
why we can't communicate across species.
is you have to make this come alive.
We make it come alive
with equations, a lot of mathematics.
And, in fact, the equations that make neurons into electrical generators
were discovered by two Cambridge Nobel Laureates.
So, we have the mathematics to make neurons come alive.
We also have the mathematics to describe
how neurons collect information,
and how they create a little lightning bolt
to communicate with each other.
And when they get to the synapse,
what they do is they effectively,
literally, shock the synapse.
It's like electrical shock
that releases the chemicals from these synapses.
So we can describe the communication between the neurons.
There literally are only a handful
of equations that you need to simulate
the activity of the neocortex.
But what you do need is a very big computer.
And in fact you need one laptop
to do all the calculations just for one neuron.
So you need 10,000 laptops.
So where do you go? You go to IBM,
and you get a supercomputer, because they know how to take
10,000 laptops and put it into the size of a refrigerator.
So now we have this Blue Gene supercomputer.
We can load up all the neurons,
each one on to its processor,
and fire it up, and see what happens.
Take the magic carpet for a ride.
of what is happening in your brain
when there is a stimulation.
It's the first view.
Now, when you look at that the first time, you think,
"My god. How is reality coming out of that?"
But, in fact, you can start,
even though we haven't trained this neocortical column
to create a specific reality.
But we can ask, "Where is the rose?"
We can ask, "Where is it inside,
if we stimulate it with a picture?"
Where is it inside the neocortex?
Ultimately it's got to be there if we stimulated it with it.
is to ignore the neurons, ignore the synapses,
and look just at the raw electrical activity.
Because that is what it's creating.
It's creating electrical patterns.
So when we did this,
we indeed, for the first time,
saw these ghost-like structures:
electrical objects appearing
within the neocortical column.
And it's these electrical objects
that are holding all the information about
whatever stimulated it.
And then when we zoomed into this,
it's like a veritable universe.
is just to take these brain coordinates
and to project them into perceptual space.
And if you do that,
you will be able to step inside
the reality that is created
by this machine,
by this piece of the brain.
So, in summary,
I think that the universe may have --
it's possible --
evolved a brain to see itself,
which may be a first step in becoming aware of itself.
There is a lot more to do to test these theories,
and to test any other theories.
But I hope that you are at least partly convinced
that it is not impossible to build a brain.
We can do it within 10 years,
and if we do succeed,
we will send to TED, in 10 years,
a hologram to talk to you. Thank you.
(Applause)
This is my first time at TED. Normally, as an advertising man,
I actually speak at TED Evil, which is TED's secret sister
that pays all the bills.
It's held every two years in Burma.
And I particularly remember a really good speech
by Kim Jong Il on how to get teens smoking again.
(Laughter)
that what we create in advertising,
which is intangible value -- you might call it perceived value,
you might call it badge value, subjective value,
intangible value of some kind --
gets rather a bad rap.
If you think about it, if you want to live in a world in the future
where there are fewer material goods, you basically have two choices.
You can either live in a world which is poorer,
which people in general don't like.
Or you can live in a world where actually intangible value
constitutes a greater part of overall value,
that actually intangible value, in many ways
is a very, very fine substitute
for using up labor or limited resources
in the creation of things.
The question was given to a bunch of engineers,
about 15 years ago, "How do we make the journey to Paris better?"
And they came up with a very good engineering solution,
which was to spend six billion pounds
building completely new tracks
from London to the coast,
and knocking about 40 minutes off a three-and-half-hour journey time.
Now, call me Mister Picky. I'm just an ad man ...
... but it strikes me as a slightly unimaginative way of improving a train journey
merely to make it shorter.
Now what is the hedonic opportunity cost
on spending six billion pounds on those railway tracks?
What you should in fact do is employ all of the world's top male
and female supermodels,
pay them to walk the length of the train, handing out free Chateau Petrus
for the entire duration of the journey.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Now, you'll still have about three billion pounds left in change,
and people will ask for the trains to be slowed down.
(Laughter)
And this shows that engineers,
medical people, scientific people,
have an obsession with solving the problems of reality,
when actually most problems, once you reach a basic level of wealth
in society, most problems are actually problems of perception.
So I'll ask you another question.
What on earth is wrong with placebos?
They seem fantastic to me. They cost very little to develop.
They work extraordinarily well.
They have no side effects,
or if they do, they're imaginary, so you can safely ignore them.
(Laughter)
by Tyler Cowen. I don't know if anybody knows it.
Someone was actually suggesting that you can take this concept further,
and actually produce placebo education.
The point is that education doesn't actually work by teaching you things.
It actually works by giving you the impression
that you've had a very good education, which gives you an insane sense
of unwarranted self-confidence,
which then makes you very, very successful in later life.
So, welcome to Oxford, ladies and gentlemen.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
How many problems of life can be solved
actually by tinkering with perception,
rather than that tedious, hardworking and messy business
of actually trying to change reality?
Here's a great example from history. I've heard this attributed to several other kings,
but doing a bit of historical research,
it seems to be Fredrick the Great.
Fredrick the Great of Prussia was very, very keen
for the Germans to adopt the potato and to eat it,
because he realized that if you had two sources of carbohydrate,
wheat and potatoes, you get less price volatility in bread.
And you get a far lower risk of famine,
because you actually had two crops to fall back on, not one.
And also, 18th century Prussians ate very, very few vegetables --
rather like contemporary Scottish people.
(Laughter)
So, actually, he tried making it compulsory.
The Prussian peasantry said,
"We can't even get the dogs to eat these damn things.
They are absolutely disgusting and they're good for nothing."
There are even records of people being executed
for refusing to grow potatoes.
He tried the marketing solution, which is he declared the potato
as a royal vegetable, and none but the royal family could consume it.
And he planted it in a royal potato patch,
with guards who had instructions
to guard over it, night and day,
but with secret instructions not to guard it very well.
(Laughter)
Now, 18th century peasants know that there is one
pretty safe rule in life, which is if something is worth guarding,
it's worth stealing.
Before long, there was a massive underground
potato-growing operation in Germany.
What he'd effectively done is he'd re-branded the potato.
It was an absolute masterpiece.
"Very, very good marketer, Fredrick the Great. But not a patch on Ataturk."
Ataturk, rather like Nicolas Sarkozy,
was very keen to discourage the wearing of a veil,
in Turkey, to modernize it.
Now, boring people would have just simply banned the veil.
But that would have ended up with a lot of awful kickback
and a hell of a lot of resistance.
Ataturk was a lateral thinker.
He made it compulsory for prostitutes to wear the veil.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
There is your environmental problem solved, by the way, guys:
All convicted child molesters
have to drive a Porsche Cayenne.
(Laughter)
What Ataturk realized actually is two very fundamental things.
Which is that, actually, first one,
all value is actually relative.
All value is perceived value.
Because actually it's not the dollar. It's actually the peso
in Buenos Aires. Very clever Buenos Aires street vendors
decided to practice price discrimination
to the detriment of any passing gringo tourists.
As an advertising man, I have to admire that.
Second point is that persuasion is often better than compulsion.
These funny signs that flash your speed at you,
some of the new ones, on the bottom right,
now actually show a smiley face or a frowny face,
to act as an emotional trigger.
What's fascinating about these signs is they cost about 10 percent
of the running cost of a conventional speed camera,
but they prevent twice as many accidents.
So, the bizarre thing, which is baffling
to conventional, classically trained economists,
is that a weird little smiley face
has a better effect on changing your behavior
than the threat of a £60 fine and three penalty points.
in Italy, penalty points go backwards.
You start with 12 and they take them away.
Because they found that loss aversion
is a more powerful influence on people's behavior.
In Britain we tend to feel, "Whoa! Got another three!"
Not so in Italy.
to replace actual or material value, which remember, is what,
after all, the environmental movement needs to be about:
This again is from Prussia, from, I think, about 1812, 1813.
The wealthy Prussians, to help in the war against the French,
were encouraged to give in all their jewelry.
And it was replaced with replica jewelry
made of cast iron.
Here's one: "Gold gab ich für Eisen, 1813."
The interesting thing is that for 50 years hence,
the highest status jewelry you could wear in Prussia
wasn't made of gold or diamonds.
It was made of cast iron.
Because actually, never mind the actual intrinsic value
of having gold jewelry. This actually
had symbolic value, badge value.
It said that your family had made a great sacrifice in the past.
(Laughter)
But, actually, there is a thing, just as there are Veblen goods,
where the value of the good depends on it being expensive and rare --
there are opposite kind of things
where actually the value in them depends on them being
ubiquitous, classless and minimalistic.
Adam Smith talks about 18th century America,
where the prohibition against visible displays of wealth was so great,
it was almost a block in the economy in New England,
because even wealthy farmers could find nothing to spend their money on
without incurring the displeasure of their neighbors.
It's perfectly possible to create these social pressures
which lead to more egalitarian societies.
that have a high component
of what you might call messaging value,
a high component of intangible value, versus their intrinsic value:
They are often quite egalitarian.
In terms of dress, denim is perhaps the perfect example of something
which replaces material value with symbolic value.
Coca-Cola. A bunch of you may be a load of pinkos,
and you may not like the Coca-Cola company,
but it's worth remembering Andy Warhol's point about Coke.
What Warhol said about Coke is, he said,
"What I really like about Coca-Cola is the president of the United States
can't get a better Coke than the bum on the corner of the street."
Now, that is, actually, when you think about it -- we take it for granted --
it's actually a remarkable achievement,
to produce something that's that democratic.
There is a basic view that real value involves making things,
involves labor. It involves engineering.
It involves limited raw materials.
And that what we add on top is kind of false. It's a fake version.
And there is a reason for some suspicion and uncertainly about it.
It patently veers toward propaganda.
However, what we do have now
is a much more variegated media ecosystem
in which to kind of create this kind of value, and it's much fairer.
as translated into food.
You had a monopoly supplier. On the left,
you have Rupert Murdoch, or the BBC.
(Laughter)
And on your right you have a dependent public
which is pathetically grateful for anything you give it.
(Laughter)
This is actually what's called, in the digital world, "user-generated content."
Although it's called agriculture in the world of food.
(Laughter)
This is actually called a mash-up,
where you take content that someone else has produced
and you do something new with it.
In the world of food we call it cooking.
This is food 2.0,
which is food you produce for the purpose of sharing it with other people.
This is mobile food. British are very good at that.
Fish and chips in newspaper, the Cornish Pasty,
the pie, the sandwich.
We invented the whole lot of them.
We're not very good at food in general. Italians do great food,
but it's not very portable, generally.
(Laughter)
He actually invented the toasty. But then, the Earl of Toasty would be a ridiculous name.
(Laughter)
Now, the reason I show you Pernod -- it's only one example.
Every country has a contextual alcoholic drink. In France it's Pernod.
It tastes great within the borders of that country,
but absolute shite if you take it anywhere else.
(Laughter)
Unicum in Hungary, for example.
The Greeks have actually managed to produce something called Retsina,
which even tastes shite when you're in Greece.
(Laughter)
that the capacity for actually nudging people,
for giving them better information -- B.J. Fogg,
at the University of Stanford, makes the point
that actually the mobile phone is --
He's invented the phrase, "persuasive technologies."
He believes the mobile phone, by being location-specific,
contextual, timely and immediate,
is simply the greatest persuasive technology device ever invented.
we simply have to ask the question,
and Thaler and Sunstein have, of how we can use these more intelligently.
I'll give you one example.
If you had a large red button of this kind, on the wall of your home,
and every time you pressed it, it saved 50 dollars for you,
put 50 dollars into your pension,
you would save a lot more.
The reason is that the interface fundamentally determines
the behavior. Okay?
opportunities for impulse buying.
Yet we've never created the opportunity for impulse saving.
If you did this, more people would save more.
It's simply a question of changing the interface
by which people make decisions,
and the very nature of the decisions changes.
Obviously, I don't want people to do this,
because as an advertising man I tend to regard saving as just
consumerism needlessly postponed.
(Laughter)
But if anybody did want to do that,
that's the kind of thing we need to be thinking about, actually:
fundamental opportunities to change human behavior.
There was a young intern at Ogilvy Canada
called Hunter Somerville,
who was working in improv in Toronto,
and got a part-time job in advertising,
and was given the job of advertising Shreddies.
Now this is the most perfect case of creating
intangible, added value,
without changing the product in the slightest.
Shreddies is a strange, square, whole-grain cereal,
only available in New Zealand, Canada and Britain.
It's Kraft's peculiar way of rewarding loyalty to the crown.
(Laughter)
In working out how you could re-launch Shreddies,
he came up with this.
Man: Shreddies is supposed to be square.
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
Same 100 percent whole-grain wheat in a delicious diamond shape.
(Applause)
of intangible value creation. All it requires is
photons, neurons, and a great idea to create this thing.
I would say it's a work of genius.
But, naturally, you can't do this kind of thing without a little bit of market research.
which is something very exciting for them.
So they are introducing new Diamond Shreddies.
(Laughter)
So I just want to get your first impressions when you see that,
when you see the Diamond Shreddies box there.
(Laughter)
But it's kind of like flipping a six or a nine. Like a six,
if you flip it over it looks like a nine.
But a six is very different from a nine.
You just looked like you turned it on its end. But when you see it like that
it's more interesting looking.
Take a square one there, first.
(Laughter)
Man: Which one did you prefer? Man #2: The first one.
(Laughter)
There were conservative elements in Canada, unsurprisingly,
who actually resented this intrusion.
So, eventually, the manufacturers actually
arrived at a compromise, which was the combo pack.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
(Laughter)
the American Institute of Wine Economics,
which actually does extensive research into perception of things,
and discovers that except for among
perhaps five or ten percent of the most knowledgeable people,
there is no correlation between quality and enjoyment
in wine,
except when you tell the people how expensive it is,
in which case they tend to enjoy the more expensive stuff more.
So drink your wine blind in the future.
but I think an important philosophical point,
which is, going forward, we need more of this kind of value.
We need to spend more time appreciating what already exists,
and less time agonizing over what else we can do.
One of them is, "Poetry is when you make new things
familiar and familiar things new."
Which isn't a bad definition of what our job is,
to help people appreciate what is unfamiliar, but also
to gain a greater appreciation, and place a far higher value on
those things which are already existing.
There is some evidence, by the way, that things like social networking help do that.
Because they help people share news.
They give badge value to everyday little trivial activities.
So they actually reduce the need for actually spending great money on display,
and increase the kind of third-party
enjoyment you can get from the smallest, simplest things in life. Which is magic.
which is, "We are perishing for want of wonder, not for want of wonders,"
which I think for anybody involved in technology, is perfectly true.
And a final thing: When you place a value on things like health,
love, sex and other things,
and learn to place a material value
on what you've previously discounted
for being merely intangible, a thing not seen,
you realize you're much, much wealthier than you ever imagined.
Thank you very much indeed.
(Applause)
I'm Dr. David Hanson, and I build robots with character.
And by that, I mean
that I develop robots that are characters,
but also robots that will eventually
come to empathize with you.
So we're starting with a variety of technologies
that have converged into these conversational character robots
that can see faces, make eye contact with you,
make a full range of facial expressions, understand speech
and begin to model how you're feeling
and who you are, and build a relationship with you.
that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions
than previously achieved, on lower power,
which enabled the walking biped robots, the first androids.
So, it's a full range of facial expressions
simulating all the major muscles in the human face,
running on very small batteries,
extremely lightweight.
is a material that we call Frubber,
and it actually has three major innovations
in the material that allow this to happen.
One is hierarchical pores,
and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material.
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology.
I built the head. They built the body.
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines,
and not just sentience, but empathy.
at the U.C. San Diego.
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology
that recognizes facial expressions,
what facial expressions you're making.
It also recognizes where you're looking, your head orientation.
We're emulating all the major facial expressions,
and then controlling it with the software
that we call the Character Engine.
And here is a little bit of the technology that's involved in that.
and now let's see if it gets my facial expressions.
Okay. So I'm smiling.
(Laughter)
Now I'm frowning.
And this is really heavily backlit.
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's so sad.
Okay, so you smile, frowning.
So his perception of your emotional states
is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic.
of things like killing. Right?
Those machines have no place for empathy.
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that.
Character robotics could plant the seed
for robots that actually have empathy.
So, if they achieve human level intelligence
or, quite possibly, greater than human levels of intelligence,
this could be the seeds of hope for our future.
And then I started Hanson Robotics,
which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing.
This is one of our robots
that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago.
And it sees multiple people in a scene,
remembers where individual people are,
and looks from person to person, remembering people.
One, the perception of people,
and two, the natural interface,
the natural form of the interface,
so that it's more intuitive for you to interact with the robot.
You start to believe that it's alive and aware.
in an artistic display of an android portrait
of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick,
who wrote great works like, "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"
which was the basis of the movie "Bladerunner."
In these stories, robots often think
that they're human, and they sort of come to life.
So we put his writings, letters,
his interviews, correspondences,
into a huge database of thousands of pages,
and then used some natural language processing
to allow you to actually have a conversation with him.
And it was kind of spooky, because he would say these things
that just sounded like they really understood you.
which is a little character that's a spokesbot
for friendly artificial intelligence, friendly machine intelligence.
And we're getting this mass-manufactured.
We specked it out to actually be doable
with a very, very low-cost bill of materials,
so that it can become a childhood companion for kids.
Interfacing with the Internet, it gets smarter over the years.
As artificial intelligence evolves, so does his intelligence.
(Applause)
The substance of things unseen.
Cities, past and future.
In Oxford, perhaps we can use Lewis Carroll
and look in the looking glass that is New York City
to try and see our true selves,
or perhaps pass through to another world.
Or, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald,
"As the moon rose higher,
the inessential houses began to melt away
until gradually I became aware of the old island
here that once flowered for Dutch sailors' eyes,
a fresh green breast of the new world."
to rediscover this lost world
in a project we call The Mannahatta Project.
We're trying to discover what Henry Hudson would have seen
on the afternoon of September 12th, 1609,
when he sailed into New York harbor.
And I'd like to tell you the story in three acts,
and if I have time still, an epilogue.
So, I didn't grow up in New York.
I grew up out west in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, like you see here,
in the Red Rock Canyon.
And from these early experiences as a child
I learned to love landscapes.
And so when it became time for me to do my graduate studies,
I studied this emerging field of landscape ecology.
Landscape ecology concerns itself
with how the stream and the meadow and the forest and the cliffs
make habitats for plants and animals.
This experience and this training
lead me to get a wonderful job with the Wildlife Conservation Society,
which works to save wildlife and wild places all over the world.
And over the last decade,
I traveled to over 40 countries
to see jaguars and bears and elephants
and tigers and rhinos.
And on my weekends I would go up, just like all the other tourists,
to the top of the Empire State Building,
and I'd look down on this landscape, on these ecosystems,
and I'd wonder, "How does this landscape
work to make habitat for plants and animals?
How does it work to make habitat for animals like me?"
I'd go to Times Square and I'd look at the amazing ladies on the wall,
and wonder why nobody is looking at the historical figures just behind them.
I'd go to Central Park and see the rolling topography of Central Park
come up against the abrupt and sheer
topography of midtown Manhattan.
I read that New York City was the first mega-city,
a city of 10 million people or more, in 1950.
I started seeing paintings like this.
For those of you who are from New York,
this is 125th street under the West Side Highway.
(Laughter)
It was once a beach. And this painting
has John James Audubon, the painter, sitting on the rock.
And it's looking up on the wooded heights of Washington Heights
to Jeffrey's Hook, where the George Washington Bridge goes across today.
Those are two students at King's College -- later Columbia University --
sitting on a hill, overlooking a valley.
And so I'd go down to Greenwich Village and I'd look for this hill,
and I couldn't find it. And I couldn't find that palm tree.
What's that palm tree doing there?
(Laughter)
And it's this map you see here.
It's held in a geographic information system
which allows me to zoom in.
This map isn't from Hudson's time, but from the American Revolution,
170 years later, made by British military cartographers
during the occupation of New York City.
And it's a remarkable map. It's in the National Archives here in Kew.
And it's 10 feet long and three and a half feet wide.
you can see the extent of New York City as it was,
right at the end of the American Revolution.
Here's Bowling Green. And here's Broadway.
And this is City Hall Park.
So the city basically extended to City Hall Park.
And just beyond it you can see features
that have vanished, things that have disappeared.
This is the Collect Pond, which was the fresh water source for New York City
for its first 200 years,
and for the Native Americans for thousands of years before that.
You can see the Lispenard Meadows
draining down through here, through what is TriBeCa now,
and the beaches that come up from the Battery,
all the way to 42nd St.
They're mapping the roads, the buildings, these fortifications
that they built.
But they're also mapping things of ecological interest,
also military interest: the hills,
the marshes, the streams.
This is Richmond Hill, and Minetta Water,
which used to run its way through Greenwich Village.
Or the swamp at Gramercy Park, right here.
Or Murray Hill. And this is the Murrays' house
on Murray Hill, 200 years ago.
Here is Times Square,
the two streams that came together to make a wetland
in Times Square, as it was at the end of the American Revolution.
And I thought to myself, "You know, if I could georeference this map,
if I could place this map in the grid of the city today,
I could find these lost features
of the city,
in the block-by-block geography that people know,
the geography of where people go to work, and where they go to live,
and where they like to eat."
So, after some work we were able to georeference it,
which allows us to put the modern streets on the city,
and the buildings, and the open spaces,
so that we can zoom in to where the Collect Pond is.
We can digitize the Collect Pond and the streams,
and see where they actually are in the geography of the city today.
So this is fun for finding where things are
relative to the old topography.
If we take away the streets, and if we take away the buildings,
and if we take away the open spaces,
then we could take this map.
If we pull off the 18th century features
we could drive it back in time.
We could drive it back to its ecological fundamentals:
to the hills, to the streams,
to the basic hydrology and shoreline, to the beaches,
the basic aspects that make the ecological landscape.
and the surface geology, what the glaciers leave,
if we make the soil map,
with the 17 soil classes,
that are defined by the National Conservation Service,
if we make a digital elevation model
of the topography that tells us how high the hills were,
then we can calculate the slopes.
We can calculate the aspect.
We can calculate the winter wind exposure --
so, which way the winter winds blow across the landscape.
The white areas on this map are the places protected from the winter winds.
And we built a probability map of where they might have been.
So, the red areas on this map indicate the places
that are best for human sustainability on Manhattan,
places that are close to water,
places that are near the harbor to fish,
places protected from the winter winds.
We know that there was a Lenape settlement
down here by the Collect Pond.
And we knew that they planted a kind of horticulture,
that they grew these beautiful gardens of corn, beans, and squash,
the "Three Sisters" garden.
And the old fields, the successional fields that go.
And we might think of these as abandoned.
But, in fact, they're grassland habitats
for grassland birds and plants.
And they have become successional shrub lands,
and these then mix in to a map of all the ecological communities.
And it turns out that Manhattan had 55 different ecosystem types.
You can think of these as neighborhoods,
as distinctive as TriBeCa and the Upper East Side and Inwood --
that these are the forest and the wetlands
and the marine communities, the beaches.
Manhattan had more ecological communities
per acre than Yosemite does,
than Yellowstone, than Amboseli.
It was really an extraordinary landscape
that was capable of supporting an extraordinary biodiversity.
So, we studied the fish and the frogs and the birds and the bees,
the 85 different kinds of fish that were on Manhattan,
the Heath hens, the species that aren't there anymore,
the beavers on all the streams, the black bears,
and the Native Americans, to study how they used
and thought about their landscape.
We wanted to try and map these. And to do that what we did
was we mapped their habitat needs.
Where do they get their water? Where do they get their shelter?
Where do they get their reproductive resources?
To an ecologist, the intersection of these is habitat,
but to most people, the intersection of these is their home.
So, we would read in field guides, the standard field guides
that maybe you have on your shelves,
you know, what beavers need is, "A slowly meandering stream
with aspen trees and alders and willows,
near the water." That's the best thing for a beaver.
Here is the beaver. And here is the stream,
and the aspen and the alder and the willow.
As if these were the maps that we would need
to predict where you would find the beaver.
Or the bog turtle, needing wet meadows and insects and sunny places.
Or the bobcat, needing rabbits and beavers and den sites.
And rapidly we started to realize that beavers can be
something that a bobcat needs.
But a beaver also needs things. And that having it
on either side means that we can link it together,
that we can create the network
of the habitat relationships for these species.
as being a beaver specialist,
but you can look up what an aspen needs.
An aspen needs fire and dry soils.
And you can look at what a wet meadow needs.
And it need beavers to create the wetlands,
and maybe some other things.
But you can also talk about sunny places.
So, what does a sunny place need? Not habitat per se.
But what are the conditions that make it possible?
Or fire. Or dry soils.
across the top and 1,000 rows down the other way.
And then we can visualize this data like a network,
like a social network.
of all the plants and animals on Manhattan,
and everything they needed,
going back to the geology,
going back to time and space at the very core of the web.
We call this the Muir Web. And if you zoom in on it it looks like this.
Each point is a different species
or a different stream or a different soil type.
And those little gray lines are the connections that connect them together.
They are the connections that actually make nature resilient.
And the structure of this is what makes nature work,
seen with all its parts.
We call these Muir Webs after the Scottish-American naturalist
John Muir, who said, "When we try to pick out anything by itself,
we find that it's bound fast by a thousand invisible cords
that cannot be broken, to everything in the universe."
So if we wanted to go between 85th and 86th,
and Lex and Third,
maybe there was a stream in that block.
And these would be the kind of trees that might have been there,
and the flowers and the lichens and the mosses,
the butterflies, the fish in the stream,
the birds in the trees.
Maybe a timber rattlesnake lived there.
And perhaps a black bear walked by. And maybe Native Americans were there.
And then we took this data.
You can zoom into any block on Manhattan,
and see what might have been there 400 years ago.
And we used it to try and reveal a landscape
here in Act III.
We used the tools they use in Hollywood
to make these fantastic landscapes that we all see in the movies.
So we would take the landscape and we would build up the topography.
We'd lay on top of that the soils and the waters, and illuminate the landscape.
We would lay on top of that the map of the ecological communities.
And feed into that the map of the species.
So that we would actually take a photograph,
flying above Times Square, looking toward the Hudson River,
waiting for Hudson to come.
Using this technology, we can make these
fantastic georeferenced views.
We can basically take a picture out of any window
on Manhattan and see what that landscape looked like 400 years ago.
at where the United Nations is today.
This is the view looking down the Hudson River,
with Manhattan on the left, and New Jersey out on the right,
looking out toward the Atlantic Ocean.
This is the view over Times Square,
with the beaver pond there, looking out toward the east.
So we can see the Collect Pond, and Lispenard Marshes back behind.
We can see the fields that the Native Americans made.
And we can see this in the geography of the city today.
So when you're watching "Law and Order," and the lawyers walk up the steps
they could have walked back down those steps
of the New York Court House, right into the Collect Pond,
400 years ago.
Mark Boyer, who is here in the audience today.
And I'd just like, if you would give him a hand,
to call out for his fine work.
(Applause)
that we can create images like this,
perhaps looking on either side of a looking glass.
And even though I've only had a brief time to speak,
I hope you appreciate that Mannahatta was a very special place.
The place that you see here on the left side
was interconnected. It was based on this diversity.
It had this resilience that is what we need in our modern world.
on the right, which I quite do. I've come to love the city
and its kind of diversity, and its resilience,
and its dependence on density and how we're connected together.
In fact, that I see them as reflections of each other,
much as Lewis Carroll did in "Through the Looking Glass."
We can compare these two and hold them in our minds at the same time,
that they really are the same place,
that there is no way that cities can escape from nature.
And I think this is what we're learning about building cities in the future.
but about 400 years from now,
what we're realizing is that
cities are habitats for people,
and need to supply what people need:
a sense of home, food, water, shelter,
reproductive resources, and a sense of meaning.
This is the particular additional habitat requirement of humanity.
And so many of the talks here at TED are about meaning,
about bringing meaning to our lives
in all kinds of different ways, through technology,
through art, through science,
so much so that I think we focus so much on
that side of our lives, that we haven't given enough
attention to the food and the water and the shelter,
and what we need to raise the kids.
Well, what if we go to Madison Square Park,
and we imagine it without all the cars,
and bicycles instead
and large forests, and streams instead of sewers and storm drains?
What if we imagined the Upper East Side
with green roofs, and streams winding through the city,
and windmills supplying the power we need?
Or if we imagine the New York City metropolitan area,
currently home to 12 million people,
but 12 million people in the future, perhaps living at the density of Manhattan,
in only 36 percent of the area,
with the areas in between covered by farmland,
covered by the marshes we need.
is a future that has the same diversity
and abundance and dynamism of Manhattan,
but that learns from the sustainability of the past,
of the ecology, the original ecology, of nature with all its parts.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
So, I am indeed going to talk about
the spaces men create for themselves,
but first I want to tell you why I'm here.
I'm here for two reasons. These two guys
are my two sons Ford and Wren.
When Ford was about three years old,
we shared a very small room together,
in a very small space.
My office was on one half of the bedroom,
and his bedroom was on the other half.
And you can imagine, if you're a writer,
that things would get really crowded around deadlines.
I realized I needed to find a space of my own.
There was no more space in the house. So I went out to the backyard,
and without any previous building experience,
and about 3,000 dollars and some
recycled materials, I built this space.
It had everything I needed. It was quiet.
There was enough space. And I had control, which was very important.
to myself, "Surely I'm not the only guy
to have to have carved out a space for his own."
So I did some research.
And I found that there was an historic precedence.
Hemingway had his writing space.
Elvis had two or three manspaces,
which is pretty unique because he lived with both his wife and his mother in Graceland.
In the popular culture, Superman had the Fortress of Solitude,
and there was, of course, the Batcave.
and see what guys were creating for themselves now.
Here is one of the first spaces I found. It is in Austin, Texas,
which is where I'm from.
On the outside it looks like a very typical garage, a nice garage.
But on the inside, it's anything but.
And this, to me, is a pretty classic manspace.
It has neon concert posters, a bar
and, of course, the leg lamp,
which is very important.
This guy built a bowling alley in his backyard,
out of landscaping timbers, astroturf.
And he found the scoreboard in the trash.
This a 1923 wooden tugboat,
made completely out of Douglas fir.
The guy did it all himself.
And there is about 1,000 square feet of hanging-out space inside.
I realized what I was finding was not what I expected to find,
which was, quite frankly, a lot of beer can pyramids
and overstuffed couches and flat-screen TVs.
There were definitely hang-out spots.
But some were for working, some were for playing,
some were for guys to collect their things.
Most of all, I was just surprised with what I was finding.
On the outside it looks like a typical northeastern garage.
This is in Long Island, New York.
The only thing that might tip you off is the round window.
On the inside it's a recreation of a
16th century Japanese tea house.
The man imported all the materials from Japan,
and he hired a Japanese carpenter
to build it in the traditional style.
It has no nails or screws.
All the joints are hand-carved and hand-scribed.
But you open one of the garage doors
and there is a professional-size boxing ring inside.
(Laughter)
And so there is a good reason for this.
It was built by this man who is Wayne McCullough.
He won the silver medal for Ireland
in the 1992 Olympics,
and he trains in this space. He trains other people.
And right off the garage he has his own trophy room
where he can sort of bask in his accomplishments,
which is another sort of important part about a manspace.
this one certainly represents a passion.
It's made to look like the inside of an English sailing ship.
It's a collection of nautical antiques from the 1700s and 1800s.
Museum quality.
I found over 50 spaces.
And they were unexpected and they were surprising.
But they were also --
I was really impressed by how personalized they were,
and how much work went into them.
And I realized that's because the guys that I met
were all very passionate about what they did.
And they really loved their professions.
And they were very passionate about their collections and their hobbies.
And so they created these spaces
to reflect what they love to do,
and who they were.
I highly recommend finding one, and getting into it.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I want to start with a game. Okay?
And to win this game,
all you have to do is see the reality that's in front of you
as it really is, all right?
And you have to tell me which one.
Really? Okay.
Because nearly every living system
What I'm going to talk about is not that context is everything,
but why context is everything.
but who we are as individuals,
And instead of telling you, I'll just show you.
What you see here is a jungle scene,
Now, can any of you see the predator that's about to jump out at you?
the similarities and differences between surfaces,
according to the full spectrum of light that they reflect.
we have no direct access to our physical world,
other than through our senses.
And the light that falls onto our eyes
is determined by multiple things in the world,
not only the color of objects,
but also the color of their illumination,
and the color of the space between us and those objects.
You vary any one of those parameters,
Identical in shape, size, spectral content.
in shadow, oriented facing the left,
viewed through a pinkish medium.
The one on the left comes from an orange surface,
giving rise to the exact same retinal information.
So if you remember anything in this next 18 minutes,
sensory information, is meaningless,
The brain evolved the mechanisms for finding patterns,
finding relationships in information,
a significance, by interacting with the world.
We're very aware of this
in the form of more cognitive attributes, like language.
I'm going to give you some letter strings,
and I want you to read them out for me, if you can.
"You are not reading this."
"What are you reading?"
There's no a priori reason
why an "H" has to go between that "W" and "A."
But you put one there. Why?
Because in the statistics of your past experience,
And yet you don't put a letter after that first "T."
Why? Because it wouldn't have been useful in the past.
So you don't do it again.
Now I want you to look at that dot
between the green and the red.
And I want you to stare at that dot. Don't look anywhere else.
I'll tell you what's happening in your head.
the left side of its visual field is under green illumination.
That's what it's learning. Okay?
Now, when I tell you, I want you to look at the dot between the two desert scenes.
So why don't you do that now?
Here we have that exact same illusion.
We have two identical tiles on the left,
one in a dark surround, one in a light surround.
And the same thing over on the right.
Now, I'll reveal those two scenes,
And see what happens to your perception.
the two tiles look nearly completely opposite:
and reflecting the same amount of light to your eye
as the one outside the shadow,
then they must be equally reflective.
So you see it that way.
Which means we can bring all this information together
to create some incredibly strong illusions.
And you'll notice you see a dark brown tile at the top,
and a bright orange tile at the side.
That is your perceptual reality.
The four blue tiles on the left are gray.
And for all of you, you'll see it probably spinning this direction.
Now I want you to keep looking at it.
Move your eyes around, blink, maybe close one eye.
And suddenly it will flip, and start spinning the opposite direction.
Yes? Raise your hand if you got that. Yes?
Your brain doesn't know, because both are equally likely.
So depending on where it looks,
it flips between the two possibilities.
The answer to this question is no.
Even the beautiful bumblebee,
So in my lab we work on bumblebees,
You'll see one of the bees come out here.
You see how she has a little number on her?
There's another one coming out, she also has a number on her.
Now, they're not born that way, right?
She's drinking a glass of water that's about that big to you and I,
And sometimes they learn not to go to the blue,
but to go where the other bees go.
And she'll come into the hive, find an empty honey pot,
and throw up, and that's honey.
but what are these bees doing in the upper right corner?
It looks like they're going to green flowers.
Now, are they getting it wrong?
So they're using the relationships between the colors to solve the puzzle,
which is exactly what we do.
that the brain didn't actually evolve to see the world the way it is.
the way it was useful to see in the past.
and get people to experience their world differently?
Well, one of the ways we do it in my lab and studio
is we translate the light into sound,
And they can navigate the world using their ears.
And you'll see there's a faint line going across that image.
That line is broken up into 32 squares.
In each square, we calculate the average color.
and find a plate on the ground with his eyes closed.
how people literally make sense of the world.
they created images,
thinking about what might the images you see
sound like if we could listen to them.
And then we translated these images.
And this is one of those images.
And this is a six-year-old child composing a piece of music
for a 32-piece orchestra.
And this is what it sounds like.
We're not defined by our central properties,
by the bits that make us up.
We're defined by our environment and our interaction with that environment,
by our ecology.
I'd like to do this one.
So, if we have the lights down.
and 25, call it yellowish, surfaces on your right?
So now, what I want to do,
Agreed? Yes?
Okay. So they are physically the same.
you know that the middle nine are exactly the same.
The question is, "Is that an illusion?"
And I'll leave you with that.
I'm a storyteller.
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories
about what I like to call "the danger of the single story."
My mother says that I started reading at the age of two,
So I was an early reader,
and what I read were British and American children's books.
and when I began to write, at about the age of seven,
stories in pencil with crayon illustrations
All my characters were white and blue-eyed,
they played in the snow,
they ate apples,
how lovely it was that the sun had come out.
We didn't have snow, we ate mangoes,
and we never talked about the weather,
because there was no need to.
because the characters in the British books I read
drank ginger beer.
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was.
But that is another story.
in the face of a story,
There weren't many of them available,
I realized that people like me,
girls with skin the color of chocolate,
They stirred my imagination. They opened up new worlds for me.
But the unintended consequence
was that I did not know that people like me
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this:
My father was a professor.
And so we had, as was the norm,
live-in domestic help, who would often come from nearby rural villages.
So I felt enormous pity for Fide's family.
and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket
made of dyed raffia that his brother had made.
I was startled.
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family
could actually make something.
All I had heard about them was how poor they were,
I was 19.
She asked if she could listen to what she called my "tribal music,"
and was consequently very disappointed
when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey.
My roommate had a single story of Africa:
In this single story,
there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way,
no possibility of feelings more complex than pity,
no possibility of a connection as human equals.
But in the U.S., whenever Africa came up, people turned to me.
But I did come to embrace this new identity,
and in many ways I think of myself now as African.
the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight
about the charity work in "India, Africa and other countries."
and incomprehensible people,
I would see Africans in the same way that I,
who sailed to west Africa in 1561
he writes, "They are also people without heads,
But what is important about his writing
is that it represents the beginning
of a tradition of telling African stories in the West:
A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives,
must have throughout her life
as had a professor,
Now, I was quite willing to contend
but I had not quite imagined that it had failed
at achieving something called African authenticity.
an educated and middle-class man.
And, as often happens in America,
immigration became synonymous with Mexicans.
sneaking across the border,
watching the people going to work,
rolling up tortillas in the marketplace,
I remember first feeling slight surprise.
And then, I was overwhelmed with shame.
that they had become one thing in my mind,
I had bought into the single story of Mexicans
and I could not have been more ashamed of myself.
as only one thing,
over and over again,
There is a word, an Igbo word,
How they are told, who tells them,
when they're told, how many stories are told,
but to make it the definitive story of that person.
The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes
that if you want to dispossess a people,
the simplest way to do it is to tell their story
Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans,
and not with the arrival of the British,
and you have an entirely different story.
and not with the colonial creation of the African state,
that Nigerian men were physical abusers
that young Americans were serial murderers.
This is not because I am a better person than that student,
but because of America's cultural and economic power,
I had many stories of America.
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill.
I did not have a single story of America.
to be successful,
full of laughter and love, in a very close-knit family.
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare.
One of my closest friends, Okoloma, died in a plane crash
because our fire trucks did not have water.
I grew up under repressive military governments
that devalued education,
so that sometimes, my parents were not paid their salaries.
And so, as a child, I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table,
then margarine disappeared,
But to insist on only these negative stories
is to flatten my experience
The single story creates stereotypes,
but that they are incomplete.
and depressing ones,
to engage properly with a place or a person
without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person.
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult.
the U.S. and the Mexican?
What if my mother had told us that Fide's family was poor
and hardworking?
What if we had an African television network
that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world?
Muhtar Bakare,
a remarkable man who left his job in a bank
to follow his dream and start a publishing house?
Now, the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don't read literature.
if you made literature affordable and available to them.
I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview,
and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said,
"I really liked your novel. I didn't like the ending.
Now, you must write a sequel, and this is what will happen ..."
Here was a woman, part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians,
She had not only read the book,
a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos,
and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget?
that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week?
What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music,
talented people singing in English and Pidgin,
and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo,
mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela
that required women to get their husband's consent
before renewing their passports?
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood,
full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds,
films so popular
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider,
who has just started her own business selling hair extensions?
with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians:
our failed infrastructure, our failed government,
but also by the incredible resilience
of people who thrive despite the government,
I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer,
and it is amazing to me how many people apply,
how many people are eager to write,
called Farafina Trust,
and we have big dreams of building libraries
and refurbishing libraries that already exist
and providing books for state schools
that don't have anything in their libraries,
for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories.
Many stories matter.
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign,
but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize.
She introduced them to a book about
listening to me read the book, and a kind of paradise was regained."
That when we reject the single story,
when we realize that there is never a single story
about any place,
we regain a kind of paradise.
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."
Okay, so how exactly do we create this
world-shattering, if you will, innovation?
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.
We'll go back a little more than a year.
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know
if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?
It was February 3rd, 2008.
Anyone remember what happened,
February 3rd, 2008?
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.
is that what my colleagues, John King
and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed
as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,
is that it seemed to us
that across the United States,
if you will, tribal councils had convened.
And they had discussed things of great national importance.
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.
it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.
But when we talked to people,
it appeared that a funnel effect had happened
in these tribes all across the United States.
Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of
about 20 -- so kind of more than a team --
20 to about 150 people.
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.
But not just work. It's within these tribes
that societies get built,
that important things happen.
from various tribal councils that met,
also known as Super Bowl parties,
we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.
We said, "The tribes that we're in
are saying it's going to be Obama."
Now, the reason we knew that
was because we spent the previous 10 years
studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.
In walking around at the break,
many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,
which is to find someone
who is a member of a tribe,
and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,
and make introductions.
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.
If you focus in on a group like this --
this happens to be a USC game --
and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras
and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,
you would in fact see not a single crowd,
just like there is not a single crowd here,
but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.
And so people form tribes.
They always have. They always will.
Just as fish swim and birds fly,
people form tribes. It's just what we do.
But here's the rub.
Not all tribes are the same,
and what makes the difference is the culture.
You're all a member of tribes.
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in
and nudge them forward,
along these tribal stages
to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.
You don't want this. Okay?
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.
who do horrible things.
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.
Stage One is a group where people
systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,
and then pool together
with people who think like they do.
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs
and it is the culture of prisons.
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.
And I want to make the point
that as members of society, we need to.
It's not enough to simply write people off.
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."
So, this other book that Steve mentioned,
that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"
my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,
argue that as people see the world, so they behave.
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,
then their behavior will follow automatically from that.
It will be despairing hostility.
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,
even if that means undermining other people.
and my driver's license expires.
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon
I will be walking into what we call
a Stage Two tribe,
which looks like this.
(Laughter)
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles
across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?
No. But in the one near me,
where I have to go in just a few days,
what I will say when I'm standing in line is,
"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"
(Laughter)
Actually, no, I'm not.
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.
So in a Stage Two culture --
and we find these in all sorts of different places --
you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.
You find them in all places in society.
I've come across them at the organizations
that everybody raves about as being best in class.
But here is the point. If you believe and you say
to people in your tribe, in effect,
"My life sucks.
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC
my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.
What kind of innovation would get done?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?
In fact it would be basically nil.
that hits closest to home for many of us.
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.
And we park. And we stay.
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."
(Laughter)
I'm great and you're not.
Now imagine having a whole room of people
saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you
and come out on top as a result of that."
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article
in the New England Journal of Medicine?"
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"
"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --
notice the condescending tone --
"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries
than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."
"Well, while you were off doing your research,
and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,
that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,
or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,
I was off running the future of the residency program,
which is really the future of medicine."
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.
Now, we find these in places
where really smart, successful people show up.
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.
(Laughter)
It is moving from Stage Three
to Stage Four.
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.
And my question on the other side is just going to be,
"What do you think they value?"
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.
This is their lobby.
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.
Notice people are applauding for us.
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did
they probably wouldn't applaud.
But you'll notice the level of excitement.
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.
Now, what's important to people at Zappos,
these may not be the things that are important to you.
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.
and find something that unites them
that's greater than their individual competence,
then something very important happens.
The group gels. And it changes
from a group of highly motivated
but fairly individually-centric people
into something larger,
into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.
There is, in fact, another stage.
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"
this may seem a little incongruous.
This is a scene or snippet
from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa
for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.
Now think about that. South Africa,
terrible atrocities had happened in the society.
And people came together
focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.
There was no road map. No one had ever done
anything like this before.
was people's values and their noble cause,
what this group accomplished was historic.
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa
would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,
descending into one skirmish after another
in a civil war that seems to have no end.
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu
set up a Stage Five process
to involve the thousands and perhaps millions
of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.
So, people hear this and they conclude the following,
as did we in doing the study.
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?
I don't want to talk like they do
at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.
I really don't want to just say "I'm great,"
because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."
that come out of all this.
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence
and actually read it,
the phrase that sticks in many of our minds
is things about inalienable rights.
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,
oriented only by our values,
no other guidance.
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,
also known as King George.
We're great! Who is not great? England!"
Sorry. (Laughter)
What about Martin Luther King?
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."
Why did he do that? Because most people
are not at Stage Five.
About 25 percent are at Stage Two,
saying, in effect, "My life sucks."
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,
say, "I'm great and you're not."
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.
Only about 22 percent of tribes
are at Stage Four,
oriented by our values, saying "We're great.
And our values are beginning to unite us."
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes
get to Stage Five.
And those are the ones that change the world.
is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels
so that you can touch every person in society.
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.
So we have to have the ability to talk
all the levels, to go to where they are.
And then leaders nudge people
within their tribes to the next level.
I'd like to show you some examples of this.
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that
he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into
one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.
Now here is what happened to this person
who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.
He went from being alive and passionate
at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,
despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --
to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,
folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,
and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.
I don't know anybody.
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,
then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two
by getting them in a new tribe
and then, over time, getting them connected.
So, what about moving
from Stage Three to Stage Four?
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.
TED represents a set of values,
and as we unite around these values,
something really interesting begins to emerge.
as something historic,
then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something
beyond what people normally do
and call networking.
Which is not just to meet new people
and extend your reach, extend your influence,
but instead, find someone you don't know,
and find someone else you don't know,
and introduce them.
That's called a triadic relationship.
They extend the reach of their tribes
by connecting them, not just to myself,
so that my following is greater,
but I connect people who don't know each other
to something greater than themselves.
And ultimately that adds to their values.
which is great, to Stage Five?
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of
a place called the Gallup Organization.
You know they do polls, right?
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,
people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.
So, they were bored.
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.
instead of just polling what Asia thinks
or what the United States thinks,
or who thinks what about Obama
versus McCain or something like that,
what does the entire world think?"
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates
in economics, who reported being bored.
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper
and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population
of Sub-Saharan Africa?
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,
and speak languages we don't speak,
and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order
to achieve on this great mission,
we have to be able to do it.
Incidentally, they did pull it off.
And they released the first-ever world poll.
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.
You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach
of the tribes that you have.
But the question on the table is this:
What kind of an impact are the tribes
that you are in making?
You're hearing one presentation after another,
often representing a group of people, a tribe,
about how they have changed the world.
If you do what we've talked about, you listen
for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.
You remember to talk all five culture stages.
Because we've got people in all five, around us.
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:
Will your tribes change the world?
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
How do you feed a city?
It's one of the great questions of our time.
Yet it's one that's rarely asked.
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop
or restaurant, or indeed into this theater's foyer in about an hour's time,
there is going to be food there waiting for us,
having magically come from somewhere.
enough food has to be produced,
transported, bought and sold,
cooked, eaten, disposed of,
and that something similar has to happen every day
for every city on earth,
it's remarkable that cities get fed at all.
they're the most natural things in the world,
forgetting that because we're animals
and that we need to eat,
we're actually as dependent on the natural world
as our ancient ancestors were.
And as more of us move into cities,
more of that natural world is being
transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me --
it's soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil --
in order to feed us.
These are extraordinary landscapes,
but few of us ever get to see them.
are not just feeding us either.
As more of us move into cities,
more of us are eating meat,
so that a third of the annual grain crop globally
now gets fed to animals
rather than to us human animals.
And given that it takes three times as much grain --
actually ten times as much grain --
to feed a human if it's passed through an animal first,
that's not a very efficient way of feeding us.
By 2050, it's estimated that twice the number
of us are going to be living in cities.
And it's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much
meat and dairy consumed.
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand.
And that's going to pose an enormous problem.
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed,
by 2050.
That's a big problem. And actually if we carry on as we are,
it's a problem we're very unlikely to be able to solve.
to create new arable land.
Although at the same time we're losing an equivalent amount
of existing arables to salinization and erosion.
We're very hungry for fossil fuels too.
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie
of food that we consume in the West.
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost,
we don't actually value it.
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away.
And to end all of this, at the end of this long process,
we're not even managing to feed the planet properly.
A billion of us are obese, while a further billion starve.
None of it makes very much sense.
is controlled by just five multinational corporations,
it's a grim picture.
As we're moving into cities, the world is also embracing a Western diet.
And if we look to the future,
it's an unsustainable diet.
And more importantly, what are we going to do about it?
Well, to answer the slightly easier question first,
about 10,000 years ago, I would say,
is the beginning of this process
in the ancient Near East,
known as the Fertile Crescent.
Because, as you can see, it was crescent shaped.
And it was also fertile.
And it was here, about 10,000 years ago,
that two extraordinary inventions,
agriculture and urbanism, happened
roughly in the same place and at the same time.
because agriculture and cities are bound together. They need each other.
Because it was discovery of grain
by our ancient ancestors for the first time
that produced a food source that was large enough
and stable enough to support permanent settlements.
And if we look at what those settlements were like,
we see they were compact.
They were surrounded by productive farm land
and dominated by large temple complexes
like this one at Ur,
that were, in fact, effectively,
spiritualized, central food distribution centers.
gathered in the grain, offered it to the gods,
and then offered the grain that the gods didn't eat back to the people.
So, if you like,
the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities
was dominated by the grain and the harvest
that sustained them.
And in fact, that's true of every ancient city.
But of course not all of them were that small.
Famously, Rome had about a million citizens
by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself?
The answer is what I call "ancient food miles."
which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away.
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world,
because it was very difficult to transport food over roads,
which were rough.
And the food obviously went off very quickly.
So Rome effectively waged war
on places like Carthage and Egypt
just to get its paws on their grain reserves.
And, in fact, you could say that the expansion of the Empire
was really sort of one long, drawn out
militarized shopping spree, really.
(Laughter)
In fact -- I love the fact, I just have to mention this:
Rome in fact used to import oysters from London,
at one stage. I think that's extraordinary.
through its appetite.
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also
happened in the pre-industrial world.
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century,
we can see that its grain, which is coming in from the Thames,
along the bottom of this map.
So the grain markets were to the south of the city.
And the roads leading up from them
to Cheapside, which was the main market,
were also grain markets.
Bread Street, you can tell
what was going on there 300 years ago.
And the same of course was true for fish.
Fish was, of course, coming in by river as well. Same thing.
And of course Billingsgate, famously, was London's fish market,
operating on-site here until the mid-1980s.
Which is extraordinary, really, when you think about it.
Everybody else was wandering around
with mobile phones that looked like bricks
and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port.
Once its roots into the city are established,
they very rarely move.
Meat is a very different story
because, of course, animals could walk into the city.
So much of London's meat
was coming from the northwest,
from Scotland and Wales.
So it was coming in, and arriving at the city at the northwest,
which is why Smithfield,
London's very famous meat market, was located up there.
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on, to the northeast.
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this. Anyway,
and so the birds were coming in
with their feet protected with little canvas shoes.
And then when they hit the eastern end
of Cheapside, that's where they were sold,
which is why it's called Poultry.
built before the industrial age,
you can trace food coming in to it.
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food,
both by reading the names of the streets, which give you a lot of clues.
Friday Street, in a previous life,
is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday.
But also you have to imagine it full of food.
Because the streets and the public spaces
were the only places where food was bought and sold.
you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this
and be unaware of where your food came from.
In fact, if you were having Sunday lunch,
the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window
about three days earlier.
So this was obviously an organic city,
part of an organic cycle.
And then 10 years later everything changed.
And as you can see, some of the earliest train passengers
were pigs and sheep.
So all of a sudden, these animals are no longer walking into market.
They're being slaughtered out of sight and mind,
somewhere in the countryside.
And they're coming into the city by rail.
And this changes everything.
To start off with, it makes it possible
for the first time to grow cities,
really any size and shape, in any place.
Cities used to be constrained by geography;
they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means.
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography.
in the 90 years after the trains came,
it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed
by animals coming in on foot, and so on,
to a large splurge,
that would be very, very difficult to feed with anybody on foot,
either animals or people.
And of course that was just the beginning. After the trains came cars,
and really this marks the end of this process.
It's the final emancipation of the city
from any apparent relationship with nature at all.
devoid of mess, certainly devoid of people,
because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape.
In fact, what they did to get food was they got in their cars,
drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts,
came back with a week's worth of shopping,
and wondered what on earth to do with it.
And this really is the moment when our relationship,
both with food and cities, changes completely.
the social core of the city -- at the periphery.
It used to be a social event, buying and selling food.
Now it's anonymous.
We used to cook; now we just add water,
or a little bit of an egg if you're making a cake or something.
We don't smell food to see if it's okay to eat.
We just read the back of a label on a packet.
And we don't value food. We don't trust it.
So instead of trusting it, we fear it.
And instead of valuing it, we throw it away.
is that they've made the very thing they promised
to make easier much harder.
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place,
they've actually distanced us from our most important relationship,
which is that of us and nature.
And also they've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver,
that, as we've seen, are unsustainable.
It's not a new question.
500 years ago it's what Thomas More was asking himself.
This is the frontispiece of his book "Utopia."
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states,
if that sounds remotely familiar,
a day's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad,
and grew vegetables in their back gardens,
and ate communal meals together, and so on.
And I think you could argue that
food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia,
even though More never framed it that way.
that of Ebenezer Howard, "The Garden City."
Same idea: series of semi-independent city-states,
little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around,
joined to one another by railway.
And again, food could be said to be
the ordering principle of his vision.
It even got built, but nothing to do with
this vision that Howard had.
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas,
that they are Utopian.
It was a kind of joke, because it's got a double derivation from the Greek.
It can either mean a good place, or no place.
Because it's an ideal. It's an imaginary thing. We can't have it.
And I think, as a conceptual tool
for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling,
that makes it not much use.
So I've come up with an alternative,
which is Sitopia, from the ancient Greek,
"sitos" for food, and "topos" for place.
We live in a world shaped by food,
and if we realize that, we can use food as a really powerful tool --
a conceptual tool, design tool, to shape the world differently.
So if we were to do that, what might Sitopia look like?
Well I think it looks a bit like this.
I have to use this slide. It's just the look on the face of the dog.
But anyway, this is -- (Laughter)
it's food at the center of life,
at the center of family life, being celebrated,
being enjoyed, people taking time for it.
This is where food should be in our society.
By the way, these can be men as well.
It's people who think about food,
who think ahead, who plan,
who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables
and actually recognize them.
We need these people. We're part of a network.
Because without these kinds of people we can't have places like this.
Here, I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable.
But networks, markets where food is being grown locally.
It's common. It's fresh.
It's part of the social life of the city.
Because without that, you can't have this kind of place,
food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape,
and is not just a zero-sum commodity
off in some unseen hell-hole.
Cows with a view.
Steaming piles of humus.
This is basically bringing the whole thing together.
I visited recently in Toronto.
It's a greenhouse, where kids get told
all about food and growing their own food.
Here is a plant called Kevin, or maybe it's a
plant belonging to a kid called Kevin. I don't know.
But anyway, these kinds of projects
that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important.
It's basically recognizing that Sitopia
already exists in little pockets everywhere.
The trick is to join them up,
to use food as a way of seeing.
And if we do that, we're going to stop seeing cities
as big, metropolitan, unproductive blobs, like this.
We're going to see them more like this,
as part of the productive, organic framework
of which they are inevitably a part,
symbiotically connected.
But of course, that's not a great image either,
because we need not to be producing food like this anymore.
We need to be thinking more about permaculture,
which is why I think this image just
sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing.
It's a re-conceptualization
of the way food shapes our lives.
It's Ambrogio Lorenzetti's "Allegory of Good Government."
It's about the relationship between the city and the countryside.
And I think the message of this is very clear.
If the city looks after the country,
the country will look after the city.
And I want us to ask now,
what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint
if he painted this image today?
What would an allegory of good government look like today?
Because I think it's an urgent question.
It's one we have to ask,
and we have to start answering.
We know we are what we eat.
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat.
But if we take that idea, we can use food
as a really powerful tool to shape the world better.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I run a design studio in New York.
Every seven years, I close it for one year
to pursue
some little experiments, things that
are always difficult to accomplish
during the regular working year.
In that year, we are not available
for any of our clients.
We are totally closed.
And as you can imagine,
it is a lovely and very energetic time.
to combine my two loves, music and design.
And we created videos and packaging
for many musicians that you know,
and for even more that you've never heard of.
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life
that I actually love,
I adapt to it.
And I get, over time, bored by them.
And for sure, in our case,
our work started to look the same.
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged
in a book, in a die cut.
So I decided to close it down for one year.
right now we spend about
in the first 25 years of our lives learning,
then there is another 40 years
that's really reserved for working.
And then tacked on at the end of it
are about 15 years for retirement.
And I thought it might be helpful
to basically cut off five of those retirement years
and intersperse them in between those working years.
(Applause)
That's clearly enjoyable for myself.
But probably even more important is
that the work that comes out of these years
flows back into the company
and into society at large,
rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.
Jonathan Haidt,
who defined his work into three different levels.
And they rang very true for me.
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.
In a career I'm definitely more engaged.
But at the same time, there will be periods when I think
is all that really hard work really worth my while?
While in the third one, in the calling,
very much likely I would do it also
if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.
but I did look for nature.
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.
Looked for something different for the second one.
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing
because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia
were Sri Lanka and Bali.
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.
and pretty much started to work right away.
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.
However the first thing that I needed was
mosquito repellent typography
because they were definitely around heavily.
And then I needed some sort of way
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs
that surround my house,
and attacked me during my morning walks.
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.
Every single dog on one tee shirt.
As a little retaliation
with a just ever so slightly menacing message
(Laughter)
on the back of the shirt.
(Laughter)
I decided I could actually renovate my studio.
And then just leave it all to them.
And I don't have to do anything.
So I looked for furniture.
And it turned out that
all the furniture that I really liked,
I couldn't afford.
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali
was pieces of furniture.
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.
It's not quite finished yet.
And I think by the time this lamp came about,
(Laughter)
I had finally made peace with those dogs.
(Laughter)
It's called Be Here Now.
It includes 330 compasses.
And we had custom espresso cups made
that hide a magnet inside,
and make those compasses go crazy,
always centering on them.
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware
how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.
So I will not really go too far into it.
Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,
I got it through the TED book club.
I think it took me four years
to finally read it, while on sabbatical.
And I was pleased to see
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.
And I'll show you a couple of people
that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.
he is right now the best chef in the world
with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.
His restaurant is open seven months every year.
He closes it down for five months
to experiment with a full kitchen staff.
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.
He can seat, throughout the year,
he can seat 8,000 people.
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.
it's 12.5 percent of my time.
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,
3M since the 1930s
is giving all their engineers
15 percent to pursue whatever they want.
There is some good successes.
Scotch tape came out of this program,
as well as Art Fry developed
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.
Google, of course, very famously
gives 20 percent for their software engineers
to pursue their own personal projects.
That's about five percent of everybody.
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.
Talk to them about if it was successful or not.
I've found that
finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,
my very best way is to talk to people
who have actually done it
much better than myself envisioning it.
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.
(Laughter)
it was rather disastrous.
I had thought that I should do this without any plan,
that this vacuum of time somehow would
be wonderful and enticing
for idea generation. It was not.
I just, without a plan, I just reacted
to little requests, not work requests,
those I all said no to, but other little requests.
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.
So I became my own intern.
(Laughter)
made a list of the things I was interested in,
put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time
and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;
9 to 10: future thinking.
Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.
And that actually, specifically as a starting point
of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.
What came out of it?
I really got close to design again.
I had fun.
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.
basically everything we've done
in the seven years following the first sabbatical
came out of thinking of that one single year.
And I'll show you a couple of projects
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was
that sameness is so incredibly overrated.
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same
works for a very very few strand of companies,
and not for everybody else.
the Rem Koolhaas-built music center
in Porto, in Portugal.
And even though I desired to do an identity
that doesn't use the architecture,
I failed at that.
And mostly also because I realized
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.
Which I understood after I
translated it from architecture speech
in to regular English,
basically as logo making.
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.
We put a mask on it,
looked at it deep down in the ground,
checked it out from all sides,
west, north, south, east,
top and bottom.
Colored them in a very particular way
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,
the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.
That's connected to a scanner.
You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.
And the software, in a second,
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,
comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo
and the actual poster is exactly the same.
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,
who all performed there, get their own
Casa da Musica logo.
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.
There is a full-blown orchestra
living inside the building.
It has a more transparent identity.
The truck they go on tour with.
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,
12 people that remixes its own title.
was that you could take the logo type
and create advertising out of it.
Like this Donna Toney poster,
or Chopin, or Mozart,
or La Monte Young.
You can take the shape and make typography out of it.
You can grow it underneath the skin.
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,
or a rave underneath the house
or a weekly program,
as well as educational services.
been mostly involved
or used the language of design
for promotional purposes,
which was fine with me.
On one hand I have nothing against selling.
My parents are both salespeople.
But I did feel that
I spent so much time learning this language,
why do I only promote with it?
There must be something else.
And the whole series of work came out of it.
Some of you might have seen it.
I showed some of it
at earlier TEDs before,
under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."
I'll just show two now.
at different ripenesses
on the opening day in this gallery in New York.
It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."
This is after a week.
After two weeks,
three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.
And you see the self confidence almost comes back,
but not quite.
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.
(Laughter)
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.
We used the stone plates as a grid
for our little piece.
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,
at different darknesses.
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,
medium ones, and very old, dark ones.
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,
created this fairly floral typography
that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse
and my work better."
make the type so precious
that as an audience
you would be in between,
"Should I really take as much money as I can?
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"
While we built all this up
during that week, with the 100 volunteers,
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza
got very close to it and quite loved it.
So when it was finally done,
and in the first night
a guy came with big plastic bags
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,
one of the neighbors called the police.
in all their wisdom,
came, saw,
and they wanted to protect the artwork.
And they swept it all up and put it into custody
at police headquarters.
(Laughter)
I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.
That's the police, getting rid of it all.
So after eight hours
that's pretty much all that was left
of the whole thing.
(Laughter)
It's a movie about happiness.
And here we asked some nearby pigs
to do the titles for us.
They weren't quite slick enough.
So we asked the goose to do it again,
and hoped she would do somehow,
a more elegant or pretty job.
And I think she overdid it.
Just a bit too ornamental.
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.
And the monkeys in that monkey forest
looked, actually, fairly happy.
So we asked those guys to do it again.
They did a fine job, but had
a couple of readability problems.
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself
doesn't really get done properly.
So it's going to be a while.
And of course you might think that
doing a film on happiness
might not really be worthwhile.
Then you can of course always
go and see this guy.
And I'm happy I'm alive.
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.
(Applause)
I have a very difficult task.
I'm a spectroscopist.
I have to talk about astronomy without showing you
any single image of nebulae or galaxies, etc.
because my job is spectroscopy.
I never deal with images.
But I'll try to convince you
that spectroscopy is actually something which can
change this world.
Spectroscopy can probably answer the question,
"Is there anybody out there?"
Are we alone? SETI.
It's not very fun to do spectroscopy.
Nevena Markova, spent about 20 years
studying these profiles.
And she published 42 articles
just dedicated to the subject.
Can you imagine? Day and night, thinking,
observing, the same star for 20 years
is incredible.
But we are crazy. We do these things.
(Laughter)
I spent about eight months working on these profiles.
Because I've noticed
a very small symmetry
in the profile of one of the planet host stars.
And I thought, well maybe there is Lithium-6 in this star,
which is an indication that this star
has swallowed a planet.
Because apparently you can't have this fragile isotope
of Lithium-6 in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
But you have it in planets and asteroids.
So if you engulf planet or large number of asteroids,
you will have this Lithium-6 isotope
in the spectrum of the star.
So I invested more than eight months
just studying the profile of this star.
because I got phone calls from many reporters asking,
"Have you actually seen the planet going into a star?"
Because they thought that if you are having a telescope,
you are an astronomer so what you are doing
is actually looking in a telescope.
And you might have seen the planet going into a star.
And I was saying, "No, excuse me.
What I see is this one."
(Laughter)
It's just incredible. Because nobody understood really.
I bet that there were very few people
who really understood what I'm talking about.
Because this is the indication that the planet went into the star.
It's amazing.
was actually realized
by Pink Floyd already in 1973.
(Laughter)
Because they actually said that
you can get any color you like
in a spectrum.
And all you need is time and money
to make your spectrograph.
This is the number one high resolution,
most precise spectrograph on this planet, called HARPS,
which is actually used to detect
extrasolar planets and sound waves
in the atmospheres of stars.
I'm sure most of you know from school physics
that it's basically splitting a white light
into colors.
And if you have a liquid hot mass,
it will produce something which we call a continuous spectrum.
A hot gas is producing emission lines only,
no continuum.
And if you place a cool gas in front of a
hot source,
you will see certain patterns
which we call absorption lines.
Which is used actually to identify chemical elements
in a cool matter,
which is absorbing exactly at those frequencies.
We can actually study line-of-sight velocities
of cosmic objects.
And we can also study chemical composition
and physical parameters of stars,
galaxies, nebulae.
A star is the most simple object.
In the core, we have thermonuclear reactions going on,
creating chemical elements.
And we have a cool atmosphere.
It's cool for me.
Cool in my terms is three or four or five thousand degrees.
My colleagues in infra-red astronomy
call minus 200 Kelvin is cool for them.
But you know, everything is relative.
So for me 5,000 degrees is pretty cool.
(Laughter)
24,000 spectral lines,
and about 15 percent of these lines is not yet identified.
It is amazing. So we are in the 21st century,
and we still cannot properly understand
the spectrum of the sun.
Sometimes we have to deal with
just one tiny, weak spectral line
to measure the composition of that chemical element in the atmosphere.
For instance, you see the spectral line of the gold
is the only spectral line in the spectrum of the Sun.
And we use this weak feature
to measure the composition
of gold in the atmosphere of the Sun.
We have been dealing with a similarly very weak feature,
which belongs to osmium.
It's a heavy element produced in thermonuclear
explosions of supernovae.
It's the only place where you can produce, actually, osmium.
Just comparing the composition of osmium
in one of the planet host stars,
we want to understand why there is so much
of this element.
Perhaps we even think that maybe
supernova explosions trigger formations of planets and stars.
It can be an indication.
Gibor Basri, emailed me
a very interesting spectrum,
asking me, "Can you have a look at this?"
And I couldn't sleep, next two weeks,
when I saw the huge amount of oxygen
It was incredible. The only conclusion we could make from this
is clear evidence that there was a supernova explosion
in this system, which polluted the atmosphere
of this star.
And later a black hole was formed
in a binary system,
which is still there with a mass of about
five solar masses.
This was considered as first evidence that actually black holes
come from supernovae explosions.
in different galactic stars,
actually discovered alien stars in our galaxy.
It's amazing that you can go so far
simply studying the chemical composition of stars.
They actually said that one of the stars you see in the spectra
is an alien. It comes from a different galaxy.
There is interaction of galaxies. We know this.
And sometimes they just capture stars.
We were very surprised to discover
a super flare,
a flare which is thousands of millions of times
more powerful than those we see in the Sun.
In one of the binary stars in our galaxy
called FH Leo,
we discovered the super flare.
And later we went to study the spectral stars
to see is there anything strange with these objects.
And we found that everything is normal.
These stars are normal like the Sun. Age, everything was normal.
So this is a mystery.
It's one of the mysteries we still have, super flares.
And there are six or seven similar cases
reported in the literature.
we really need to understand chemical evolution of the universe.
It's very complicated. I don't really want you to
try to understand what is here.
(Laughter)
But it's to show you how complicated is the whole story
of the production of chemical elements.
You have two channels --
the massive stars and low-mass stars --
producing and recycling matter and chemical elements in the universe.
And doing this for 14 billion years,
we end up with this picture,
which is a very important graph,
showing relative abundances of chemical elements
in sun-like stars
and in the interstellar medium.
to find an object where you find about 10 times more sulfur than silicon,
five times more calcium than oxygen. It's just impossible.
And if you find one, I will say that
this is something related to SETI,
because naturally you can't do it.
Doppler Effect is something very important
from fundamental physics.
And this is related to the change of the frequency
of a moving source.
The Doppler Effect is used to discover extrasolar planets.
to discover a Jupiter-like planet
around a sun-like star
is something like 28.4 meters per second.
And we need nine centimeters per second
to detect an Earth-like planet.
This can be done with the future spectrographs.
I, myself, I'm actually involved in the team
which is developing a CODEX,
And this is going to be an instrument
to detect Earth-like planets
around sun-like stars.
It is an amazing tool called astroseismology
where we can detect sound waves
in the atmospheres of stars.
We can detect sound waves
in the atmospheres of sun-like stars.
Those waves have frequencies
in infrasound domain, the sound actually nobody knows, domain.
Coming back to the most important question,
"Is there anybody out there?"
This is closely related
to tectonic and volcanic activity of planets.
Connection between life
and radioactive nuclei
is straightforward.
No life without tectonic activity,
without volcanic activity.
And we know very well that geothermal energy
is mostly produced by decay of uranium, thorium, and potassium.
where the amount of those elements is small,
so those planets are tectonically dead,
there cannot be life.
If there is too much uranium or potassium or thorium,
probably, again, there would be no life.
Because can you imagine everything boiling?
It's too much energy on a planet.
Now, we have been measuring abundance
of thorium in one of the stars with extrasolar planets.
It's exactly the same game. A very tiny feature.
and to detect thorium.
It's very tough. It's very tough.
And you have to, first you have to convince yourself.
Then you have to convince your colleagues.
And then you have to convince the whole world
that you have actually detected something like this
in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet
host star somewhere in 100 parsec away from here.
It's really difficult.
But if you want to know about a life on extrasolar planets,
you have to do this job.
Because you have to know how much of radioactive element you have
in those systems.
is to tune your radio telescope and listen to the signals.
If you receive something interesting,
well that's what SETI does actually,
what SETI has been doing for many years.
I think the most promising way
is to go for biomarkers.
You can see the spectrum of the Earth, this Earthshine spectrum,
and that is a very clear signal.
The slope which is coming, which we call a Red Edge,
is a detection of vegetated area.
It's amazing that we can detect vegetation
from a spectrum.
Now imagine doing this test
for other planets.
I'm talking about last six, seven, eight months,
water, methane, carbon dioxide
have been detected in the spectrum
of a planet outside the solar system.
It's amazing. So this is the power of spectroscopy.
You can actually go and detect
and study a chemical composition of planets
far, far, far from solar system.
We have to detect oxygen or ozone
to make sure that we have all necessary conditions
to have life.
which can be related to SETI.
Now imagine an object, amazing object,
or something which we cannot explain
when we just stand up and say,
"Look, we give up. Physics doesn't work."
So it's something which you can always refer to SETI and say,
"Well, somebody must be doing this, somehow."
it's something actually which has been pointed out
by Frank Drake,
many years ago, and Shklovsky.
If you see, in the spectrum of a planet host star,
if you see strange chemical elements,
it can be a signal from a civilization
which is there and they want to signal about it.
They want to actually signal their presence
through these spectral lines,
in the spectrum of a star, in different ways.
One is, for instance, technetium
is a radioactive element
with a decay time of 4.2 million years.
If you suddenly observe technetium
in a sun-like star,
you can be sure that somebody has put this
element in the atmosphere,
because in a natural way it is impossible to do this.
Now we are reviewing the spectra of about
300 stars with extrasolar planets.
And we are doing this job since 2000
and it's a very heavy project.
We have been working very hard.
And we have some interesting cases,
candidates, so on, things which we can't really explain.
And I hope in the near future
we can confirm this.
I think it will not come from UFOs.
It will not come from radio signals.
I think it will come from a spectrum like this.
It is the spectrum of a planet like Earth,
showing a presence of nitrogen dioxide,
as a clear signal of life,
and oxygen and ozone.
If, one day, and I think it will be
within 15 years from now, or 20 years.
If we discover a spectrum like this
we can be sure that there is life on that planet.
In about five years we will discover
planets like Earth, around sun-like stars,
the same distance as the Earth from the Sun.
It will take about five years.
And then we will need another 10, 15 years
with space projects
to get the spectra of Earth-like planets like the one I showed you.
And if we see the nitrogen dioxide
and oxygen,
I think we have the perfect E.T.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
For years I've been feeling frustrated,
because as a religious historian,
I've become acutely aware
of the centrality of compassion
in all the major world faiths.
Every single one of them
has evolved their own version
of what's been called the Golden Rule.
Sometimes it comes in a positive version --
"Always treat all others as you'd like to be treated yourself."
And equally important
is the negative version --
"Don't do to others what you would not like them to do to you."
Look into your own heart,
discover what it is that gives you pain
and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever,
to inflict that pain on anybody else.
not just because it sounds good,
but because it works.
People have found that when they have
implemented the Golden Rule
as Confucius said, "all day and every day,"
not just a question of doing your good deed for the day
and then returning to a life of greed
and egotism,
but to do it all day and every day,
you dethrone yourself from the center of your world,
put another there, and you transcend yourself.
And it brings you into the presence
of what's been called God, Nirvana, Rama, Tao.
Something that goes beyond
what we know in our ego-bound existence.
that this was so central to the religious life.
Because with a few wonderful exceptions,
very often when religious people come together,
religious leaders come together, they're arguing about abstruse doctrines
or uttering a council of hatred
or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort.
Often people don't really want to be compassionate.
I sometimes see
when I'm speaking to a congregation of religious people
a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces
because people often want to be right instead.
And that of course defeats the object of the exercise.
Because they took me very gently
from my book-lined study
and brought me into the 21st century,
enabling me to speak to a much, much wider audience
than I could have ever conceived.
Because I feel an urgency about this.
If we don't manage to implement
the Golden Rule globally,
so that we treat all peoples, wherever and whoever they may be,
as though they were as important as ourselves,
I doubt that we'll have
a viable world to hand on to the next generation.
one of the great tasks of our time,
is to build a global society, as I said,
where people can live together in peace.
And the religions that should be making a major contribution
are instead seen as part of the problem.
And of course it's not just religious people who believe in the Golden Rule.
This is the source of all morality,
this imaginative act of empathy,
putting yourself in the place of another.
We can either go on bringing out or emphasizing
the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith,
or we can go back to
the rabbis. Rabbi Hillel, the older contemporary of Jesus,
who, when asked by a pagan
to sum up the whole of Jewish teaching while he stood on one leg,
said, "That which is hateful to you, do not do to your neighbor.
That is the Torah and everything else is only commentary."
any interpretation of scripture
that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate.
And we need to revive that spirit.
And it's not just going to happen
because a spirit of love wafts us down.
We have to make this happen,
and we can do it
with the modern communications
that TED has introduced.
Already I've been tremendously heartened
at the response of all our partners.
going to use the Charter to heal divisions
recently that have sprung up in Singaporean society,
and some members of the parliament want
to implement it politically.
In Malaysia, there is going to be an art exhibition
in which leading artists are going to be
taking people, young people,
and showing them that compassion also lies
at the root of all art.
Throughout Europe, the Muslim communities
are holding events and discussions,
are discussing the centrality of compassion
in Islam and in all faiths.
Religious teaching, this is where we've gone so wrong,
concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines.
Religious teaching must always lead to action.
And I intend to work on this till my dying day.
And I want to continue with our partners
to do two things --
educate and stimulate compassionate thinking.
Education because we've so
dropped out of compassion.
People often think it simply means
feeling sorry for somebody.
But of course you don't understand compassion
if you're just going to think about it.
You also have to do it.
because the media are crucial
in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views
we have of other people,
which are dividing us from one another.
The same applies to educators.
I'd like youth to get a sense of
the dynamism, the dynamic and challenge
of a compassionate lifestyle.
And also see that it demands acute intelligence,
not just a gooey feeling.
the compassionate theme
in their own and in other people's traditions.
And perhaps above all,
to encourage a sensitivity about
uncompassionate speaking,
so that because people have this Charter,
whatever their beliefs or lack of them,
they feel empowered
to challenge uncompassionate speech,
disdainful remarks
from their religious leaders, their political leaders,
from the captains of industry.
Because we can change the world,
we have the ability.
I was still stuck in the old world
of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room
and issuing yet another arcane statement.
And TED introduced me to a whole new way
of thinking and presenting ideas.
Because that is what is so wonderful about TED.
In this room, all this expertise,
if we joined it all together,
we could change the world.
And of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable.
with a reference to a British author, an Oxford author
whom I don't quote very often,
C.S. Lewis.
But he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind
ever since I read it when I was a schoolgirl.
It's in his book "The Four Loves."
He said that he distinguished between erotic love,
when two people gaze, spellbound, into each other's eyes.
And then he compared that to friendship,
when two people stand side by side, as it were, shoulder to shoulder,
with their eyes fixed on a common goal.
but we can become friends.
And I am convinced.
I felt it very strongly
during our little deliberations at Vevey,
that when people of all different persuasions
come together, working side by side
for a common goal,
differences melt away.
And we learn amity.
And we learn to live together and to get to know one another.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
I'd like to talk a little bit this morning
about what happens if we move from design
to design thinking.
Now this rather old photo up there
is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,
something like 25 years ago.
It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,
and my task was to
make this thing a little bit more modern,
a little bit easier to use.
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.
Unfortunately, not very long afterwards
the company went out of business.
I put an attractive shell around some new technology.
Again, 18 months later,
the product was obsolete.
And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.
Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,
but eventually it occurred to me that
maybe what passed for design
wasn't all that important --
making things more attractive,
making them a bit easier to use,
making them more marketable.
By focusing on a design,
maybe just a single product,
I was being incremental
and not having much of an impact.
is a relatively recent phenomenon,
and in fact really emerged
in the latter half of the 20th century
as design became a tool of consumerism.
So when we talk about design today,
and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,
we're often talking about products like these.
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.
Important? Not so very.
And I'd like to suggest that if we take
a different view of design,
and focus less on the object
and more on design thinking as an approach,
designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,
including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol
and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.
Both great designs and actually very innovative too.
His greatest creation
runs actually right through here in Oxford.
It's called the Great Western Railway.
and one of my favorite things to do
was to cycle along by the side of the railway
waiting for the great big express trains to roar past.
You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,
"Rain, Steam and Speed".
Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers
was the experience of floating across the countryside.
And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients
that had ever yet been made,
which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --
this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --
with just trying to design the best railway journey.
He imagined an integrated transportation system
in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark
on a train in London
and disembark from a ship in New York.
One journey from London to New York.
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built
to take care of the second half of that journey.
the emergence of the design profession,
but I think he was using design thinking
to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,
the business school professor at the University of Toronto,
calls integrative thinking.
And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas
and opposing constraints
to create new solutions.
In the case of design, that means
balancing desirability, what humans need,
with technical feasibility,
and economic viability.
With innovations like the Great Western,
we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,
to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses
working on small things.
As our industrial society matured,
so design became a profession
and it focused on an ever smaller canvas
until it came to stand for aesthetics,
image and fashion.
Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.
I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,
and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.
There we go.
But I do think that perhaps design
is getting big again.
And that's happening through
the application of design thinking
to new kinds of problems --
to global warming, to education,
healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.
and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,
there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.
And I'd like to talk about some of those
just for the next few minutes.
The first of those is that design is
human-centered.
It may integrate technology and economics,
but it starts with what humans need, or might need.
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?
What makes technology useful and usable?
It's often about understanding culture and context
before we even know where to start to have ideas.
they wanted to understand what the aspirations
and motivations were of these school children
to understand how they might play a role
in screening their parents.
Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,
ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid
for the developing world.
Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians
to fit these hearing aids.
In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.
So it took a team working in India
with patients and community health workers
might replace those technicians
in a fitting and diagnostic service.
the team started with people and culture.
So if human need is the place to start,
then design thinking rapidly moves on to
learning by making.
Instead of thinking about what to build,
building in order to think.
Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world
the faster our ideas evolve.
the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.
They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients
by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay
to cross-subsidize those who cannot.
Now, they are very efficient,
but they are also very innovative.
When I visited them a few years ago,
what really impressed me was their willingness
to prototype their ideas very early.
for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.
They make their own intraocular lenses.
These are the lenses that replace those
that are damaged by cataracts.
And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality
that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.
Because they brought the cost down
from $200 a pair,
down to just $4 a pair.
Partly they did this by instead of building
a fancy new factory,
they used the basement of one of their hospitals.
And instead of installing the large-scale machines
used by western producers,
they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.
They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world
and have recently moved into a custom factory.
and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,
then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,
design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --
the shift from a passive relationship
between consumer and producer
to the active engagement of everyone
in experiences that are meaningful,
productive and profitable.
this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,
and take that a little bit further and say that
I think the design of participatory systems,
in which many more forms of value
beyond simply cash
are both created and measured,
is going to be the major theme, not only for design,
but also for our economy as we go forward.
created what became Britain's welfare state
in which he hoped that every citizen
would be an active participant
in their own social well-being.
By the time he wrote his third report,
he confessed that he had failed
and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.
and Hugo Manassei of Participle
have taken this idea of participation,
and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,
they are suggesting a framework
for reinventing the welfare state.
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,
they worked with residents in Southwark, South London
and a small team of designers
to develop a new membership organization
to help the elderly with household tasks.
Designs were refined and developed
with 150 older people and their families
before the service was launched earlier this year.
perhaps to its logical conclusion
and say that design may have its greatest impact
when it's taken out of the hands of designers
and put into the hands of everyone.
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system
Kaiser Permanente
study the topic of improving the patient experience,
and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge
and change shift.
Through a program of observational research,
brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,
they've developed a completely new way to change shift.
to discuss the various states and needs of patients,
to developing a system that happened on the ward
in front of patients, using a simple software tool.
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.
When you multiply that by all the nurses
in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,
it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.
of opportunities in healthcare alone.
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas
around design thinking
and some of the new kinds of projects
that they're being applied to.
But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,
and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,
and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.
And that connection is change.
In times of change we need
new alternatives, new ideas.
when all of life and our economy
was being reinvented.
Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,
and indeed they are part of the problem today.
But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.
And that change is forcing us to question
quite fundamental aspects of our society --
how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,
how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.
And in these times of change, we need these new choices
because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.
Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach
where we make the best choice out of available alternatives,
it encourages us to take a divergent approach,
to explore new alternatives, new solutions,
new ideas that have not existed before.
But before we go through that process of divergence,
there is actually quite an important first step.
And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?
What's the design brief?
Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,
"How do I take a train from London to New York?"
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?
And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,
in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
How might we improve access to safe drinking water
for the world's poorest people,
and at the same time stimulate innovation
amongst local water providers?
come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,
we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.
We teamed designers and investment experts up with
11 water organizations across India.
And through workshops they developed
innovative new products, services, and business models.
and then funded five of those organizations
to develop their ideas.
So they developed and iterated these ideas.
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them
to help design new social marketing campaigns,
community outreach strategies, business models,
new water vessels for storing water
And the same process is just getting underway
with NGOs in East Africa.
kind of how far we can go from
some of those sort of small things
that I was working on
at the beginning of my career.
That by focusing on the needs of humans
and by using prototypes
to move ideas along quickly,
by getting the process out of the hands of designers,
and by getting the active participation of the community,
we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,
we can have a bigger impact.
So that's one thing that we've been working on.
to know what this community thinks we could work on.
What kinds of questions do we think
design thinking could be used to tackle?
And if you've got any ideas
And the list looked something like this a little while ago.
And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in
by using the same hash code.
actually can make a difference,
that it can help create new ideas
and new innovations,
beyond the latest High Street products.
To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,
more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.
And the first step is to start asking the right questions.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Do we live in a borderless world?
Before you answer that, have a look at this map.
Contemporary political map shows
that we have over 200 countries in the world today.
That's probably more than at any time in centuries.
Now, many of you will object.
For you this would be a more appropriate map.
You could call it TEDistan.
In TEDistan, there are no borders,
just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.
Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots
on this screen, of the many more
that represent 90 percent of the world economy.
that will never leave the place in which they were born.
For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,
and often violently.
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great
riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:
our basic political geography.
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?
justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.
Border conflicts can derail
so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.
So I think we need a deeper understanding
of how people, money, power,
religion, culture, technology
interact to change the map of the world.
And we can try to anticipate those changes,
and shape them in a more constructive direction.
the present and some maps you haven't seen
in order to get a sense of where things are going.
Let's start with the world of 1945.
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.
After World War II, Europe was devastated,
but still held large overseas colonies:
French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.
Then over the late '40s,
'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,
waves of decolonization took place.
Over 50 new countries were born.
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.
Then came the end of the Cold War.
The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.
You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,
the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,
and the 'stans of central Asia.
The entire planet is covered
by sovereign, independent nation-states.
Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?
Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,
Eastern Eurasia.
As you can see on this map,
Russia is still the largest country in the world.
And as you know, China is the most populous.
And they share a lengthy land border.
is that most of Russia's 150 million people
are concentrated in its western provinces
and areas that are close to Europe.
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.
In fact, the World Bank predicts
that Russia's population is declining
towards about 120 million people
Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders
forced Russians out to the far east
to be in gulags, labor camps,
nuclear cities, whatever the case was.
But as oil prices rose,
Russian governments have invested in infrastructure
to unite the country, east and west.
But nothing has more perversely impacted
Russia's demographic distribution,
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,
have gotten on those trains and roads
and gone back to the west.
As a result, in the Russian far east today,
which is twice the size of India,
you have exactly six million Russians.
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.
Why do they call it that?
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate
and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --
and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.
China isn't conquering Mongolia.
It's buying it.
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.
Siberia most of you probably think of
as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.
But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,
all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields
and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.
But who is it going to feed?
Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,
in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,
you have over 100 million people.
That's larger than the entire population of Russia.
[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,
crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.
They've taken over the timber industry
and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.
Again, like Mongolia,
China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.
might look like in 10 to 20 years.
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,
led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,
but it does rhyme.
Again, globalization Chinese style.
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to
undermine and change the way we think about political geography.
So, the history of East Asia in fact,
people don't think about nations and borders.
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,
usually Chinese or Japanese.
So let's look at how China is re-establishing
that hierarchy in the far East.
It starts with the global hubs.
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map
that show the hubs of the global economy?
East Asia today has more of those global hubs
than any other region in the world.
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.
These are the filters and funnels of global capital.
Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,
so much of it being invested into China.
These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger
trade relationships that China has
with every country in the region.
Specifically, it targets Japan
and Korea and Australia,
countries that are strong allies of the United States.
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent
on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.
For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs
so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply
and become dependent on exporting to China as well.
how people are looking to China
to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.
The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging
now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.
It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions
such as the East Asian Community.
Some of these organizations don't even have
the United States as a member.
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,
such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,
most countries vow to just sit it out,
including American allies like Korea and Australia.
like Russia, is demographic.
China exports business people, nannies, students,
teachers to teach Chinese around the region,
to intermarry and to occupy ever greater
commanding heights of the economies.
Already ethnic Chinese people
in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia
are the real key factors and drivers
in the economies there.
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region
as a result.
Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.
Now it encourages it.
Well, if you remember before World War II,
Japan had a vision
for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.
What's emerging today is what you might call
a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.
So no matter what the lines on the map tell you
in terms of nations and borders,
what you really have emerging in the far east
are national cultures,
but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.
All of this is happening without firing a shot.
where countries are still very uncomfortable
in the borders left behind by European colonialists.
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?
What lines on the map should we focus on?
What I want to present to you is what I call
state building, day by day.
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,
the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;
now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.
The reason is Kurdistan.
The Kurds for 3,000 years
have been waging a struggle for independence,
and now is their chance to finally have it.
These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,
which is an oil-rich region.
you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas
are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.
But what are they guarding?
Is it really a border on the map?
No. It's the pipelines.
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms
of their own statehood.
Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?
I don't believe we should.
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,
behind Saudi Arabia.
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.
It has no choice but to behave.
In order to profit from its oil
it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,
and other countries, and Iraq itself.
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.
That is, of course, in Palestine.
Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly
because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.
30 years of rose garden diplomacy
have not delivered us peace in this conflict.
What might? I believe that what might
solve the problem is infrastructure.
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.
These two arrows are an arc,
an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure
that link the West Bank and Gaza.
and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,
Palestinian economy.
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine
is that independence alone, without infrastructure,
is futile.
if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,
when the insecurities might abate?
The last time that was the case was actually
a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.
This is the Hejaz Railway.
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.
It even had an offshoot running to Haifa
in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.
If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,
infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,
I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.
the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense.
He wanted ethnicities to mingle
in ways that would allow him to divide and rule.
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources
were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil
and the way we're talking about it now.
Before it was, how do we control their oil?
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them
as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.
Here are just some of the pipeline projections
and possibilities and scenarios
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.
A great deal of them.
having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy
and for having some meaning
besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.
Just take Azerbaijan.
Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,
but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,
it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.
as a frozen basket case.
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea
to provide for Europe,
and even a potentially Turkmen-
Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.
Today most people recognize Kazakhstan
as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,
north through Russia, and even east to China.
More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.
The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,
and the less of a dominant Great Game competition
we'll have in the 21st century.
and how that has enhanced its strength.
And that is, of course, Europe.
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany
to happen in a peaceful way.
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,
and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.
The E.U. also became a currency block,
and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year
since the end of the Cold War.
In fact most of that happened on just one day.
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.
and now you have what most people consider
a zone of peace spanning 27 countries
and 450 million people.
Well in light blue, you see the zones
or the regions that are at least two-thirds
or more dependent on the European Union
for trade and investment.
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us
that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,
they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia
Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.
But you can get on a German ICE train
and make it almost to Albania.
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,
and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.
On average, every year or two,
a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,
connecting North Africa to Europe.
That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance
on Russia for energy,
but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying
that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.
So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France
is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.
I mentioned Azerbaijan before.
That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus
has become the conduit for 20 percent
of Europe's energy supply.
So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?
I don't think it does. I think it's already part of
a Euro-Turkish superpower.
and new countries born?
Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia
is a very good place to start.
Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan
there is still a tremendous amount of instability.
Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile
that neither of them have dealt constructively
with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.
This is the flag that flies in the minds
of 20 million Pashtuns
who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.
Balochistan. Two weeks ago,
Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,
and this was the flag that they raised over it.
The post-colonial entropy
that is happening around the world is accelerating,
and I expect more such changes to occur in the map
as the states fragment.
53 countries, and by far the most number
of suspiciously straight lines on the map.
If we were to look at all of Africa
we could most certainly acknowledge far more,
tribal divisions and so forth.
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.
It has three ongoing civil wars,
the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,
the civil war in the east of the country,
and south Sudan.
South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011
in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.
There is a great race on for energy resources
under the Arctic seabed.
Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?
Actually Greenland.
Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people
voted themselves self-governance rights
from Denmark.
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.
It's constantly morphing and changing the world,
like climate change.
And like our relationship with the ecosystem
we're always searching for equilibrium
in how we divide ourselves across the planet.
Now we fear changes on the map.
We fear civil wars, death tolls,
having to learn the names of new countries.
But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today
is far worse and far more violent.
and what lines do we focus on?
I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,
the infrastructure lines.
Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.
Thank you.
(Applause)
and the aid system is failing us,
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.
Because of the resources, the skills,
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,
with the mindset to create change.
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.
must consider yourself a global soul,
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.
And no matter what country you live or work in,
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,
even in their most ordinariness.
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,
how best we release their energies.
On the one hand, we have people that say
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.
And on the other we have people who say
the problem is that we need more aid.
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.
We call it patient capital.
in Africa since 1970
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation
and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?
They use Mobutu as metaphor.
And their policy prescription is to
make government more accountable,
focus on the capital markets,
invest, don't give anything away.
the problem is that we need more money.
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out
and we'll hand a lot of aid,
but when it comes to our poor brethren,
we want little to do with it.
They point to the successes of aid:
the eradication of smallpox,
and the distribution of tens of millions
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.
Both sides are right.
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.
Even more problematic, they're not listening to
poor people themselves.
poverty and innovation,
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented
individuals on the planet
than low-income people.
They must navigate markets daily,
making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,
to move their way through society,
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem
impacts their family,
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.
And so we need both the market
and we need aid.
and tries to take the best of both.
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities
and are building solutions
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.
incredible tolerance for risk,
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those
entrepreneurs time to experiment,
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,
and the expectation of below-market returns,
but outsized social impact.
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,
and so patient capital also works
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy
to include all people.
for three reasons.
First, they tend to work in markets
where people make one, two, three dollars a day
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.
Second, the geographies in which they work
have terrible infrastructure --
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity
and high levels of corruption.
Third, they are often creating markets.
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.
And so many low-income people
have seen so many failed promises broken
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them
that building trust takes a lot of time,
takes a lot of patience.
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.
Not only to build the systems,
the business models that allow us
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,
but to connect those business
to other markets, to governments, to corporations --
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.
about an innovation called drip irrigation.
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur
named Amitabha Sadangi from India,
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.
And he was expressing his frustration
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,
despite the fact that 200 million farmers
alone in India make under a dollar a day.
They were creating subsidies
either for large farms,
or they were giving inputs to the farmers
that they thought they should use, rather than
that the farmers wanted to use.
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology
that had been invented in Israel.
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water
directly to the stalk of the plant.
And it could transform
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,
because these systems were both too expensive,
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.
The average small village farmer
works on two acres or less.
and he would redesign it from the perspective
of the poor farmers themselves,
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed
not what he thought that they should have.
And he used three fundamental principles.
The drip irrigation system
had to be small enough that a farmer only had
to risk a quarter acre,
even if he had two,
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,
or else they wouldn't take the risk.
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls
infinitely expandable.
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,
the farmers could buy a second
and a third and a fourth.
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems
and has seen their yields and incomes
double or triple on average,
but this didn't happen overnight.
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,
there were no private investors
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.
to research, to experiment, to fail,
to innovate and try again.
And when he had a prototype
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,
that's when patient capital could come in.
And we helped him build a company, for profit,
that would build on IDE's knowledge,
and start looking at sales and exports,
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.
And while, again, you needed patience
to move a technology for the poor
in India into Pakistan,
just to get the permits,
over time we were able to start a company
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large
community development organization in the Thar Desert,
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.
And though that company has just started,
our assumption is that there too
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing
has worked in partnership with us,
with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,
to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets
for Africans around the world.
is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India
to bring quality, affordable maternal health care
to low-income women,
and it's been so successful that it's currently building
a new hospital every 35 days.
reinvent a completely broken industry,
building an ambulance service in Bombay
that would use the technology of Google Earth,
a sliding scale pricing system
so that all people could have access,
and a severe and public decision
not to engage in any form of corruption.
So that in the terrorist attacks of November
they were the first responder,
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies
in India.
Because we're starting to see these enterprises
reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed
have reached at least a quarter million people.
But that's obviously not enough.
And it's where the idea of partnership
becomes so important.
Whether it's by finding those innovations
that can access the capital markets,
government itself, or partner with major corporations,
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.
And I would submit that it's time to consider
a global innovation fund
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world
who really have innovations, not only for their country,
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.
And then measure the returns,
both from a financial perspective
and from a social impact perspective.
We've had a rocky relationship with that country
and, in all fairness,
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.
But again I would say that this is our moment
for extraordinary things to happen.
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,
we could use this time to invest
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,
nor in international experts,
but in the many existing entrepreneurs
and civil society leaders
who already are building wonderful innovations
that are reaching people all across the country.
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way
called incremental housing,
where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers
into safe, affordable community housing.
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation
that are building schools across the country.
It's not hyperbole
to say that these civil society institutions
and these social entrepreneurs
are building real alternatives to the Taliban.
and those of you who've also worked there
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.
those who make peaceful revolution impossible
make violent revolution inevitable.
I would say that the converse is true.
That these social leaders
who really are looking at innovation
and extending opportunity
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,
provide real pathways to hope.
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,
while we need to strengthen the judiciary,
build greater stability,
we also need to think about lifting those leaders
who can be role models for the rest of the world.
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.
It was about 115 degrees.
And we drove for eight hours
along this moonscape-like landscape
with very little color, lots of heat,
very little discussion, because we were exhausted.
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.
That there in the desert
was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth
had gotten access to a technology
that had allowed him to change his own life.
His name was Raja,
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes
and warm expressive hands
that reminded me of my father.
in his entire life that he hadn't taken
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren
on a two day journey across the desert
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm
for about 50 cents a day.
Because he was building these crops.
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.
And for the first time ever in three generations,
his children would go to school.
And he said, "Of course I will.
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."
When we think about solutions to poverty,
we cannot deny individuals
their fundamental dignity.
Because at the end of the day,
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors
who are building innovations that recognize
that what people want is freedom
and choice and opportunity.
Because that is where dignity really starts.
love without power is anemic and sentimental,
and that power without love
is reckless and abusive.
Our generation has seen both approaches tried,
and often fail.
But I think our generation also might be the first
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward
to dream and imagine what it will really take
to build a global economy that includes all of us,
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.
I can only talk from my own experience,
but in eight years of running Acumen fund,
I've seen the power of patient capital.
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,
but to truly build systems that have created
more than 25,000 jobs
and delivered tens of millions of services and products
to some of the poorest people on the planet.
I know it works.
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.
in whatever job you do,
to start thinking about how we might
build solutions that start
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.
Rather than what we think that they might need.
It will take embracing the world with both arms.
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,
with a sense of integrity and perseverance.
And yet these are the very qualities
for which men and women have been honored
throughout the generations.
And there is so much good that we can do.
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Okay, so
90 percent of my photographic process
is, in fact, not photographic.
It involves a campaign of letter writing,
research and phone calls
to access my subjects,
which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza
to a hibernating black bear in its cave
in West Virginia.
And oddly, the most notable
letter of rejection I ever received
came from Walt Disney World,
a seemingly innocuous site.
"Especially during these violent times,
I personally believe
that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks
is particularly important to protect
and helps to provide them with an important fantasy
they can escape to."
They didn't want to let my camera in
because it confronts constructed realities, myths and beliefs,
and provides what appears to be
evidence of a truth.
But there are multiple truths attached to every image,
depending on the creator's intention, the viewer
and the context in which it is presented.
when the American media and government were seeking
hidden and unknown sites
beyond its borders,
most notably weapons of mass destruction,
I chose to look inward at that which was integral
to America's foundation,
mythology and daily functioning.
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen,
self-imposed and real,
and confront the divide between privileged
and public access to knowledge.
and global history
where one felt they didn't have access to accurate information.
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes,
but what I came away with is a photograph.
And it's just another place from which to observe,
and the understanding that
there are no absolute, all-knowing insiders.
And the outsider can never really reach the core.
It's titled, "An American Index
of the Hidden and Unfamiliar,"
and it's comprised of nearly 70 images.
In this context I'll just show you a few.
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility
at Hanford site in Washington State,
where there are over 1,900
stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste
submerged in water.
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly.
And I found one section amongst all of these
that actually resembled the outline
of the United States of America,
which you can see here.
sort of absent in this context is text.
So I create these two poles.
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text.
And what I'm most interested in
is the invisible space between a text
and its accompanying image,
and how the image is transformed by the text
and the text by the image.
So, at best, the image is meant to float away
into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy.
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor
that kind of nails it to the ground.
But in this context I'm just going to read
an abridged version of those texts.
and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother
of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger,

undergoing hymenoplasty.
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state,
allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations
regarding virginity and marriage.
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen,
allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse,
to simulate the loss of virginity.
and you can see beyond that two-way mirror

On that table you can see 48 hours' worth

There is a pig's head and African cane rats.
And part of my photographic work
is I'm not just documenting what's there.
I do take certain liberties and intervene.
And in this I really wanted it to resemble
an early still-life painting,
so I spent some time with the smells and items.

They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations,
and in a lot of the government and technology sites
there was just this very apparent vulnerability.
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could
just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut.
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken

and hadn't necessarily progressed.

to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq.

And we put that wall around the World Church of God,
and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions
that are offered in the video games for the army.
And I put them into my photograph.
at Harvard Medical School, who is working with the U.S. Government
to develop sterilizing immunity.
Arabic language television network
that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world.
It runs 24 hours a day, commercial free.
However, it's illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States.
And in 2004, they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq,
which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq
and is broadcast to Iraq.
It's titled "The Innocents."
And for the men in these photographs,
photography had been used to create a fantasy.
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth,
in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie.
I traveled across the United States
photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted
of crimes they did not commit, violent crimes.
and its influence on memory,
which can lead to severe, even lethal consequences.
For the men in these photographs,
the primary cause of their wrongful conviction
was mistaken identification.
A victim or eyewitness identifies
a suspected perpetrator
through law enforcement's use of images.
But through exposure to composite sketches,
Polaroids, mug shots and line-ups,
eyewitness testimony can change.
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs
from which to identify her attacker.
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs,
but couldn't quite make a positive identification.
Days later, she is presented with another photo array
of all new photographs,
except that one photograph that she had some draw to
from the earlier array is repeated in the second array.
And a positive identification is made
because the photograph replaced the memory,
if there ever was an actual memory.
a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals,
and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations
of relying on photographic identifications.
where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime.
He was convicted by an all-white jury
of rape, kidnapping and vehicle theft.
And he served 10 years of a life sentence.
Now DNA exonerated Frederick
and it also implicated another man
who was serving time in prison.
But the victim refused to press charges
because she claimed that law enforcement
had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick's photograph.
of a young girl walking to school.
He served 18 years of a death sentence.
I photographed him at the scene of the crime
at the Snake River in Idaho.
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted
at sites that came to particular significance
in the history of their wrongful conviction.
The scene of arrest, the scene of misidentification,
the alibi location.
And here, the scene of the crime, it's this place
to which he's never been, but changed his life forever.
So photographing there, I was hoping to highlight
the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction,
in both his life and in photography.
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco, Texas.
where he hid between two mattresses in Gary, Indiana,
in this very room to hide from the police.
He ended up serving 18 and a half years
of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery.
The victim failed to identify Larry
in two live lineups
and then made a positive identification, days later,
from a photo array.
in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing
of a 10 year old boy at a carnival.
He is photographed at his alibi location.
of a barmaid at a club,
and served 11 years of a death sentence.
I photographed Ron at a baseball field
because he had been drafted to the Oakland A's
to play professional baseball just before his conviction.
And the state's key witness in Ron's case
was, in the end, the actual perpetrator.
for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman.
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago.
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky.
where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime,
was convicted of 3.5 years
of a 3220 year sentence,
for several charges of rape and robbery.
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim.
He was convicted of rape, kidnapping and robbery,
and served seven years of a 47 year sentence.
Troy's picture was in a photo array
that the victim tentatively had some draw toward,
but said he looked too old.
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb
from four years earlier,
which they entered into a photo array days later,
and he was positively identified.
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant,
and our eyes are easily deceived.
That's it. Thank you.
(Applause)
Thank you.
Two years ago, I stood on the TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania.
I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations.
It was a simple machine that changed my life.
I had never been away from my home
in Malawi.
I had never used a computer.
I had never seen an Internet.
On the stage that day, I was so nervous.
My English lost,
I wanted to vomit.
(Laughter)
I had never been surrounded by so many azungu,
white people.
(Laughter)
But well, I'm feeling good right now.
I would like to share that story today.
We have seven children in my family.
All sisters, excepting me.
This is me with my dad when I was a little boy.
Before I discovered the wonders of science,
I was just a simple farmer
in a country of poor farmers.
Like everyone else, we grew maize.
In 2001 we experienced an awful famine.
Within five months all Malawians began to starve to death.
My family ate one meal per day, at night.
Only three swallows of nsima for each one of us.
The food passes through our bodies.
We drop down to nothing.
you have to pay school fees.
Because of the hunger, I was forced to drop out of school.
I looked at my father
and looked at those dry fields.
It was the future I couldn't accept.
so I was determined to do anything possible
to receive education.
So I went to a library.
I read books, science books, especially physics.
I couldn't read English that well.
I used diagrams and pictures
to learn the words around them.
It said a windmill could pump water and generate electricity.
Pump water meant irrigation,
a defense against hunger,
which we were experiencing by that time.
So I decided I would build one windmill for myself.
But I didn't have materials to use,
so I went to a scrap yard
where I found my materials.
Many people, including my mother,
said I was crazy.
(Laughter)
shock absorber, PVC pipes.
Using a bicycle frame
and an old bicycle dynamo,
I built my machine.
It was one light at first.
And then four lights,
with switches, and even a circuit breaker,
modeled after an electric bell.
Another machine pumps water
for irrigation.
(Laughter)
to charge their mobile phone.
(Applause)
I could not get rid of them.
(Laughter)
And the reporters came too,
which lead to bloggers
and which lead to a call from something called TED.
I had never seen an airplane before.
I had never slept in a hotel.
So, on stage that day in Arusha,
my English lost,
I said something like,
"I tried. And I made it."
to all the people out there like me
to the Africans, and the poor
who are struggling with your dreams.
God bless.
Maybe one day you will watch this on the Internet.
I say to you, trust yourself and believe.
Whatever happens, don't give up.
Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,
I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,
which, as some of you may know,
is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.
So that's why I've always been fascinated
with how technology could actually reshape
and open up authoritarian societies like ours.
and, feeling very idealistic,
I decided to join the NGO
which actually was using new media
to promote democracy and media reform
in much of the former Soviet Union.
However, to my surprise,
I discovered that dictatorships
do not crumble so easily.
In fact, some of them actually
survived the Internet challenge,
and some got even more repressive.
decided to quit my NGO job
and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.
Now, I must tell you that this was never
a very popular argument,
and it's probably not very popular yet
with some of you sitting in this audience.
It was never popular with many political leaders,
especially those in the United States
who somehow thought that new media
would be able to do what missiles couldn't.
That is, promote democracy in difficult places
where everything else has already been tried and failed.
And I think by 2009,
this news has finally reached Britain,
so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.
which has driven so much of this debate. Right?
So if you look at it close enough,
you'll actually see that much of this
is about economics.
The cybertopians say, much like fax machines
and Xerox machines did in the '80s,
blogs and social networks
have radically transformed the economics of protest,
so people would inevitably rebel.
To put it very simply,
the assumption so far has been
that if you give people enough connectivity,
if you give them enough devices,
democracy will inevitably follow.
I never really bought into this argument,
in part because I never saw three American presidents
agree on anything else in the past.
(Laughter)
But, you know, even beyond that,
if you think about the logic underlying it,
is something I call iPod liberalism,
where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese
who happens to have and love his iPod
will also love liberal democracy.
And again, I think this is kind of false.
is that this logic --
that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --
I mean, it would make a fascinating title
for Thomas Friedman's new book.
(Laughter)
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?
So, the bigger problem with this logic
is that it confuses the intended
versus the actual uses of technology.
For those of you who think that
new media of the Internet
could somehow help us avert genocide,
should look no further than Rwanda,
where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations
which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.
what you can actually see
is that certain governments
have mastered the use of cyberspace
for propaganda purposes. Right?
And they are building what I call the Spinternet.
The combination of spin, on the one hand,
and the Internet on the other.
So governments from Russia to China to Iran
are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers
in order to leave ideological comments
and create a lot of ideological blog posts
to comment on sensitive political issues. Right?
Why are they engaging with cyberspace?
Well my theory is that
it's happening because censorship actually
is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.
The moment you put something critical in a blog,
even if you manage to ban it immediately,
it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.
So the more you block it,
the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship
and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.
So the only way to control this message
is actually to try to spin it
and accuse anyone who has written something critical
of being, for example, a CIA agent.
Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.
There was a big case in February 2009
called "Elude the Cat."
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.
So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,
a Chinese man, died in prison custody.
And police said that it happened
because he was playing hide and seek,
which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,
with other inmates and hit his head
against the wall,
which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,
had 35,000 comments
on this issue within hours.
But then authorities did something very smart.
Instead of trying to purge these comments,
they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.
And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."
So 500 people applied,
and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,
and thus inspect it and then blog about it.
Within days the entire incident was forgotten,
which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.
People would keep talking about it for weeks.
about what's happening in authoritarian states
and in their cyberspace.
This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,
and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics
and letting them engage with each other online.
We tend to think
that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,
but in many cases it only strengthens them.
And you may wonder why.
I'll just give you a very short list of reasons
why authoritarian deliberation
may actually help the dictators.
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.
They don't really have the data they need
in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.
So encouraging people to actually go online
and share information and data
on blogs and wikis is great
because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats
will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?
So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis
produce knowledge has been great.
is also great
because it helps you to share the blame
for the policies which eventually fail.
Because they say, "Well look, we asked you,
we consulted you, you voted on it.
You put it on the front page of your blog.
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."
any authoritarian deliberation efforts
is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,
having them participate in decision making,
it's actually great.
Because what happens is that then
you can actually point to this initiative and say,
"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."
one of the Russian regions, for example,
now involves its citizens
in planning its strategy up until year 2020.
Right? So they can go online
and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know
that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.
So having people involved in planning for 2020
is not necessarily going to change anything,
because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.
we all heard about the Twitter revolution
that happened there,
but if you look close enough, you'll actually see
that many of the networks and blogs
and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.
They may have become slower,
but the activists could still access it
and actually argue that having access to them
is actually great for many authoritarian states.
And it's great simply because
they can gather open source intelligence.
to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.
Now you actually know how they connect to each other
by looking at their Facebook page.
I mean KGB, and not just KGB,
used to torture in order to actually get this data.
Now it's all available online.
(Laughter)
that cybertopians made
is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.
We often hear about cyber activism,
how people are getting more active because of the Internet.
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,
how people are becoming passive.
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet
is going to be the catalyst of change
that will push young people into the streets,
while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses
which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.
That's not an option being considered too strongly.
there may as well be two digital captives
who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it
because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people
and it plays a completely different social role for them.
on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,
you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,
for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,
is three times more than in the United States.
So it does play a social role,
however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.
is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,
a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.
But the point here is that
when we get the remote Russian village online,
what will get people to the Internet
is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.
It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"
or maybe watching funny videos of cats.
So this is something you have to recognize.
Well I say we have to stop thinking
about the number of iPods per capita
and start thinking about ways in which
we can empower intellectuals,
dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.
Because even what has been happening up 'til now
with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,
there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.
So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions
and actually start doing something about it.
Thank you.
(Applause)
and in my recent work I've been a bit of a pessimist.
So I thought this morning I would try to be the optimist,

The Internet has no business plan, never did.

So unusual, in fact,

And seeing with the brain is often called imagination.
But there are also hallucinations as well.
And hallucinations are completely different.
They don't seem to be of our creation.
They don't seem to be under control.
They told me that one of their residents, an old lady in her 90s,
was seeing things,
or, because she was an old lady,
whether she'd had a stroke, or whether she had Alzheimer's.
the old lady.
I went in to see her.
that she was blind,
that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years.
And she said, "People in Eastern dress,
A man who turns towards me and smiles,
but he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth.
I see cats and dogs walking towards me.
They come to a certain point and then stop.
I see a lot of children. They're walking up and down stairs.
They wear bright colors, rose and blue,
she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor,
I said, "Is this like a dream?"
And she said it's a rather boring movie.
and she'd never had a hallucination before.
And she didn't know what was going on.
She wasn't on any medications which could produce hallucinations.
But she was blind.
I said, "There is a special form of visual hallucination
which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness.
"right back in the 18th century,
by a man called Charles Bonnet.
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome.
Well, so, I did tell the nurses.
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people
get visual hallucinations.
You don't have to be completely blind,
His grandfather had these hallucinations.
His vision was pretty poor.
And in 1759, he described to his grandson
And he knew it was a hallucination.
You don't have handkerchiefs in midair.
And then he saw a big wheel in midair.
But sometimes he wasn't sure whether he was hallucinating or not,
It's typical of these hallucinations
that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash.
saw hundreds of different figures,
and realized it was himself.
That was the only figure he recognized.
he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding.
what seems to be going on --
and Rosalie said, "What's going on?" --
and I said that as you lose vision,
as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input,
they become hyperactive and excitable,
who started walking towards her.
And then the six figures came together, like a concertina.
Once, when she was driving,
or rather, her husband was driving,
the road divided into four
and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads.
This was a woman who didn't have trouble with her eyes
but the visual parts of her brain,
And these cartoons would be transparent,
"Kermit the Frog means nothing to me."
and as with Rosalie, the faces were often deformed,
with very large teeth or very large eyes.
Well, what is going on with these people?
especially to reassure them that they're not going insane.
of visually impaired people get these.
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them,
because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something.
But the psychotic hallucinations are quite different.
Psychotic hallucinations, whether they are visual or vocal,

located in space and time,
coherent, dramatic.
from the geometrical hallucinations --
the pink and blue squares the woman had --
And one of the second commonest is cartoons.
Fascinatingly, in the last few years,
it's been possible to do functional brain imagery,
as they are hallucinating.
When people have these simple, geometrical hallucinations,
the primary visual cortex is activated.
they may lose the ability to recognize faces.
they may hallucinate faces,
when one sees cartoons.
It's very interesting that that should be specific.
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved
which can be very, very specific.
or figments or fragments.
you don't go to those higher levels.
You're in these levels of inferior visual cortex,
or figments or fragmentary figments,
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind
Suddenly this and suddenly that.
The mind does its best to organize
and to give some sort of coherence to this,
it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams.
But, in fact, people say,
Think of the number of blind people.
but are too scared to mention them.
for giving one some insight as to how the brain works.
how, as he put it, the theater of the mind
could be generated by the machinery of the brain.
And, actually, I'm a little visually impaired myself.
I'm blind in one eye and not terribly good in the other.
And I see the geometrical hallucinations.
But they stop there.
which I ignore.
They occasionally interest me,
and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks.
I've gone and had an fMRI myself,
to see how my visual cortex is ticking over.
And when I see all these hexagons
and complex things, which I also have,
in visual migraine,
I wonder whether everyone sees things like this
may have been derived from them a bit.
So the question is, what is invisible?
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters
except every thing and except matter.
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:
"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,
when the husband was killed by the wife."
(Laughter)
There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?
(Laughter)
but we can't see what holds them apart
or what draws them together.
With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.
We can't see into the engine room.
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff,
if you look at the basic substructure of matter,
there isn't anything there.
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,
and there is only energy. And you can't see energy.
One slightly silly thing that's invisible
is this story, which is invisible to you.
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.
Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed
by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.
(Laughter)
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent
saying how much she admired him,
had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.
(Laughter)
"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,
she turns it to her advantage.
A photo is not enough."
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,
"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."
After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,
"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."
(Laughter)
(Laughter)
is that things that we can't see
we also can't understand.
Gravity is one thing that we can't see
and which we don't understand.
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,
and the weakest.
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.
he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.
That's what he thought he was there for.
So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.
(Laughter)
I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?
Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?
But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.
which some claim is the route of all religions,
Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.
But their main exercise of telepathy
is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.
So that's why we don't think it exists,
the Sufi masters working on us.
and artificial intelligence,
artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,
gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.
With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,
they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.
(Laughter)
Remind you of anyone?
Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.
And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?
I'm an ignostic.
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,
until somebody properly defines the terms.
(Laughter)
And this is increasingly peculiar,
because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,
they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.
Geneticists will know this, but every year since,
it's been revised downwards.
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000
genes in the human genome.
rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?
Two more than people,
and the same as a gorilla.
(Laughter)
You can't see these things, but they are very strange.
(Laughter)
The universe disappears.
The more light there is, the less you can see.
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics,
there is a big movement in modern physics
to decide that time doesn't really exist,
because it's too inconvenient for the figures.
It's much easier if it's not really there.
You can't see the future, obviously.
And you can't see the past, except in your memory.
you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,
he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"
what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,
which is great news for psychoanalysts,
because otherwise they'd be out of a job.
Because that's where all the stuff happens
(Laughter)
that makes you who you are.
This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,
that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.
Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.
Taste buds, every 10 days or so.
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.
But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body
remains from what was there seven years ago.
The question is, who, then, are we?
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on,
that is actually us?
Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.
Gas, you can't see that.
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.
Gas was invented in 1600
by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.
It's said to be the most successful ever invention
of a word by a known individual.
Quite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"
meaning astral radiation.
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.
(Laughter)
But well done, him.
(Laughter)
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,
if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,
you can only see what it hits.
I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,
not to be able to see darkness.
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.
They don't. Nobody knows what it is.
(Laughter)
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire
move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light
when you turn the light on. They don't.
Electrons bumble down the wire,
about the speed of spreading honey, they say.
(Laughter)
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,
and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,
he called them radio waves because they radiated.
And somebody said to him,
"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?
What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"
And he said, "Well, I've no idea.
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."
And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.
that's invisible to us is what we don't know.
It is incredible how little we know.
Thomas Edison once said,
"We don't know one percent of one millionth
about anything."
because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"
The point, most of us. What's the point?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,
like an electron, oddly enough.
is there are only two questions really worth asking.
"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?
And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,
perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,
one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.
"I don't know why we are here.
But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."
(Laughter)
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?
(Laughter)
one of my favorite poets, who said,
"We are here on earth
to help others.
What the others are here for, I've no idea."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
The public debate about architecture
quite often just stays on contemplating the final result,
the architectural object.
Is the latest tower in London
a gherkin or a sausage
or a sex tool?
if we could invent a format
that could actually tell the stories behind the projects,
maybe combining images and drawings and words
to actually sort of tell stories about architecture.
And we discovered that we didn't have to invent it,
it already existed in the form of a comic book.
to actually tell the stories of behind the scenes,
how our projects actually evolve through adaptation
and improvisation.
Sort of through the turmoil and the opportunities
and the incidents of the real world.
We call this comic book "Yes is More,"
which is obviously a sort of evolution of the ideas of some of our heroes.
He triggered the modernist revolution.
After him followed the post-modern counter-revolution,
Robert Venturi saying, "Less is a bore."
After him, Philip Johnson sort of introduced
(Laughter)
you could say promiscuity, or at least openness
to new ideas with, "I am a whore."
Recently, Obama has introduced optimism
at a sort of time of global financial crisis.
is basically trying to question this idea
that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined,
as who or what we are against.
The cliche of the radical architect
is the sort of angry young man rebelling against the establishment.
Or this idea of the misunderstood genius,
frustrated that the world doesn't fit in with his or her ideas.
Rather than revolution, we're much more interested in evolution,
this idea that things gradually evolve
by adapting and improvising
to the changes of the world.
who best explains our design process.
His famous evolutionary tree
could almost be a diagram of the way we work.
As you can see, a project evolves through
a series of generations of design meetings.
At each meeting, there's way too many ideas.
Only the best ones can survive.
And through a process of architectural selection,
we might choose a really beautiful model
or we might have a very functional model.
We mate them. They have sort of mutant offspring.
And through these sort of generations of design meetings
we arrive at a design.
for a library and a hotel in Copenhagen.
The design process was really tough,
almost like a struggle for survival,
but gradually an idea evolved:
this sort of idea of a rational tower
that melts together with the surrounding city,
sort of expanding the public space onto what we refer to as
a Scandinavian version of the Spanish Steps in Rome,
but sort of public on the outside, as well as on the inside,
with the library.
As you can see, sometimes a subspecies branches off.
And quite often we sit in a design meeting
and we discover that there is this great idea.
It doesn't really work in this context.
But for another client in another culture,
it could really be the right answer to a different question.
So as a result, we never throw anything out.
We keep our office almost like an archive
of architectural biodiversity.
You never know when you might need it.
warp-speed storytelling,
is tell the story of how two projects evolved
by adapting and improvising
to the happenstance of the world.
The first story starts last year when we went to Shanghai
to do the competition for the Danish
National Pavilion for the World Expo in 2010.
And we saw this guy, Haibao.
He's the mascot of the expo,
and he looks strangely familiar.
In fact he looked like a building we had designed
for a hotel in the north of Sweden.
When we submitted it for the Swedish competition we thought
it was a really cool scheme, but it didn't exactly
look like something from the north of Sweden.
The Swedish jury didn't think so either. So we lost.
who saw our design and said,
"Wow, that's the Chinese character for the word 'people.'"
(Laughter)
So, apparently this is how you write "people,"
as in the People's Republic of China.
We even double checked.
And at the same time, we got invited to exhibit
at the Shanghai Creative Industry Week.
So we thought like, this is too much of an opportunity,
so we hired a feng shui master.
We scaled the building up three times to Chinese proportions,
and went to China.
(Laughter)
So the People's Building, as we called it.
This is our two interpreters, sort of reading the architecture.
which got Mr. Liangyu Chen, the mayor of Shanghai,
to visit the exhibition.
And we had the chance to explain the project.
And he said, "Shanghai is the city in the world
with most skyscrapers,"
but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over.
And with the People's Building, he saw an architecture
that could bridge the gap between the ancient wisdom of China
and the progressive future of China.
So we obviously profoundly agreed with him.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Unfortunately, Mr. Chen is now in prison for corruption.
(Laughter)
because he is actually the Chinese character for "people."
And they chose this mascot because
the theme of the expo is "Better City, Better Life."
Sustainability.
And we thought, sustainability has grown into being
this sort of neo-Protestant idea
that it has to hurt in order to do good.
You're not supposed to fly on holidays because it's bad for the environment.
Gradually, you get this idea that sustainable life
is less fun than normal life.
So we thought that maybe it could be interesting to focus on examples
where a sustainable city
actually increases the quality of life.
that would be relevant?
You know, it's one of the biggest countries in the world, one of the smallest.
China symbolized by the dragon.
Denmark, we have a national bird, the swan.
(Laughter)
China has many great poets,
public school curriculum,
they have three fairy tales by An Tu Sheng,
or Hans Christian Anderson, as we call him.
So that means that all 1.3 billion Chinese
have grown up with "The Emperor's New Clothes,"
"The Matchstick Girl" and "The Little Mermaid."
It's almost like a fragment of Danish culture
integrated into Chinese culture.
The Great Wall is the only thing that can be seen from the moon.
The big tourist attraction in Denmark is The Little Mermaid.
That can actually hardly be seen from the canal tours.
(Laughter)
Copenhagen, Shanghai,
modern, European.
But then we looked at recent urban development,
and we noticed that this is like a Shanghai street,
30 years ago. All bikes, no cars.
This is how it looks today; all traffic jam.
Bicycles have become forbidden many places.
A third of all the people commute by bike.
We have a free system of bicycles called the City Bike
that you can borrow if you visit the city.
So we thought, why don't we reintroduce the bicycle in China?
We donate 1,000 bikes to Shanghai.
So if you come to the expo, go straight to the Danish pavilion,
get a Danish bike, and then continue on that to visit the other pavilions.
but in Copenhagen the water has gotten so clean
that you can actually swim in it.
One of the first projects we ever did
was the harbor bath in Copenhagen,
sort of continuing the public realm into the water.
So we thought that these expos quite often have a lot of
state financed propaganda,
images, statements, but no real experience.
So just like with a bike, we don't talk about it.
You can try it.
Like with the water, instead of talking about it,
we're going to sail a million liters of harbor water
from Copenhagen to Shanghai,
so the Chinese who have the courage can actually dive in
and feel how clean it is.
to sail water from Copenhagen to China.
But in fact, the container ships go
full of goods from China to Denmark,
and then they sail empty back.
So quite often you load water for ballast.
So we can actually hitch a ride for free.
we're actually going to put the actual Little Mermaid.
So the real Mermaid, the real water, and the real bikes.
And when she's gone, we're going to invite
a Chinese artist to reinterpret her.
The architecture of the pavilion is this sort of loop
of exhibition and bikes.
When you go to the exhibition, you'll see the Mermaid and the pool.
You'll walk around, start looking for a bicycle on the roof,
jump on your ride and then continue out into the rest of the expo.
we had to do an exhibition in China explaining the project.
And to our surprise we got one of our boards back
with corrections from the Chinese state censorship.
The first thing, the China map missed Taiwan.
It's a very serious political issue in China. We will add on.
The second thing, we had compared the swan to the dragon,
and then the Chinese state said,
"Suggest change to panda."
(Laughter)
(Applause)
move our national monument,
the National People's Party sort of rebelled against it.
They tried to pass a law against moving the Mermaid.
So for the first time, I got invited to speak at the National Parliament.
It was kind of interesting because in the morning, from 9 to 11,
they were discussing the bailout package --
how many billions to invest in saving the Danish economy.
And then at 11 o'clock they stopped talking about these little issues.
And then from 11 to 1,
they were debating whether or not to send the Mermaid to China.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
next year, don't come to Copenhagen,
because she's going to be in Shanghai.
If you do come to Copenhagen,
you will probably see an installation by Ai Weiwei, the Chinese artist.
But if the Chinese government intervenes, it might even be a panda.
(Laughter)
is, actually starts in my own house.
This is my apartment.
This is the view from my apartment,
over the sort of landscape of triangular balconies
that our client called the Leonardo DiCaprio balcony.
And they form this sort of vertical backyard
where, on a nice summer day, you'll actually get introduced to all your neighbors
in a vertical radius of 10 meters.
The house is sort of a distortion of a square block.
Trying to zigzag it to make sure
that all of the apartments look at the straight views,
instead of into each other.
onto this place where our client actually bought the neighbor site.
And he said that he was going to do an apartment block
next to a parking structure.
And we thought, rather than doing a traditional stack of apartments
looking straight into a big boring block of cars,
why don't we turn all the apartments into penthouses,
put them on a podium of cars.
if you want to have a nice south-facing slope with a view,
you basically have to do it yourself.
Then we sort of cut up the volume,
so we wouldn't block the view from my apartment.
(Laughter)
And essentially the parking is sort of occupying the deep space
underneath the apartments.
that combine all the splendors of a suburban lifestyle,
like a house with a garden with a sort of metropolitan view,
and a sort of dense urban location.
This is our first architectural model.
This is an aerial photo taken last summer.
And essentially, the apartments cover the parking.
They are accessed through this diagonal elevator.
It's actually a stand-up product from Switzerland,
because in Switzerland they have a natural need for diagonal elevators.
(Laughter)
we wanted to make the parking naturally ventilated,
so we needed to perforate it.
And we discovered that by controlling the size of the holes,
we could actually turn the entire facade
into a gigantic, naturally ventilated,
rasterized image.
And since we always refer to the project as The Mountain,
we commissioned this Japanese Himalaya photographer
to give us this beautiful photo of Mount Everest,
making the entire building a 3,000 square meter artwork.
(Applause)
it's almost like traveling into a parallel universe
from cars and colors,
into this sort of south-facing urban oasis.
The wood of your apartment continues outside becoming the facades.
If you go even further, it turns into this green garden.
And all the rainwater that drops on the Mountain
is actually accumulated.
And there is an automatic irrigation system
that makes sure that this sort of landscape of gardens,
in one or two years it will sort of transform
into a Cambodian temple ruin,
completely covered in green.
of what we like to refer to as architectural alchemy.
This idea that you can actually create, if not gold,
then at least added value by mixing
traditional ingredients, like normal apartments
and normal parking,
and in this case actually offer people
the chance that they don't have to choose between
a life with a garden or a life in the city.
They can actually have both.
You can't just say that now I'd like to do a sustainable city
in central Asia,
because that's not really how you get commissions.
You always have to sort of adapt and improvise
to the opportunities and accidents that happen,
and the sort of turmoil of the world.
like last summer, we won the competition
to design a Nordic national bank.
This was the director of the bank when he was still smiling.
(Laughter)
It was in the middle of the capital so we were really excited by this opportunity.
Unfortunately, it was the national bank of Iceland.
a minister from Azerbaijan came to our office.
We took him to see the Mountain. And he got very excited
by this idea that you could actually make mountains
out of architecture,
because Azerbaijan is known as the Alps of Central Asia.
So he asked us if we could actually imagine
an urban master plan
on an island outside the capital
that would recreate the silhouette of the seven most significant mountains
of Azerbaijan.
And we made this small movie that I'd like to show.
We quite often make little movies.
We always argue a lot about the soundtrack,
but in this case it was really easy to choose the song.
So basically, Baku is this sort of crescent bay
overlooking the island of Zira, the island that we are planning --
almost like the diagram of their flag.
And our main idea was
to sort of sample the seven most significant mountains
of the topography of Azerbaijan
and reinterpret them into urban and architectural structures,
inhabitable of human life.
Then we place these mountains on the island,
surrounding this sort of central green valley,
almost like a central park.
is just a piece of desert. It has no vegetation.
It has no water. It has no energy, no resources.
So we actually sort of designed the entire island as a single ecosystem,
exploiting wind energy to drive the desalination plants,
and to use the thermal properties of water
to heat and cool the buildings.
And all the sort of excess freshwater wastewater
is filtered organically into the landscape,
gradually transforming the desert island
into sort of a green, lush landscape.
normally happens at the expense of nature,
in this case it's actually creating nature.
And the buildings, they don't only sort of
invoke the imagery of the mountains,
they also operate like mountains.
They create shelter from the wind.
They accumulate the solar energy.
They accumulate the water.
So they actually transform the entire island
into a single ecosystem.
and it has gotten approved.
And this summer we are starting the construction documents
of the two first mountains,
in what's going to be the first carbon-neutral island
in Central Asia.
(Applause)
Yes, maybe just to round off.
So in a way you can see how the Mountain in Copenhagen
sort of evolved into the Seven Peaks of Azerbaijan.
With a little luck and some more evolution,
maybe in 10 years it could be the Five Mountains on Mars.
Thank you.
(Applause)
These are grim economic times,
fellow TEDsters, grim economic times indeed.
And so, I would like to cheer you up
with one of the great, albeit largely unknown,
commercial success stories
of the past 20 years.
Comparable, in its own very peculiar way,
to the achievements of Microsoft or Google.
And it's an industry which has bucked the current recession
with equanimity.
I refer to organized crime.
for a very long time, I hear you say,
and these would be wise words, indeed.
But in the last two decades,
it has experienced an unprecedented expansion,
now accounting for roughly 15 percent
of the world's GDP.
I like to call it the Global Shadow Economy,
or McMafia, for short.
in cross-border crime?
Well, of course, there is globalization,
technology, communications, all that stuff,
which we'll talk about a little bit later.
But first, I would like to take you back
to this event:
the collapse of communism.
All across Eastern Europe, a most momentous episode
in our post-war history.
This event meant a great deal to me personally.
I had started smuggling books across the Iron Curtain
to Democratic opposition groups in Eastern Europe,
like Solidarity in Poland,
when I was in my teens.
I then started writing about Eastern Europe,
and eventually I became the BBC's chief correspondent for the region,
which is what I was doing in 1989.
And so when 425 million people
finally won the right
to choose their own governments,
I was ecstatic,
but I was also a touch worried
about some of the nastier things
lurking behind the wall.
before ethnic nationalism
reared its bloody head
in Yugoslavia.
And amongst the chaos,
amidst the euphoria,
it took me a little while to understand
that some of the people who had wielded power
before 1989, in Eastern Europe,
continued to do so after the revolutions there.
Obviously there were characters like this.
But there were also some more unexpected people
who played a critical role in what was going on in Eastern Europe.
They used to win the gold medals in weightlifting
and wrestling, every four years in the Olympics,
and they were the great celebrities of communism,
with a fabulous lifestyle to go with it.
They used to get great apartments in the center of town,
casual sex on tap,
and they could travel to the West very freely,
which was a great luxury at the time.
It may come as a surprise, but they played a critical role
in the emergence of the market economy
in Eastern Europe.
Or as I like to call them, they are
the midwives of capitalism.
Here are some of those same weightlifters
after their 1989 makeover.
this photograph was taken in Bulgaria --
when communism collapsed all over Eastern Europe,
it wasn't just communism;
it was the state that collapsed as well.
That means your police force wasn't working.
The court system wasn't functioning properly.
So what was a business man in the brave new world
of East European capitalism going to do
to make sure that his contracts would be honored?
Well, he would turn to people who were called, rather prosaically
by sociologists, privatized law enforcement agencies.
We prefer to know them as the mafia.
And in Bulgaria, the mafia was soon joined
with 14,000 people
who were sacked from their jobs in the security services
between 1989 and 1991.
your economy is heading south at a rate of knots,
the last people you want coming on to the labor market
are 14,000 men and women whose chief skills
are surveillance,
are smuggling, building underground networks
and killing people.
But that's what happened all over Eastern Europe.
Now, when I was working in the 1990s,
I spent most of the time covering
the appalling conflict in Yugoslavia.
that the people who were perpetrating the appalling atrocities,
the paramilitary organizations,
were actually the same people running
the organized criminal syndicates.
And I came to think that behind the violence
lay a sinister criminal enterprise.
And so I resolved to travel around the world
examining this global criminal underworld
by talking to policemen,
by talking to victims, by talking to consumers
of illicit goods and services.
But above all else, by talking to the gangsters themselves.
Why? Well of course
there was the issue of law and order collapsing,
but also, as they say in the retail trade,
it's location, location, location.
And what I noticed at the beginning of my research
that the Balkans had turned into a vast transit zone
for illicit goods and services coming from all over the world.
Heroin, cocaine,
women being trafficked into prostitution
and precious minerals.
The European Union, which by now
was beginning to reap the benefits of globalization,
transforming it into
the most affluent consumer market in history,
eventually comprising some 500 million people.
And a significant minority
of those 500 million people
like to spend some of their leisure time and spare cash
sleeping with prostitutes,
sticking 50 Euro notes up their nose
and employing illegal migrant laborers.
operates in the same way as any other business.
It has zones of production,
like Afghanistan and Columbia.
It has zones of distribution,
like Mexico and the Balkans.
And then, of course, it has zones of consumption,
like the European Union, Japan
and of course, the United States.
The zones of production and distribution
tend to lie in the developing world,
and they are often threatened by appalling violence
and bloodshed.
Six thousand people killed there in the last 18 months
as a direct consequence of the cocaine trade.
But what about the Democratic Republic of Congo?
Since 1998, five million people have died there.
It's not a conflict you read about much in the newspapers,
but it's the biggest conflict on this planet
since the Second World War.
And why is it? Because mafias from all around the world
cooperate with local paramilitaries
in order to seize the supplies
of the rich mineral resources
of the region.
was sourced to the killing fields
of the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.
Now, coltan you will find in almost every mobile phone,
in almost every laptop
and games console.
The Congolese war lords were selling this stuff to the mafia
in exchange for weapons,
and the mafia would then sell it on to Western markets.
And it is this Western desire
to consume
that is the primary driver
of international organized crime.
caught conveniently on film by the Italian police,
and smuggling duty-not-paid cigarettes.
Now, cigarettes out the factory gate are very cheap.
The European Union then imposes the highest taxes on them in the world.
So if you can smuggle them into the E.U.,
there are very handsome profits to be made,
and I want to show you this to demonstrate
the type of resources available to these groups.
And it's the fastest thing on European waters.
From 1994, for seven years,
20 of these boats
made the trip across the Adriatic,
from Montenegro to Italy, every single night.
And as a consequence of this trade,
Britain alone lost eight billion dollars in revenue.
And instead that money went to underwrite the wars in Yugoslavia
and line the pockets of unscrupulous individuals.
had just two boats which could go at the same speed.
And this is very important, because the only way you can catch these guys
is if they run out of gas.
Sometimes the gangsters would bring with them
women being trafficked into prostitution,
and if the police intervened, they would hurl
the women into the sea
so that the police had to go and save them from drowning,
rather than chasing the bad guys.
how many boats, how many vessels it takes
to catch one of these guys.
And the answer is six vessels.
And remember, 20 of these speed boats
were coming across the Adriatic
every single night.
So what were these guys doing with all the money they were making?
because that was not just the deregulation of global trade.
It was the liberalization of international financial markets.
And boy, did that make it easy
for the money launderers.
The last two decades have been the champagne era
for dirty lucre.
competing for their business,
and there was simply no effective mechanism
to prevent money laundering.
And a lot of licit banks were also happy
to accept deposits
from very dubious sources
without questions being asked.
Now these things
are an essential part of the money laundering parade,
and if you want to do something about illegal tax evasion
and transnational organized crime, money laundering,
you have to get rid of them.
On a positive note, we at last have someone in the White House
who has consistently spoken out
against these corrosive entities.
is the necessity for
new legislation, regulation, effective regulation,
I say, let's take a look at Bernie Madoff,
who is now going to be spending the rest of his life in jail.
Bernie Madoff stole 65 billion dollars.
That puts him up there on the Olympus of gangsters
with the Colombian cartels
and the major Russian crime syndicates,
but he did this for decades
in the very heart of Wall Street,
and no regulator picked up on it.
So how many other Madoffs are there on Wall Street
or in the city of London,
fleecing ordinary folk
and money laundering?
Well I can tell you, it's quite a few of them.
And that is narcotics. Our second marijuana farm photograph for the morning.
This one, however, is in central British Columbia
where I photographed it.
It's one of the tens of thousands
of mom-and-pop grow-ops in B.C.
which ensure that over five percent
of the province's GDP is accounted for by this trade.
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
to a cavernous warehouse east of Vancouver
to see some of the goods which are regularly confiscated
by the RCMP
from the smugglers who are sending it,
of course, down south to the United States
where there is an insatiable market
for B.C. Bud, as it's called,
in part because it's marketed as organic,
which of course goes down very well in California.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
this makes not a dent in the profits, really,
of the major exporters.
Since the beginning of globalization,
the global narcotics market has expanded enormously.
There has, however, been no concomitant increase
in the resources available
to police forces.
because something very strange is going on.
The United Nations recognized
earlier this -- it was last month actually --
that Canada has become a key area of distribution and production
of ecstasy and other synthetic drugs.
of heroin and cocaine is going down,
because the pills are getting ever better at reproducing their highs.
Now that is a game changer,
because it shifts production away from the developing world
and into the Western world.
When that happens, it is a trend
which is set to overwhelm our policing capacity in the West.
The drugs policy which we've had in place for 40 years
is long overdue for a very serious rethink,
in my opinion.
Well, organized crime has already adapted
very well to the recession.
Not surprising, the most opportunistic industry
in the whole world.
And it has no rules to its regulatory system.
Except, of course, it has two business risks:
arrest by law enforcement,
which is, frankly, the least of their worries,
and competition from other groups,
i.e. a bullet in the back of the head.
People don't smoke as much dope, or visit prostitutes quite so frequently
during a recession.
And so instead, they have invaded financial
and corporate crime in a big way,
but above all, two sectors,
and that is counterfeit goods
and cybercrime.
And it's been terribly successful.
I would like to introduce you to Mr. Pringle.
Or perhaps I should say, more accurately, Señor Pringle.
We sat in a car on the Avenue Paulista
in São Paulo, together.
Hooked it up to my laptop,
and within about five minutes he had penetrated
the computer security system
of a major Brazilian bank.
It's really not that difficult.
And it's actually much easier because
the fascinating thing about cybercrime
is that it's not so much the technology.
Or to use the technical term for it,
there's one born every minute.
You would not believe how easy it is
to persuade people to do things with their computers
which are objectively not in their interest.
And it was very soon
when the cybercriminals learned that the quickest way to do this,
of course, the quickest way to a person's wallet
is through the promise of sex and love.
one of the very great worldwide viruses that came.
I was very fortunate when the ILOVEYOU virus came out,
because the first person I received it from
was an ex-girlfriend of mine.
Now, she harbored all sorts of sentiments and emotions towards me at the time,
but love was not amongst them.
(Laughter)
And so as soon as I saw this drop into my inbox,
I dispatched it hastily to the recycle bin
and spared myself a very nasty infection.
One thing that we do know that the Internet is doing
is the Internet is assisting these guys.
These are mosquitos who carry the malarial parasite
which infests our blood when the mosy has had a free meal
at our expense.
at destroying the parasite in the early days
of infection.
But over the past year or so,
researchers in Cambodia have discovered
that what's happening is
the malarial parasite is developing a resistance.
And they fear that the reason why it's developing a resistance
is because Cambodians can't afford the drugs on the commercial market,
and so they buy it from the Internet.
And these pills contain only low doses
of the active ingredient.
Which is why
the parasite is beginning to develop a resistance.
is because we have to know
that organized crime
impacts all sorts of areas of our lives.
You don't have to sleep with prostitutes
or take drugs
in order to have a relationship with organized crime.
They affect our bank accounts.
They affect our communications, our pension funds.
They even affect the food that we eat
and our governments.
of Sicilians from Palermo and New York.
There is no romance involved with gangsters
in the 21st Century.
This is a mighty industry,
and it creates instability and violence
wherever it goes.
It is a major economic force
and we need to take it very, very seriously.
It's been a privilege talking to you.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Today I'm going to talk to you about the problem of other minds.
And the problem I'm going to talk about
is not the familiar one from philosophy,
which is, "How can we know
whether other people have minds?"
That is, maybe you have a mind,
and everyone else is just a really convincing robot.
So that's a problem in philosophy,
but for today's purposes I'm going to assume
that many people in this audience have a mind,
and that I don't have to worry about this.
as parents and teachers and spouses
and novelists,
which is, "Why is it so hard
to know what somebody else wants or believes?"
Or perhaps, more relevantly,
"Why is it so hard to change what somebody else wants or believes?"
Like Philip Roth, who said,
"And yet, what are we to do about this terribly significant business
of other people?
So ill equipped are we all,
to envision one another's interior workings
and invisible aims."
So as a teacher and as a spouse,
this is, of course, a problem I confront every day.
But as a scientist, I'm interested in a different problem of other minds,
and that is the one I'm going to introduce to you today.
And that problem is, "How is it so easy
to know other minds?"
you need almost no information,
one snapshot of a stranger,
to guess what this woman is thinking,
or what this man is.
And put another way, the crux of the problem is
the machine that we use for thinking about other minds,
our brain, is made up of pieces, brain cells,
that we share with all other animals, with monkeys
and mice and even sea slugs.
And yet, you put them together in a particular network,
and what you get is the capacity to write Romeo and Juliet.
Or to say, as Alan Greenspan did,
"I know you think you understand what you thought I said,
but I'm not sure you realize that what you heard
is not what I meant."
(Laughter)
is to stand with these ideas,
one in each hand.
And to try to understand how you can put together
simple units, simple messages over space and time, in a network,
and get this amazing human capacity to think about minds.
So I'm going to tell you three things about this today.
Obviously the whole project here is huge.
And I'm going to tell you just our first few steps
about the discovery of a special brain region
for thinking about other people's thoughts.
Some observations on the slow development of this system
as we learn how to do this difficult job.
And then finally, to show that some of the differences
between people, in how we judge others,
can be explained by differences in this brain system.
there is a brain region in the human brain, in your brains,
whose job it is to think about other people's thoughts.
This is a picture of it.
It's called the Right Temporo-Parietal Junction.
It's above and behind your right ear.
And this is the brain region you used when you saw the pictures I showed you,
or when you read Romeo and Juliet
or when you tried to understand Alan Greenspan.
And you don't use it for solving any other kinds of logical problems.
So this brain region is called the Right TPJ.
And this picture shows the average activation
in a group of what we call typical human adults.
They're MIT undergraduates.
(Laughter)
is that although we human adults
are really good at understanding other minds,
we weren't always that way.
It takes children a long time to break into the system.
I'm going to show you a little bit of that long, extended process.
The first thing I'm going to show you is a change between age three and five,
as kids learn to understand
that somebody else can have beliefs that are different from their own.
So I'm going to show you a five-year-old
who is getting a standard kind of puzzle
that we call the false belief task.
And you know what pirates really like?
and he says, "Yum yum yum yum yum!
I really love cheese sandwiches."
And Ivan puts his sandwich over here, on top of the pirate chest.
And Ivan says, "You know what? I need a drink with my lunch."
And so Ivan goes to get a drink.
And while Ivan is away
the wind comes,
and it blows the sandwich down onto the grass.
And now, here comes the other pirate.
This pirate is called Joshua.
And Joshua also really loves cheese sandwiches.
So Joshua has a cheese sandwich and he says,
"Yum yum yum yum yum! I love cheese sandwiches."
And he puts his cheese sandwich over here on top of the pirate chest.
Ivan comes back and he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
So which one do you think Ivan is going to take?
Oh yeah, you were right. He took that one.
that other people can have false beliefs
and what the consequences are for their actions.
Now I'm going to show you a three-year-old
who got the same puzzle.
Which sandwich is he going to take?
Do you think he's going to take that one? Let's see what happens.
Let's see what he does. Here comes Ivan.
And he says, "I want my cheese sandwich."
And he takes this one.
Uh-oh. Why did he take that one?
First, he predicts Ivan will take the sandwich
that's really his.
And second, when he sees Ivan taking the sandwich where he left his,
where we would say he's taking that one because he thinks it's his,
the three-year-old comes up with another explanation:
He's not taking his own sandwich because he doesn't want it,
because now it's dirty, on the ground.
So that's why he's taking the other sandwich.
Now of course, development doesn't end at five.
And we can see the continuation of this process
of learning to think about other people's thoughts
by upping the ante
and asking children now, not for an action prediction,
but for a moral judgment.
So first I'm going to show you the three-year-old again.
to take Joshua's sandwich,
since he thinks Ivan only took Joshua's sandwich
to avoid having to eat his own dirty sandwich.
But now I'm going to show you the five-year-old.
Remember the five-year-old completely understood
why Ivan took Joshua's sandwich.
for taking Joshua's sandwich?
that we get what looks more like an adult response.
for switching the sandwiches.
(Laughter)
is to put children into the brain scanner
and ask what's going on in their brain
as they develop this ability to think about other people's thoughts.
So the first thing is that in children we see this same brain region, the Right TPJ,
being used while children are thinking about other people.
But it's not quite like the adult brain.
this brain region is almost completely specialized --
it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people's thoughts --
in children it's much less so,
when they are age five to eight,
the age range of the children I just showed you.
And actually if we even look at eight to 11-year-olds,
getting into early adolescence,
they still don't have quite an adult-like brain region.
And so, what we can see is that over the course of childhood
and even into adolescence,
both the cognitive system,
our mind's ability to think about other minds,
and the brain system that supports it
are continuing, slowly, to develop.
even in adulthood,
people differ from one another in how good they are
at thinking of other minds, how often they do it
and how accurately.
And so what we wanted to know was, could differences among adults
in how they think about other people's thoughts
be explained in terms of differences in this brain region?
So, the first thing that we did is we gave adults a version
of the pirate problem that we gave to the kids.
And I'm going to give that to you now.
and they take a break for coffee.
And Grace's friend asks for some sugar in her coffee.
Grace goes to make the coffee
and finds by the coffee a pot
containing a white powder, which is sugar.
But the powder is labeled "Deadly Poison,"
so Grace thinks that the powder is a deadly poison.
And she puts it in her friend's coffee.
And her friend drinks the coffee, and is fine.
for Grace to put the powder in the coffee?
Okay. Good. (Laughter)
So we ask people, how much should Grace be blamed
in this case, which we call a failed attempt to harm?
where everything in the real world is the same.
The powder is still sugar, but what's different is what Grace thinks.
Now she thinks the powder is sugar.
And perhaps unsurprisingly, if Grace thinks the powder is sugar
and puts it in her friend's coffee,
people say she deserves no blame at all.
Whereas if she thinks the powder was poison, even though it's really sugar,
now people say she deserves a lot of blame,
even though what happened in the real world was exactly the same.
in this case, the failed attempt to harm,
than in another case,
which we call an accident.
Where Grace thought the powder was sugar,
because it was labeled "sugar" and by the coffee machine,
but actually the powder was poison.
So even though when the powder was poison,
the friend drank the coffee and died,
people say Grace deserves less blame in that case,
when she innocently thought it was sugar,
than in the other case, where she thought it was poison
and no harm occurred.
about exactly how much blame Grace should get
in the accident case.
Some people think she should deserve more blame,
and other people less.
And what I'm going to show you is what happened when we look inside
the brains of people while they're making that judgment.
So what I'm showing you, from left to right,
is how much activity there was in this brain region,
and from top to bottom, how much blame
people said that Grace deserved.
when there was very little activity in this brain region,
people paid little attention to her innocent belief
and said she deserved a lot of blame for the accident.
Whereas on the right, where there was a lot of activity,
people paid a lot more attention to her innocent belief,
and said she deserved a lot less blame
for causing the accident.
what we'd rather is have a way to interfere
with function in this brain region,
and see if we could change people's moral judgment.
And we do have such a tool.
It's called Trans-Cranial Magnetic Stimulation,
or TMS.
This is a tool that lets us pass a magnetic pulse
through somebody's skull, into a small region of their brain,
and temporarily disorganize the function of the neurons in that region.
First, I'm going to show you that this is a magnetic pulse.
I'm going to show you what happens when you put a quarter on the machine.
When you hear clicks, we're turning the machine on.
So now I'm going to apply that same pulse to my brain,
to the part of my brain that controls my hand.
So there is no physical force, just a magnetic pulse.
by putting a magnetic pulse in my brain.
And we can use that same pulse,
now applied to the RTPJ,
to ask if we can change people's moral judgments.
So these are the judgments I showed you before, people's normal moral judgments.
And then we can apply TMS to the RTPJ
and ask how people's judgments change.
And the first thing is, people can still do this task overall.
remain the same. They say she deserves no blame.
But in the case of a failed attempt to harm,
where Grace thought that it was poison, although it was really sugar,
people now say it was more okay, she deserves less blame
for putting the powder in the coffee.
but it was really poison and so she caused a death,
people say that it was less okay, she deserves more blame.
So what I've told you today is that
people come, actually, especially well equipped
to think about other people's thoughts.
that lets us think about what other people are thinking.
This system takes a long time to develop,
slowly throughout the course of childhood and into early adolescence.
And even in adulthood, differences in this brain region
can explain differences among adults
in how we think about and judge other people.
and to Philip Roth, who ended by saying,
"The fact remains that getting people right
is not what living is all about anyway.
It's getting them wrong that is living.
Getting them wrong and wrong and wrong,
and then on careful reconsideration,
getting them wrong again."
Thank you.
(Applause)
magnetic pulses to change people's moral judgments,
that sounds alarming.
(Laughter)
Please tell me that you're not taking phone calls from the Pentagon, say.
I mean, they're calling, but I'm not taking the call.
(Laughter)
So then seriously,
you must lie awake at night sometimes
wondering where this work leads.
I mean, you're clearly an incredible human being,
but someone could take this knowledge
and in some future
not-torture chamber,
do acts that people here might be worried about.
So, there's a couple of things to say about TMS.
One is that you can't be TMSed without knowing it.
So it's not a surreptitious technology.
It's quite hard, actually, to get those very small changes.
The changes I showed you are impressive to me
because of what they tell us about the function of the brain,
but they're small on the scale
of the moral judgments that we actually make.
moral judgments when they're deciding what to do,
when they're making action choices.
We changed their ability to judge other people's actions.
And so, I think of what I'm doing not so much as
studying the defendant in a criminal trial,
but studying the jury.
in education, to perhaps bring up
a generation of kids able to make fairer moral judgments?
The whole research program here of studying
the distinctive parts of the human brain is brand new.
Until recently, what we knew about the brain
were the things that any other animal's brain could do too,
so we could study it in animal models.
We knew how brains see, and how they control the body
and how they hear and sense.
And the whole project of understanding
how brains do the uniquely human things --
learn language and abstract concepts,
and thinking about other people's thoughts -- that's brand new.
And we don't know yet what the implications will be
of understanding it.
the hard problem of consciousness,
that puzzles a lot of people.
The notion that you can understand
why a brain works, perhaps.
But why does anyone have to feel anything?
Why does it seem to require these beings who sense things
for us to operate?
You're a brilliant young neuroscientist.
I mean, what chances do you think there are
that at some time in your career,
someone, you or someone else,
is going to come up with some paradigm shift
in understanding what seems an impossible problem?
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Today I want to talk to you about
swimming across the North Pole,
across the most northern place in the whole world.
And perhaps the best place to start is with my late father.
He was a great storyteller.
He could tell a story about an event,
and so you felt you were absolutely there at the moment.
And one of the stories he told me so often when I was a young boy
was of the first British atomic bomb test.
He had been there and watched it go off.
and the light was so intense,
that he actually had to put his hands in front of his face to protect his eyes.
And he said that he could actually see an x-ray
of his fingers,
because the light was so bright.
And I know that watching that atomic bomb going off
had a very, very big impact on my late father.
Every holiday I had as a young boy
was in a national park.
What he was trying to do with me was to inspire me
to protect the world,
and show me just how fragile the world is.
He loved history. He would tell me about Captain Scott
walking all the way to the South Pole
and Sir Edmund Hillary climbing up Mount Everest.
And so ever since I think I was just six years old,
I dreamed of going to the polar regions.
I really, really wanted to go to the Arctic.
There was something about that place
which drew me to it.
And, well, sometimes it takes a long time
for a dream to come true.
But seven years ago, I went to the Arctic
for the first time.
And it was so beautiful that I've been back there
ever since, for the last seven years.
I love the place.
beyond all description,
just in that short period of time.
I have seen polar bears walking across very, very thin ice
in search of food.
I have swum in front of glaciers
which have retreated so much.
And I have also, every year,
seen less and less sea ice.
And I wanted the world to know what was happening up there.
23 percent of the arctic sea ice cover
just melted away.
And I wanted to really shake the lapels of world leaders
to get them to understand what is happening.
So I decided to do this symbolic swim
at the top of the world, in a place which should be frozen over,
but which now is rapidly unfreezing.
And the message was very clear:
Climate change is for real,
and we need to do something about it.
And we need to do something about it right now.
it's not an ordinary thing to do.
I mean, just to put it in perspective,
27 degrees is the temperature of a normal indoor swimming pool.
This morning, the temperature of the English Channel was 18 degrees.
The passengers who fell off the Titanic
fell into water of just five degrees centigrade.
Fresh water freezes at zero.
And the water at the North Pole is minus 1.7.
It's fucking freezing.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I'm sorry, but there is no other way to describe it.
(Laughter)
to help me with this task.
I assembled this team of 29 people from 10 nations.
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport,
you just dive into the sea and off you go.
It couldn't be further from the truth for me.
And I then went and did a huge amount of training,
swimming in icy water, backwards and forwards.
to prepare myself for what was going to happen.
And I had to visualize the swim.
I had to see it from the beginning all the way to the end.
I had to taste the salt water in my mouth.
I had to see my coach screaming for me,
"Come on Lewis! Come on! Go! Go! Go! Don't slow down!"
And so I literally swam across the North Pole
hundreds and hundreds of times in my mind.
I felt confident that I could actually
do this swim.
So myself and the five members of the team,
we hitched a ride on an icebreaker
which was going to the North Pole.
And on day four, we decided to just do a quick
five minute test swim.
I had never swum in water of minus 1.7 degrees before,
because it's just impossible to train
in those types of conditions.
So we stopped the ship, as you do.
We all got down onto the ice,
and I then got into my swimming costume
and I dived into the sea.
like that moment.
I could barely breathe. I was gasping for air.
I was hyperventilating so much,
and within seconds my hands were numb.
And it was -- the paradox is
that you're in freezing cold water,
but actually you're on fire.
I swam as hard as I could for five minutes.
I remember just trying to get out of the water.
I climbed out of the ice.
And I remember taking the goggles off my face
and looking down at my hands in sheer shock,
because my fingers
had swollen so much that they were like sausages.
And they were swollen so much, I couldn't even close them.
and when water freezes it expands.
And so what had actually happened is
that the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded.
And they had burst. And I was in so much agony.
I immediately got rushed onto the ship and into a hot shower.
and trying to defrost my fingers.
And I thought, in two days' time, I was going to do this swim across the North Pole.
I was going to try and do a 20-minute swim,
for one kilometer across the North Pole.
And this dream which I had had ever since I was a young boy
with my father, was just going out the window.
There is no possibility that this was going to happen.
And I remember then getting out of the shower
and realizing I couldn't even feel my hands.
And for a swimmer, you need to feel your hands
because you need to be able to grab the water
and pull it through with you.
and I was in such a state of depression,
and all I could think about was Sir Ranulph Fiennes.
For those of you who don't know him, he's the great British explorer.
A number of years ago, he tried to ski all the way to the North Pole.
He accidentally fell through the ice into the sea.
And after just three minutes in that water,
he was able
to get himself out.
And his hands were so badly frostbitten
that he had to return to England.
He went to a local hospital and there they said,
"Ran, there is no possibility
of us being able to save these fingers.
We are going to actually have to take them off."
And Ran decided to go into his tool shed
and take out a saw
and do it himself.
and I can't feel my hands after five minutes,
what on earth is going to happen if I try 20 minutes?
At the very best, I'm going to end up losing some fingers.
And at worst, I didn't even want to think about it.
We carried on sailing through the ice packs towards the North Pole.
and he came up to me and he said, "Lewis,
I've known you since you were 18 years old.
I've known you, and I know, Lewis,
deep down, right deep down here,
that you are going to make this swim.
I so believe in you Lewis. I've seen the way you've been training.
And I realize the reason why you're going to do this.
This is such an important swim.
We stand at a very, very important moment in this history,
and you're going to make a symbolic swim here
to try to shake the lapels of world leaders.
Lewis, have the courage to go in there,
because we are going to look after you every moment of it."
because he knew me so well.
So we carried on sailing and we arrived at the North Pole.
And we stopped the ship,
and it was just as the scientists had predicted.
There were open patches of sea everywhere.
And I went down into my cabin
and I put on my swimming costume.
And then the doctor strapped on a chest monitor,
which measures my core body temperature
and my heart rate.
And then we walked out onto the ice.
and there were big chunks of white ice in there,
and the water was completely black.
I had never seen black water before.
And it is 4,200 meters deep.
And I said to myself, "Lewis, don't look left, don't look right.
Just scuttle forward and go for it."
And so I now want to show you a short video
of what happened there on the ice.
when one can have a bit of a wobble mentally.
Everything just looks so gray around here,
and looks so cold.
We've just seen our first polar bears.
It was absolutely magical.
A mother and a cub, such a beautiful sight.
And to think that in 30, 40 years
they could become extinct.
It's a very frightening, very, very frightening thought.
We're finally at the North Pole. This is
months and months and months of dreaming to get here,
years of training and planning and preparation.
Ooh. In a couple of hours' time I'm going to get in here and do my swim.
It's all a little bit frightening,
and emotional.
Amundson, you ready? Amudson: Ready.
Lewis Pugh: Ten seconds to swim. Ten seconds to swim.
Take the goggles off. Take the goggles off!
Well done lad! You did it! You did it Lewis!
You did it! You did it man!
(Applause)
Thank you so much.
(Laughter)
It took me four months again to feel my hands.
But was it worth it? Yes, absolutely it was.
There are very, very few people who don't know now
about what is happening in the Arctic.
And people ask me, "Lewis, what can we do about climate change?"
I think we need to do three things.
The first thing we need to do is we need to break this problem down
into manageable chunks.
You saw during that video all those flags.
Those flags represented the countries
from which my team came from.
And equally, when it comes to climate change,
every single country is going to have to make cuts.
Britain, America, Japan,
South Africa, the Congo.
All of us together, we're all on the same ship together.
we need to just look back
at how far we have come
in such a short period of time.
I remember, just a few years ago, speaking about climate change,
and people heckling me in the back
and saying it doesn't even exist.
I've just come back from giving a series of speeches
in some of the poorest townships in South Africa
to young children as young as 10 years old.
Four or five children sitting behind a desk,
and even in those poorest conditions,
they all have a very, very good grasp
of climate change.
Now is the time to believe.
We've come a long way. We're doing good.
But the most important thing we must do
is, I think, we must all walk to the end of our lives
and turn around, and ask ourselves a most fundamental question.
And that is, "What type of world do we want to live in,
and what decision are we going to make today
to ensure that we all live
in a sustainable world?"
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very, very much.
(Applause)
Most of the time, art and science stare at each other
across a gulf of mutual incomprehension.
Art, of course, looks at the world through the psyche,
the emotions -- the unconscious at times -- and of course the aesthetic.
Science tends to look at the world through the rational, the quantitative --
things that can be measured and described --
but it gives art a terrific context of understanding.
we're dedicated to bringing those two parts of human understanding together,
to merging the art and science
to the end of helping us understand nature
and humanity's relationship with nature better.
Specifically, I as a person
who's been a professional nature photographer my whole adult life,
am firmly of the belief that photography, video, film
have tremendous powers for helping us understand
and shape the way we think about nature
and about ourselves in relationship to nature.
I'm fascinated by the beauty of it, the mutability of it,
the malleability of it,
and the fabulous shapes in which it can carve itself.
These first images are from Greenland.
But ice has another meaning.
Ice is the canary in the global coal mine.
It's the place where we can see and touch and hear and feel climate change in action.
Whether or not you believe in it is based on your sense of
is it raining more or is it raining less?
Is it getting hotter or is it getting colder?
What do the computer models say about this, that and the other thing?
All of that, strip it away. In the world of the arctic and alpine environments,
where the ice is, it's real and it's present.
The changes are happening. They're very visible.
They're photographable. They're measurable.
That's outside Antarctica.
95 percent of the glaciers in the world are retreating or shrinking,
and that's because the precipitation patterns and the temperature patterns are changing.
There is no significant scientific dispute about that.
It's been observed, it's measured, it's bomb-proof information.
And the great irony and tragedy of our time
is that a lot of the general public thinks that science is still arguing about that.
Science is not arguing about that.
In these images we see ice from enormous glaciers,
ice sheets that are hundreds of thousands of years old
breaking up into chunks, and chunk by chunk by chunk,
iceberg by iceberg, turning into global sea level rise.
I was still a skeptic about climate change until about 10 years ago,
because I thought the story of climate change was based on computer models.
I hadn't realized it was based on concrete measurements
of what the paleoclimates -- the ancient climates -- were,
as recorded in the ice sheets, as recorded in deep ocean sediments,
as recorded in lake sediments, tree rings,
and a lot of other ways of measuring temperature.
I decided that one day I would do a project
looking at trying to manifest climate change photographically.
And that led me to this project.
Initially, I was working on a National Geographic assignment --
conventional, single frame, still photography.
And one crazy day, I got the idea that I should --
after that assignment was finished --
I got the idea that I should shoot in time-lapse photography,
that I should station a camera or two at a glacier
and let it shoot every 15 minutes, or every hour or whatever
and watch the progression of the landscape over time.
I incautiously turned that idea of a couple of time-lapse cameras
into 25 time-lapse cameras.
And the next six months of my life were the hardest time in my career,
trying to design, build and deploy out in the field these 25 time-lapse cameras.
They are powered by the sun. Solar panels power them.
Power goes into a battery. There is a custom made computer
that tells the camera when to fire.
And these cameras are positioned on rocks on the sides of the glaciers,
and they look in on the glacier from permanent, bedrock positions,
and they watch the evolution of the landscape.
We just had a number of cameras out on the Greenland Ice Sheet.
We actually drilled holes into the ice, way deep down below the thawing level,
and had some cameras out there for the past month and a half or so.
Actually, there's still a camera out there right now.
In any case, the cameras shoot roughly every hour.
Some of them shoot every half hour, every 15 minutes, every five minutes.
(Laughter)
I personally obsessed about every nut, bolt and washer in these crazy things.
I spent half my life at our local hardware store
during the months when we built these units originally.
Our time-lapse units are in Alaska, the Rockies, Greenland and Iceland,
and we have repeat photography positions,
that is places we just visit on an annual basis,
in British Columbia, the Alps and Bolivia.
as an ambassador for my whole team.
There's a lot of people working on this right now.
We've got 33 cameras out this moment.
We just had 33 cameras shoot about half an hour ago
all across the northern hemisphere, watching what's happened.
And we've spent a lot of time in the field. It's been a fantastic amount of work.
We've been out for two and a half years,
and we've got about another two and a half years yet to go.
The other half of our job is to tell the story to the global public.
You know, scientists have collected this kind of information
off and on over the years, but a lot of it stays within the science community.
Similarly, a lot of art projects stay in the art community,
and I feel very much a responsibility through mechanisms like TED,
and like our relationship with the Obama White House,
with the Senate, with John Kerry, to influence policy
as much as possible with these pictures as well.
We've done films. We've done books. We have more coming.
We have a site on Google Earth
that Google Earth was generous enough to give us,
and so forth, because we feel very much the need to tell this story,
because it is such an immediate evidence of ongoing climate change right now.
If everybody in the developed world understood this graph,
and emblazoned it on the inside of their foreheads,
there would be no further societal argument about climate change
because this is the story that counts.
Everything else you hear is just propaganda and confusion.
Key issues: this is a 400,000 year record.
This exact same pattern is seen going back now
almost a million years before our current time.
And several things are important.
go up and down basically in sync.
You can see that from the orange line and the blue line.
Nature naturally has allowed carbon dioxide to go up to 280 parts per million.
That's the natural cycle.
Goes up to 280 and then drops
for various reasons that aren't important to discuss right here.
But 280 is the peak.
Right now, if you look at the top right part of that graph,
we're at 385 parts per million.
We are way, way outside the normal, natural variability.
Earth is having a fever.
In the past hundred years, the temperature of the Earth
has gone up 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit, .75 degrees Celsius,
and it's going to keep going up
because we keep dumping fossil fuels into the atmosphere.
At the rate of about two and a half parts per million per year.
It's been a remorseless, steady increase.
That's the crux, and someday I hope to emblazon that
across Times Square in New York and a lot of other places.
But anyway, off to the world of ice.
This is a view of what's called the calving face.
This is what one of our cameras saw over the course of a few months.
You see the glacier flowing in from the right,
dropping off into the sea, camera shooting every hour.
If you look in the middle background,
you can see the calving face bobbing up and down like a yo-yo.
That means that glacier's floating and it's unstable,
and you're about to see the consequences of that floating.
To give you a little bit of a sense of scale,
that calving face in this picture
is about 325 feet tall. That's 32 stories.
This is not a little cliff. This is like a major office building in an urban center.
The calving face is the wall where the visible ice breaks off,
but in fact, it goes down below sea level another couple thousand feet.
So there's a wall of ice a couple thousand feet deep
going down to bedrock if the glacier's grounded on bedrock,
and floating if it isn't.
This was an aerial picture I did one day in June three years ago.
This is an aerial picture we did this year.
That's the retreat of this glacier.
The main stem, the main flow of the glacier is coming from the right
and it's going very rapidly up that stem.
We're going to be up there in just a few more weeks,
and we expect that it's probably retreated another half a mile,
but if I got there and discovered that it had collapsed
and it was five miles further back, I wouldn't be the least bit surprised.
because as the glaciers --
one of the things is that places like Alaska and Greenland are huge,
they're not normal landscapes --
but as the glaciers are retreating, they're also deflating,
like air is being let out of a balloon.
And so, there are features on this landscape.
There's a ridge right in the middle of the picture, up above where that arrow comes in,
that shows you that a little bit.
There's a marker line called the trim line
above our little red illustration there.
This is something no self-respecting photographer would ever do --
you put some cheesy illustration on your shot, right? --
and yet you have to do it sometimes to narrate these points.
But, in any case, the deflation of this glacier since 1984
has been higher than the Eiffel Tower, higher than the Empire State Building.
as it's retreated and deflated, gone back up valley.
These changes in the alpine world are accelerating.
It's not static.
Particularly in the world of sea ice,
the rate of natural change is outstripping predictions of just a few years ago,
and the processes either are accelerating
or the predictions were too low to begin with.
But in any case, there are big, big changes happening as we speak.
And you see where it ended in these various spring days,
June, May, then October.
Now we turn on our time lapse.
This camera was shooting every hour.
Geologic process in action here.
And everybody says, well don't they advance in the winter time?
No. It was retreating through the winter because it's an unhealthy glacier.
Finally catches up to itself, it advances.
because there's such a strange, bizarre fascination in seeing
these things you don't normally get to see come alive.
We've been talking about "seeing is believing "
and seeing the unseen at TED Global.
That's what you see with these cameras.
The images make the invisible visible.
These huge crevasses open up.
These great ice islands break off --
and now watch this.
This has been the springtime this year --
a huge collapse. That happened in about a month,
the loss of all that ice.
way out on the left, and that's where we were a few months ago, the
last time we went into Columbia.
To give you a feeling for the scale of the retreat,
we did another cheesy illustration,
with British double-decker buses.
If you line up 295 of those nose to tail, that's about how far back that was.
It's a long way.
One of my favorite glaciers, the Sólheimajökull.
And here, if you watch, you can see the terminus retreating.
You can see this river being formed.
You can see it deflating.
Without the photographic process, you would never see this. This is invisible.
You can stand up there your whole life and you would never see this,
but the camera records it.
We go back a couple years in time.
That's where it started.
That's where it ended a few months ago.
The smaller the ice mass, the faster it responds to climate.
Greenland took a little while to start reacting
to the warming climate of the past century,
but it really started galloping along about 20 years ago.
And there's been a tremendous increase in the temperature up there.
All those colors are ice and it goes up to about two miles thick,
just a gigantic dome that comes in from the coast and rises in the middle.
The one glacier up in Greenland
that puts more ice into the global ocean
than all the other glaciers in the northern hemisphere combined
is the Ilulissat Glacier.
watching the calving face as it goes through this dramatic retreat.
Here's a two-year record of what that looks like.
Helicopter in front of the calving face for scale, quickly dwarfed.
The calving face is four and a half miles across,
and in this shot, as we pull back, you're only seeing about a mile and a half.
So, imagine how big this is
and how much ice is charging out.
The interior of Greenland is to the right.
It's flowing out to the Atlantic Ocean on the left.
Icebergs, many, many, many, many times the size of this building, are roaring out to sea.
as you can see. June 25th,
monster calving events happened.
I'll show you one of those in a second.
It now goes at 125 feet a day, dumping all this ice into the ocean.
It tends to go in these pulses, about every three days,
but on average, 125 feet a day,
twice the rate it did 20 years ago.
and we recorded the biggest calving event that's ever been put on film.
We had nine cameras going.
This is what a couple of the cameras saw.
A 400-foot-tall calving face breaking off.
Huge icebergs rolling over.
Okay, how big was that? It's hard to get it.
So an illustration again, gives you a feeling for scale.
A mile of retreat in 75 minutes
across the calving face, in that particular event, three miles wide.
The block was three-fifths of a mile deep,
and if you compare the expanse of the calving face
to the Tower Bridge in London, about 20 bridges wide.
Or if you take an American reference, to the U.S. Capitol Building
and you pack 3,000 Capitol Buildings into that block,
it would be equivalent to how large that block was.
75 minutes.
after spending a lot of time in this climate change world
that we don't have a problem of economics, technology and public policy.
We have a problem of perception.
The policy and the economics and the technology are serious enough issues,
but we actually can deal with them.
I'm certain that we can.
But what we have is a perception problem
because not enough people really get it yet.
You're an elite audience. You get it.
Fortunately, a lot of the political leaders in the major countries of the world
are an elite audience that for the most part gets it now.
But we still need to bring a lot of people along with us.
And that's where I think organizations like TED,
like the Extreme Ice Survey can have a terrific impact
on human perception and bring us along.
Because I believe we have an opportunity right now.
but we still have an opportunity to face the greatest challenge
of our generation and, in fact, of our century.
This is a terrific, terrific call to arms
to do the right thing for ourselves and for the future.
I hope that we have the wisdom to let the angels of our better nature
rise to the occasion and do what needs to be done. Thank you.
I'm a creative technologist
and the focus of my work is on public installations.
One of my driving passions
is this idea of exploring nature,
and trying to find hidden data within nature.
It seems to me that there is
this latent potential everywhere, all around us.
Everything gives out some kind of data,
whether it's sound or smell or vibration.
Through my work, I've been
trying to find ways to harness and unveil this.
And so this basically led me to
a subject called cymatics.
Now, cymatics is the process of visualizing sound
by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water,
as you can see there.
beginning with the observations of resonance,
by Da Vinci, Galileo, the English scientist Robert Hook
and then Ernest Chladni.
He created an experiment using a metal plate,
covering it with sand and then bowing it
to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right.
was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s.
He actually coined the term cymatics.
Then bringing us into the present day
is a fellow collaborator of mine
and cymatics expert, John Stewart Reed.
He's kindly recreated for us
the Chladni experiment.
What we can see here is
the metal sheet, this time connected to a sound driver
and being fed by a frequency generator.
As the frequencies increase,
so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate.
As you can see with your own eyes.
(Applause)
Well, for me cymatics is an almost magical tool.
It's like a looking glass into a hidden world.
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics,
we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen.
Devices like the cymascope, which you can see here,
have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns.
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day.
a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created
by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit.
And hopefully in the future we'll be able to gain some deeper understanding
of how they communicate.
We can also use cymatics for healing and education.
This is an installation developed with school children,
where their hands are tracked. It allows them
to control and position cymatic patterns
and the reflections that are caused by them.
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form.
of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device.
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit.
This is Pink Floyd's "Machine"
playing in real time through the cymascope.
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature.
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature.
So, for example, here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature.
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake.
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish.
And there is thousands of these.
Well, there is still a lot to explore
in its early days. And there's not many people working in this field.
But consider for a moment that sound does have form.
We've seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter.
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming.
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming.
And if we kind of ponder on that, then perhaps
cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself.
DIY scientists and artists
from all over the globe.
Cymatics is accessible to everybody.
I want to urge everybody here to
apply your passion, your knowledge
and your skills to areas like cymatics.
I think collectively we can build a global community.
We can inspire each other.
And we can evolve this exploration
of the substance of things not seen. Thank you.
(Applause)
It's hard to believe that it's less than a year since the extraordinary moment
when the finance, the credit, which drives our economies froze.
A massive cardiac arrest.
The effect, the payback, perhaps, for years of vampire predators like Bernie Madoff,
whom we saw earlier.
Abuse of steroids, binging and so on.
And it's only a few months since governments
injected enormous sums of money to try and keep the whole system afloat.
And we're now in a very strange sort of twilight zone,
where no one quite knows what's worked, or what doesn't.
We don't have any very clear maps, any compass to guide us.
We don't know which experts to believe anymore.
to what I think is the landscape on the other side of the crisis,
what things we should be looking out for
and how we can actually use the crisis.
There's a definition of leadership which says,
"It's the ability to use the smallest possible crisis
for the biggest possible effect."
And I want to talk about how we ensure that this crisis,
which is by no means small, really is used to the full.
I've got a very confused background
which perhaps makes me appropriate for confused times.
I've got a Ph.D. in Telecoms, as you can see.
I trained briefly as a Buddhist monk under this guy.
I've been a civil servant,
and I've been in charge of policy for this guy as well.
And then as now, it was a beautiful place of balls and punts, beautiful people,
many of whom took to heart Ronald Reagan's comment
that, "even if they say hard work doesn't do you any harm,
why risk it?"
a lot of my fellow teenagers were in a very different situation,
leaving school at a time then of rapidly growing youth unemployment,
and essentially hitting a brick wall in terms of their opportunities.
And I spent quite a lot of time with them rather than in punts.
And they were people who were not short of wit, or grace or energy,
but they had no hope, no jobs, no prospects.
And when people aren't allowed to be useful,
they soon think that they're useless.
And although that was great for the music business at the time,
it wasn't much good for anything else.
And ever since then, I've wondered why it is that capitalism
is so amazingly efficient at some things, but so inefficient at others,
why it's so innovative in some ways and so un-innovative in others.
we've actually been through an extraordinary boom,
the longest boom ever in the history of this country.
Unprecedented wealth and prosperity,
but that growth hasn't always delivered what we needed.
H.L. Mencken once said that, "to every complex problem,
there is a simple solution and it's wrong."
But I'm not saying growth is wrong,
but it's very striking that throughout the years of growth,
many things didn't get better.
Rates of depression carried on up, right across the Western world.
If you look at America, the proportion of Americans
with no one to talk to about important things
went up from a tenth to a quarter.
We commuted longer to work, but as you can see from this graph,
the longer you commute the less happy you're likely to be.
And it became ever clearer that economic growth
doesn't automatically translate into social growth or human growth.
when another wave of teenagers are entering a cruel job market.
There will be a million unemployed young people here
by the end of the year,
thousands losing their jobs everyday in America.
We've got to do whatever we can to help them,
of whether we use this crisis to jump forward
to a different kind of economy that's more suited to human needs,
to a better balance of economy and society.
even the deepest crises can be moments of opportunity.
They bring ideas from the margins into the mainstream.
They often lead to the acceleration of much-needed reforms.
And you saw that in the '30s,
when the Great Depression paved the way
for Bretton Woods, welfare states and so on.
And I think you can see around us now,
some of the green shoots of a very different kind of economy and capitalism
which could grow.
You can see it in daily life.
When times are hard, people have to do things for themselves,
and right across the world, Oxford, Omaha, Omsk,
you can see an extraordinary explosion of urban farming,
people taking over land, taking over roofs,
turning barges into temporary farms.
I have 60,000 of these things in my garden.
A few of these. This is Atilla the hen.
And I'm a very small part of a very large movement,
which for some people is about survival,
but is also about values, about a different kind of economy,
which isn't so much about consumption and credit,
but about things which matter to us.
And everywhere too, you can see a proliferation of time banks
and parallel currencies,
people using smart technologies to link up
all the resources freed up by the market -- people, buildings, land --
and linking them to whomever has got the most compelling needs.
Ronald Reagan, again, said the two funniest sentences
in the English language are,
"I'm from the government. And I'm here to help."
But I think last year when governments did step in,
people were quite glad that they were there, that they did act.
But now, a few months on,
however good politicians are at swallowing frogs
without pulling a face, as someone once put it,
they can't hide their uncertainty.
Because it's already clear
how much of the enormous amount of money they put into the economy,
really went into fixing the past, bailing out the banks, the car companies,
not preparing us for the future.
How much of the money is going into concrete and boosting consumption,
not into solving the really profound problems we have to solve.
which are being spent of our money and our children's money,
Surely, we should be using this with a longer-term vision
to accelerate the shift to a green economy,
to prepare for aging, to deal with some of the inequalities
which scar countries like this and the United States
rather than just giving the money to the incumbents?
Surely, we should be giving the money to entrepreneurs, to civil society,
for people able to create the new,
not to the big, well-connected companies,
big, clunky government programs.
And, after all this, as the great Chinese sage Lao Tzu said,
"Governing a great country is like cooking a small fish.
Don't overdo it."
Why boost consumption, rather than change what we consume?
Like the mayor of São Paulo who's banned advertising billboards,
or the many cities like San Francisco
putting in infrastructures for electric cars.
You can see a bit of the same thing happening in the business world.
Some, I think some of the bankers
who have appear to have learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
But ask yourselves: What will be the biggest sectors of the economy
in 10, 20, 30 years time? It won't be the ones lining up for handouts,
like cars and aerospace and so on.
already 18 percent of the American economy,
predicted to grow to 30, even 40 percent by mid-century.
Elder care, child care, already much bigger employers than cars.
Education: six, seven, eight percent of the economy and growing.
Environmental services, energy services, the myriad of green jobs,
they're all pointing to a very different kind of economy
which isn't just about products, but is using distributed networks,
and it's founded above all on care, on relationships,
on what people do to other people, often one to one,
rather than simply selling them a product.
the challenge for governments and the challenge for business now
is, in a way, a very simple one, but quite a difficult one.
We know our societies have to radically change.
We know we can't go back to where we were before the crisis.
But we also know it's only through experiment
that we'll discover exactly how to run a low carbon city,
how to care for a much older population,
how to deal with drug addiction and so on.
In science, we do experiments systematically.
Our societies now spend two, three, four percent of GDP
to invest systematically in new discovery, in science, in technology,
to fuel the pipeline of brilliant inventions
which illuminate gatherings like this.
It's not that our scientists are necessarily much smarter
than they were a hundred years ago, maybe they are,
but they have a hell of a lot more backing than they ever did.
And what's striking though,
is that in society there's almost nothing comparable,
no comparable investment,
no systematic experiment, in the things capitalism isn't very good at,
like compassion, or empathy, or relationships or care.
who was then an 80-year-old, slightly shambolic man
who lived on tomato soup and thought ironing was very overrated.
He had helped shape Britain's post-war institutions,
its welfare state, its economy,
but had sort of reinvented himself as a social entrepreneur,
became an inventor of many, many different organizations.
Some famous ones like the Open University, which has 110,000 students,
the University of the Third Age, which has nearly half a million older people
teaching other older people,
as well as strange things like DIY garages and language lines
and schools for social entrepreneurs.
And he ended his life selling companies to venture capitalists.
you should act on it yourself, and he lived long enough
and saw enough of his ideas first scorned and then succeed
that he said you should always take no as a question and not as an answer.
And his life was a systematic experiment to find better social answers,
not from a theory, but from experiment, and experiment involving the people
with the best intelligence on social needs,
which were usually the people living with those needs.
And he believed we live with others, we share the world with others
and therefore our innovation must be done with others too,
not doing things at people, for them, and so on.
but I think it's rapidly becoming quite mainstream.
It's what we do in the organization named after him
where we try and invent, create, launch new ventures,
whether it's schools, web companies, health organizations and so on.
And we find ourselves part of a very rapidly growing global movement
of institutions working on social innovation,
using ideas from design or technology or community organizing
to develop the germs of a future world, but through practice and through demonstration
and not through theory.
And they're spreading from Korea to Brazil to India to the USA
and across Europe.
And they've been given new momentum by the crisis, by the need for better answers
to joblessness, community breakdown and so on.
These are complaints choirs.
People come together to sing about the things that really bug them.
(Laughter)
Others are much more pragmatic: health coaches, learning mentors, job clubs.
And some are quite structural, like social impact bonds
where you raise money to invest in diverting teenagers from crime
or helping old people keep out of hospital,
and you get paid back according to how successful your projects are.
I think, is rapidly becoming a common sense
and part of how we respond to the crisis,
recognizing the need to invest in innovation for social progress
as well as technological progress.
There were big health innovation funds
launched earlier this year in this country,
as well as a public service innovation lab.
Across northern Europe, many governments
now have innovation laboratories within them.
And just a few months ago, President Obama
launched the Office of Social Innovation in the White House.
Surely, just as we invest in R and D, two, three, four percent,
of our GDP, of our economy,
what if we put, let's say, one percent of public spending
into social innovation, into elder care, new kinds of education,
new ways of helping the disabled?
Perhaps we'd achieve similar productivity gains in society
to those we've had in the economy and in technology.
were ones like getting a man on the moon,
perhaps the challenges we need to set ourselves now
are ones like eliminating child malnutrition, stopping trafficking,
or one, I think closer to home for America or Europe,
why don't we set ourselves the goal
of achieving a billion extra years of life for today's citizens.
Now those are all goals which could be achieved within a decade,
but only with radical and systematic experiment,
not just with technologies, but also with lifestyles and culture
and policies and institutions too.
I think what this is all about, this whole movement
which is growing from the margins, remains quite small.
Nothing like the resources of a CERN or a DARPA or an IBM or a Dupont.
What it's telling us is that capitalism is going to become more social.
It's already immersed in social networks.
It will become more involved in social investment, and social care
and in industries where the value comes from what you do with others,
not just from what you sell to them,
and from relationships as well as from consumption.
But interestingly too, it implies a future where society learns a few tricks from capitalism
about how you embed the DNA of restless continual innovation
into society, trying things out and then growing and scaling the ones that work.
In recent years, a lot of intelligent people thought that capitalism had basically won.
History was over
and society would inevitably have to take second place to economy.
But I've been struck with a parallel in how people often talk about capitalism today
and how they talked about the monarchy 200 years ago,
just after the French Revolution and the restoration of the monarchy in France.
because it was rooted in human nature.
We were naturally deferential. We needed hierarchy.
Just as today, the enthusiasts of unrestrained capitalism
say it's rooted in human nature,
only now it's individualism, inquisitiveness, and so on.
Then monarchy had seen off its big challenger, mass democracy,
which was seen as a well-intentioned but doomed experiment,
just as capitalism has seen off socialism.
Even Fidel Castro now says that the only thing worse
than being exploited by multinational capitalism
is not being exploited by multinational capitalism.
And whereas then monarchies, palaces and forts dominated every city skyline
and looked permanent and confident,
today it's the gleaming towers of the banks which dominate every big city.
and string up every investment banker from the nearest lamppost,
though that might be quite tempting.
But I do think we're on the verge of a period when,
just as happened to the monarchy and, interestingly, the military too,
the central position of finance capital is going to come to an end,
and it's going to steadily move to the sides, the margins of our society,
transformed from being a master into a servant,
a servant to the productive economy and of human needs.
we will remember something very simple and obvious about capitalism,
which is that, unlike what you read in economics textbooks,
it's not a self-sufficient system.
It depends on other systems,
on ecology, on family, on community,
and if these aren't replenished, capitalism suffers too.
And our human nature isn't just selfish, it's also compassionate.
It's not just competitive, it's also caring.
Because of the depth of the crisis, I think we are at a moment of choice.
It will be worse at the end of this year,
quite possibly worse in a year's time than it is today.
But this is one of those very rare moments
when we have to choose whether we're just pedaling furiously
to get back to where we were a year or two ago,
and a very narrow idea of what the economy is for,
or whether this is a moment to jump ahead, to reboot
and to do some of the things we probably should have been doing anyway.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about one of the world's largest problems
and how it can be solved.
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses,
or you've had laser refractive surgery?
Now, unfortunately, there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly.
But it looks like -- I'm guessing -- that it'll be about 60 percent of the room
because that's roughly the fraction of developed world population
that have some sort of vision correction.
well, they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses --
the lowest estimate is 150 million people.
They also have an estimate of around a billion.
But in fact, I would argue that we've just done an experiment here and now,
which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear
is around half of any population.
And the problem of poor vision, is actually not just a health problem,
it's also an educational problem,
and it's an economic problem, and it's a quality of life problem.
The problem is, there aren't enough eye care professionals in the world
to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear
that we have in the developed world.
There are just way too few eye care professionals.
and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people
and that's the ratio in the U.K.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa.
In fact, there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa
where there's one optometrist for eight million of the population.
I came up with a solution to this problem,
and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this.
And the idea is you make eye glasses, and you adjust them yourself
and that solves the problem.
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses. I shall pop this in my pocket.
I'm short sighted. I look at the signs at the end, I can hardly see them.
So -- okay, I can now see that man running out there,
and I can see that guy running out there.
I've now made prescription eyewear to my prescription.
Next step in my process.
So, I've now made eye glasses to my prescription.
Okay, so I've made these glasses and ...
Okay, I've made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I've just ...
And I've now made some glasses. That's it.
In fact, this technology's been evolving.
I started working on it in 1985,
and it's been evolving very slowly.
There are about 30,000 in use now.
And they're in fifteen countries. They're spread around the world.
I have a global vision for vision.
And that vision is to try to get a billion people
wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020.
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology.
The technology is being further developed --
the cost has to be brought down.
This pair, in fact, these currently cost about 19 dollars.
But the cost has to be brought right down.
It has to be brought down because we're trying to serve populations
who live on a dollar a day.
You start to get into detail.
And on this slide, I'm basically explaining all the problems you have.
How do you distribute? How do you work out how to fit the thing?
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem?
How do you deal with the industry?
And the answer to that is research.
here in the university.
If you want to know more, just come have a look at our website. Thank you.
I've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now,
ever since I stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article
by a guy named Jack Harlan.
And he described the diversity within crops --
all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such --
as a genetic resource.
And he said, "This genetic resource," --
and I'll never forget the words --
"stands between us and catastrophic starvation
on a scale we cannot imagine."
or he was one of these academic nutcases.
So, I looked a little further,
and what I figured out was that he wasn't a nutcase.
He was the most respected scientist in the field.
What he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity --
is the biological foundation of agriculture.
It's the raw material, the stuff, of evolution in our agricultural crops.
Not a trivial matter.
And he also understood that that foundation was crumbling,
literally crumbling.
That indeed, a mass extinction was underway
in our fields, in our agricultural system.
And that this mass extinction was taking place
with very few people noticing
and even fewer caring.
to think about diversity in agricultural systems
and, let's face it, that's logical.
You don't see it in the newspaper every day.
And when you go into the supermarket, you certainly don't see a lot of choices there.
You see apples that are red, yellow, and green and that's about it.
Here's some beans,
and there are about 35 or 40 different
varieties of beans on this picture.
Now, imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another
about the same way as a poodle from a Great Dane.
If I wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world,
and I put 30 or 40 of them on a slide, it would take about 10 slides
because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world.
But there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans.
So if I were to going to show you all the beans in the world,
and I had a slide like this, and I switched it every second,
it would take up my entire TED talk,
and I wouldn't have to say anything.
that this diversity is being lost.
We have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat,
and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice,
but it's being lost.
And I want to give you an example of that.
It's a bit of a personal example, in fact.
In the United States, in the 1800s -- that's where we have the best data --
farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100
named varieties of apples.
Imagine that. 7,100 apples with names.
Today, 6,800 of those are extinct,
no longer to be seen again.
and when I would go out and give a presentation,
I would pass the list out in the audience.
I wouldn't tell them what it was, but it was in alphabetical order,
and I would tell them to look for their names, their family names,
their mother's maiden name.
And at the end of the speech, I would ask, "How many people have found a name?"
And I never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand.
And I said, "You know what? These apples come from your ancestors,
and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them.
They gave them their name.
The bad news is they're extinct.
The good news is a third of you didn't hold up your hand. Your apple's still out there.
Find it. Make sure it doesn't join the list."
that the Fowler apple is still out there.
And there's an old book back here,
and I want to read a piece from it.
This book was published in 1904.
It's called "The Apples of New York" and this is the second volume.
See, we used to have a lot of apples.
And the Fowler apple is described in here --
I hope this doesn't surprise you --
as, "a beautiful fruit."
(Laughter)
I don't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us, but ...
but, to be honest, the description goes on
and it says that it "doesn't rank high in quality, however."
And then he has to go even further.
It sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine.
"As grown in New York, the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality
and is, on the whole, unsatisfactory."
and the lesson is: so why save it?
I get this question all the time. Why don't we just save the best one?
And there are a couple of answers to that question.
One thing is that there is no such thing as a best one.
Today's best variety is tomorrow's lunch for insects or pests or disease.
The other thing is that maybe that Fowler apple
or maybe a variety of wheat that's not economical right now
has disease or pest resistance
or some quality that we're going to need for climate change that the others don't.
So it's not necessary, thank God,
that the Fowler apple is the best apple in the world.
It's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good, unique trait.
And for that reason, we ought to be saving it.
Why? As a raw material, as a trait we can use in the future.
Think of diversity as giving us options.
And options, of course, are exactly what we need in an era of climate change.
but first, I want to tell you that we've been working at the Global Crop Diversity Trust
with a number of scientists -- particularly at Stanford and University of Washington --
to ask the question: What's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change
and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops
to be able to adapt to this?
In short, the answer is that in the future, in many countries,
the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter
than anything those crops have seen in the past.
The coldest growing seasons of the future,
hotter than the hottest of the past.
Is agriculture adapted to that?
I don't know. Can fish play the piano?
If agriculture hasn't experienced that, how could it be adapted?
and the place where climate change, ironically, is going to be the worst
is in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
So I've picked two examples here, and I want to show you.
In the histogram before you now,
the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures,
going back about far as we have temperature data.
And you can see that there's some difference
between one growing season and another.
Some are colder, some are hotter and it's a bell shaped curve.
The tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons.
In the future, later this century, it's going to look like the red,
totally out of bounds.
The agricultural system and, more importantly, the crops in the field in India
have never experienced this before.
But the most interesting thing about South Africa is
we don't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble.
By 2030, if the maize, or corn, varieties, which is the dominant crop --
50 percent of the nutrition in Southern Africa are still in the field --
in 2030, we'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize
because of the climate change already in 2030.
30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population,
that's a food crisis. It's global in nature.
We will watch children starve to death on TV.
Now, you may say that 20 years is a long way off.
It's two breeding cycles for maize.
We have two rolls of the dice to get this right.
We have to get climate-ready crops in the field,
and we have to do that rather quickly.
We have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity,
agricultural diversity, mostly in the form of seed,
and we put it in seed banks, which is a fancy way of saying a freezer.
If you want to conserve seed for a long term
and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers,
you dry it and then you freeze it.
Unfortunately, these seed banks are located around the world in buildings
and they're vulnerable.
Disasters have happened. In recent years we lost the gene bank,
the seed bank in Iraq and Afghanistan. You can guess why.
In Rwanda, in the Solomon Islands.
And then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings,
financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures,
and all kinds of things, and every time something like this happens,
it means extinction. We lose diversity.
And I'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys.
I'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs:
actually losing it, never to be seen again.
and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility
that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of --
maybe not the most charismatic diversity.
You don't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear,
but it's very important diversity.
So we needed a really safe place, and we went quite far north to find it.
To Svalbard, in fact.
This is above mainland Norway. You can see Greenland there.
That's at 78 degrees north.
It's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane.
It's a remarkably beautiful landscape. I can't even begin to describe it to you.
It's otherworldly, beautiful.
We worked with the Norwegian government
and with the NorGen, the Norwegian Genetic Resources Program,
to design this facility.
What you see is an artist's conception of this facility,
which is built in a mountain in Svalbard.
The idea of Svalbard was that it's cold,
so we get natural freezing temperatures.
But it's remote. It's remote and accessible
so it's safe and we don't depend on mechanical refrigeration.
And this next picture shows it in context, in Svalbard.
And here's the front door of this facility.
When you open up the front door,
this is what you're looking at. It's pretty simple. It's a hole in the ground.
It's a tunnel, and you go into the tunnel,
chiseled in solid rock, about 130 meters.
There are now a couple of security doors, so you won't see it quite like this.
Again, when you get to the back, you get into an area that's really my favorite place.
I think of it as sort of a cathedral.
And I know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd, but ...
(Laughter)
Some of the happiest days of my life have been spent ...
(Laughter)
in this place there.
It's not very exciting, but if you know what's there, it's pretty emotional.
We have now about 425,000
samples of unique crop varieties.
There's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice
in this facility right now.
About a year from now, we'll have over half a million samples.
We're going up to over a million, and someday we'll basically have samples --
about 500 seeds --
of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state
in this facility.
This is a backup system for world agriculture.
It's a backup system for all the seed banks. Storage is free.
It operates like a safety deposit box.
Norway owns the mountain and the facility, but the depositors own the seed.
And if anything happens, then they can come back and get it.
This particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the United States,
of Canada, and an international institution from Syria.
is almost the only thing I can think of these days where countries,
literally, every country in the world --
because we have seeds from every country in the world --
all the countries of the world have gotten together
to do something that's both long term, sustainable and positive.
I can't think of anything else that's happened in my lifetime that way.
for climate change, for the water crisis.
Agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth.
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution
for those things, or the energy crisis, or world hunger, or peace in conflict.
I can't look you in the eyes and tell you that I have a simple solution for that,
but I can look you in the eyes and tell you that we can't solve any of those problems
if we don't have crop diversity.
Because I challenge you to think of an effective, efficient, sustainable
solution to climate change if we don't have crop diversity.
Because, quite literally, if agriculture doesn't adapt to climate change,
neither will we.
And if crops don't adapt to climate change, neither will agriculture,
neither will we.
There are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist
just for the existence value of it.
It is, I agree, a nice thing to do.
But it's a necessary thing to do.
So, in a very real sense, I believe that we, as an international community,
should get organized to complete the task.
The Svalbard Global Seed Vault is a wonderful gift
that Norway and others have given us,
but it's not the complete answer.
We need to collect the remaining diversity that's out there.
We need to put it into good seed banks
that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future.
We need to catalog it. It's a library of life,
but right now I would say we don't have a card catalog for it.
And we need to support it financially.
to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university,
we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat.
30 million dollars in an endowment would take care
of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever.
So we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms.
rice, potatoes, and the other crops,
we may, quite simply, end up saving ourselves.
I love theater.
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else
and look at life with a completely new perspective.
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.
The idea that in that room at that moment,
everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,
comes together.
At that moment, we transcend space and time together.
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.
And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,
and began developing "Upwake."
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,
a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,
stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.
he would have drawn three holes inside that box
and told you your sheep was inside.
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.
This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination
from head to paper to screen to life.
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,
clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,
sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.
Go from one world to another in a second.
I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity
and use metaphors to suggest ideas.
At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions
in high definition, live, on stage.
between theater and technology.
Let's start with technology.
(Fuse blowing)
All right. Let's start with theater.
(Laughter)
(Buzzing)
(Click, click, bang)
(Laughter)
(Applause)
Thank you.
I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage
which I interact with.
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.
I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,
what started as a one person show became a collaborative work
of nineteen most talented artists.
And here are some excerpts.
(Applause)
Thank you.
And in Austin, Texas,
I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:
Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.
I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me
they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.
And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality
in order to transport them into another.
Something happened along the way.
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,
and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.
as it is about taking theater out of its box.
As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,
then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.
It's as though you made something resonate within them.
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting
allows them to be themselves just a bit more.
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,
and I know theater can heal.
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.
I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors
be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.
I know theater unites us.
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,
tell various stories through different mediums.
And Zero wants to go to the moon.
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,
suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity
every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original,
but it's important, and it's important to participate.
It's a human and technological revolution.
It's motion and emotion.
It's information.
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.
It's happening.
The natural progression of science and art
finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.
There is a revolution in the way that we think,
in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,
our evolution.
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures
and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.
He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.
He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings
when they needed it the most.
In the science of today, we become artists.
In the art of today, we become scientists.
We design our world. We invent possibilities.
We teach, touch and move.
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents
to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.
(Ringing)
Thank you.
(Applause)
I'm going to talk about your mindset.
Does your mindset correspond to my dataset?
(Laughter)
If not, one or the other needs upgrading, isn't it?
and I listen to them in the coffee break,
they always talk about "we" and "them."
And when they come back into the lecture room
I ask them, "What do you mean with "we" and "them"?
"Oh, it's very easy. It's the western world and it's the developing world," they say.
"We learned it in college."
And what is the definition then? "The definition?
Everyone knows," they say.
So one girl said, very cleverly, "It's very easy.
Western world is a long life in a small family.
Developing world is a short life in a large family."
And I like that definition, because it enabled me
to transfer their mindset
into the dataset.
And here you have the dataset.
So, you can see that what we have on this axis here
is size of family. One, two, three, four, five
children per woman on this axis.
And here, length of life, life expectancy,
30, 40, 50.
Exactly what the students said was their concept about the world.
Whether the man and woman decide to have small family,
and take care of their kids, and how long they will live.
It's about the bathroom and the kitchen. If you have soap, water and food, you know,
you can live long.
And the students were right. It wasn't that the world consisted --
the world consisted here, of one set of countries over here,
which had large families and short life. Developing world.
And we had one set of countries up there
which was the western world.
They had small families and long life.
the amazing thing that has happened in the world during my lifetime.
Then the developing countries applied
soap and water, vaccination.
And all the developing world started to apply family planning.
And partly to USA who help to provide
technical advice and investment.
And you see all the world moves over to a two child family,
and a life with 60 to 70 years.
And you can see we still have Afghanistan down here.
We have Liberia. We have Congo.
So we have countries living there.
So the problem I had
is that the worldview that my students had
corresponds to reality in the world
the year their teachers were born.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
I was at the Global Health Conference here in Washington last week,
and I could see the wrong concept
even active people in United States had,
that they didn't realize the improvement
of Mexico there, and China, in relation to United States.
Look here when I move them forward.
Here we go.
They catch up. There's Mexico.
It's on par with United States in these two social dimensions.
There was less than five percent
of the specialists in Global Health that was aware of this.
This great nation, Mexico,
has the problem that arms are coming from North,
across the borders, so they had to stop that,
because they have this strange relationship to the United States, you know.
I would instead put income per person.
Income per person. I can put that here.
And we will then see
a completely different picture.
By the way, I'm teaching you
how to use our website, Gapminder World,
while I'm correcting this,
because this is a free utility on the net.
And when I now finally got it right,
I can go back 200 years in history.
And I can find United States up there.
And I can let the other countries be shown.
And now I have income per person on this axis.
And United States only had some, one, two thousand dollars at that time.
And the life expectancy was 35 to 40 years,
on par with Afghanistan today.
This is instead of studying history
for one year at university.
You can watch me for one minute now and you'll see the whole thing.
(Laughter)
You can see how the brown bubbles, which is west Europe,
and the yellow one, which is the United States,
they get richer and richer and also
start to get healthier and healthier.
And this is now 100 years ago,
where the rest of the world remains behind.
Here we come. And that was the influenza.
That's why we are so scared about flu, isn't it?
It's still remembered. The fall of life expectancy.
And then we come up. Not until
independence started.
you have India over there,
and this is what has happened.
Did you note there, that we have Mexico up there?
Mexico is not at all on par with the United States,
but they are quite close.
And especially, it's interesting to see
China and the United States
during 200 years,
because I have my oldest son now working for Google,
after Google acquired this software.
Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet
for many years and developed this.
And my youngest son, who studied Chinese in Beijing.
So they come in with the two perspectives I have, you know?
And my son, youngest son who studied in Beijing,
in China, he got a long-term perspective.
Whereas when my oldest son, who works for Google,
he should develop by quarter, or by half-year.
Or Google is quite generous, so he can have one or two years to go.
because they remember
the very embarrassing period, for 100 years,
when they went backwards.
And then they would remember the first part
of last century, which was really bad,
and we could go by this so-called Great Leap Forward.
But this was 1963.
Mao Tse-Tung eventually brought health to China,
and then he died, and then Deng Xiaoping started
this amazing move forward.
first grew the economy, and then gradually got rich?
Whereas China could get healthy much earlier,
because they applied the knowledge of education, nutrition,
and then also benefits of penicillin
and vaccines and family planning.
And Asia could have social development
before they got the economic development.
So to me, as a public health professor,
it's not strange that all these countries grow so fast now.
is the flat world of Thomas Friedman,
isn't it.
It's not really, really flat.
But the middle income countries --
and this is where I suggest to my students,
stop using the concept "developing world."
Because after all, talking about the developing world
is like having two chapters in the history of the United States.
and the other is about the past,
where you cover everything from Washington
to Eisenhower.
Because Washington to Eisenhower,
that is what we find in the developing world.
We could actually go to Mayflower
to Eisenhower,
and that would be put together into a developing world,
which is rightly growing its cities in a very amazing way,
which have great entrepreneurs,
but also have the collapsing countries.
Well, one way of trying is to see whether we could
look at income distribution.
This is the income distribution of peoples in the world,
from $1. This is where you have food to eat.
These people go to bed hungry.
And this is the number of people.
This is $10, whether you have a public or a private
health service system. This is where you can
provide health service for your family and school for your children,
and this is OECD countries:
Green, Latin America, East Europe.
This is East Asia, and the light blue there is South Asia.
It changed like this.
Can you see how it's growing? And how hundreds of millions
and billions is coming out of poverty in Asia?
And it goes over here?
And I come now, into projections,
but I have to stop at the door of Lehman Brothers there, you know, because --
(Laughter)
that's where the projections are not valid any longer.
Probably the world will do this.
and then it will continue forward like this.
But more or less, this is what will happen,
and we have a world which cannot be looked upon as divided.
with the United States as a leading power;
we have the emerging economies in the middle,
which provide a lot of the funding for the bailout;
and we have the low income countries here.
Yeah, this is a fact that from where the money comes,
they have been saving, you know, over the last decade.
And here we have the low income countries
where entrepreneurs are.
And here we have the countries in collapse and war,
like Afghanistan, Somalia, parts of Congo, Darfur.
We have all this at the same time.
in the developing world.
Because it's so different, what has happened there.
And that's why I suggest
a slightly different approach of what you would call it.
And you have huge differences within countries also.
I heard that your departments here were by regions.
Here you have Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia,
East Asia, Arab states,
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD.
And on this axis, GDP.
And on this, heath, child survival,
and it doesn't come as a surprise
that Africa south of Sahara is at the bottom.
into country bubbles,
the size of the bubbles here is the population.
Then you see Sierra Leone and Mauritius, completely different.
There is such a difference within Sub-Saharan Africa.
And I can split the others. Here is the South Asian,
Arab world.
Now all your different departments.
East Europe, Latin America, and OECD countries.
And here were are. We have a continuum in the world.
We cannot put it into two parts.
building, building countries.
It's Lincoln here, advancing them.
It's Eisenhower bringing modernity into the countries.
And then it's United States today, up here.
And we have countries all this way.
Now, this is the important thing
of understanding how the world has changed.
At this point I decided to make a pause.
(Laughter)
to convey a thanks to the U.S. taxpayers,
for Demographic Health Survey.
Many are not aware of -- no, this is not a joke.
This is very serious.
It is due to USA's continuous sponsoring
during 25 years of the very good methodology
for measuring child mortality
that we have a grasp of what's happening in the world.
(Applause)
And it is U.S. government at its best,
without advocacy, providing facts,
that it's useful for the society.
And providing data free of charge
on the internet, for the world to use. Thank you very much.
who compiled data with government money,
tax money, and then they sell it to add a little profit,
in a very inefficient, Gutenberg way.
(Applause)
But the people doing that at the World Bank
are among the best in the world.
And they are highly skilled professionals.
It's just that we would like to upgrade our international agencies
to deal with the world in the modern way, as we do.
And when it comes to free data and transparency,
United States of America is one of the best.
And that doesn't come easy from the mouth of a Swedish public health professor.
(Laughter)
And I'm not paid to come here, no.
what we can show with this data.
Look here. This is the world.
With income down there and child mortality.
And what has happened in the world?
Since 1950, during the last 50 years
we have had a fall in child mortality.
And it is the DHS that makes it possible to know this.
And we had an increase in income.
And the blue former developing countries
are mixing up with the former industrialized western world.
We have a continuum. But we still have, of course,
Congo, up there. We still have as poor countries
as we have had, always, in history.
And that's the bottom billion, where we've heard today
about a completely new approach to do it.
Well, MDG 4.
The United States has not been so eager
to use MDG 4.
But you have been the main sponsor that has enabled us to measure it,
because it's the only child mortality that we can measure.
And we used to say that it should fall four percent per year.
Let's see what Sweden has done.
We used to boast about fast social progress.
That's where we were, 1900.
1900, Sweden was there.
Same child mortality as Bangladesh had, 1990,
though they had lower income.
They started very well. They used the aid well.
They vaccinated the kids. They get better water.
And they reduced child mortality,
with an amazing 4.7 percent per year. They beat Sweden.
I run Sweden the same 16 year period.
against Egypt, 1990.
Here we go. Once again the USA is part of the reason here.
They get safe water, they get food for the poor,
and they get malaria eradicated.
5.5 percent. They are faster than the millennium development goal.
Brazil here has amazing social improvement
over the last 16 years,
and they go faster than Sweden.
This means that the world is converging.
The middle income countries,
the emerging economy, they are catching up.
They are moving to cities,
where they also get better assistance for that.
They say, "This is not fair,
because these countries had vaccines and antibiotics
that were not available for Sweden.
We have to do real-time competition."
Okay. I give you Singapore, the year I was born.
Singapore had twice the child mortality of Sweden.
It's the most tropical country in the world,
a marshland on the equator.
And here we go. It took a little time for them to get independent.
But then they started to grow their economy.
And they made the social investment. They got away malaria.
They got a magnificent health system
that beat both the U.S. and Sweden.
We never thought it would happen that they would win over Sweden!
(Applause)
These yellow are just about to be doing this.
These red are the countries that doesn't do it, and the policy has to be improved.
Not simplistic extrapolation.
We have to really find a way
of supporting those countries in a better way.
We have to respect the middle income countries
on what they are doing.
And we have to fact-base the whole way we look at the world.
The blue is Africa.
The size of the bubbles is how many are HIV affected.
You see the tragedy in South Africa there.
About 20 percent of the adult population are infected.
And in spite of them having quite a high income,
they have a huge number of HIV infected.
But you also see that there are African countries down here.
There is no such thing as an HIV epidemic in Africa.
There's a number, five to 10 countries in Africa
that has the same level as Sweden and United States.
And there are others who are extremely high.
in one of the best countries, with the most vibrant economy
in Africa and a good governance, Botswana.
They have a very high level. It's coming down.
But now it's not falling,
because there, with help from PEPFAR,
it's working with treatment. And people are not dying.
And you can see it's not that easy,
that it is war which caused this.
Because here, in Congo, there is war.
And here, in Zambia, there is peace.
If I split Tanzania in its income,
the richer 20 percent in Tanzania
has more HIV than the poorest one.
And it's really different within each country.
Look at the provinces of Kenya. They are very different.
And this is the situation you see.
It's not deep poverty. It's the special situation,
probably of concurrent sexual partnership
among part of the heterosexual population
in some countries, or some parts of countries,
in south and eastern Africa.
Make it a local issue. And do prevention at each place,
in the way it can be done there.
So to just end up,
there are things of suffering
in the one billion poorest, which we don't know.
Those who live beyond the cellphone,
those who have yet to see a computer,
those who have no electricity at home.
elucidating in Africa.
It's caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation.
It's similar to the pellagra epidemic in Mississippi in the '30s.
It's similar to other nutritional diseases.
It will never affect a rich person.
This is the epidemic in Mozambique. This is an epidemic in northern Tanzania.
You never heard about the disease.
But it's much more than Ebola
that has been affected by this disease.
Cause crippling throughout the world.
And over the last two years,
2,000 people has been crippled
in the southern tip of Bandundu region.
That used to be the illegal diamond trade,
from the UNITA-dominated area in Angola.
That has now disappeared,
and they are now in great economic problem.
And one week ago, for the first time,
there were four lines on the Internet.
and the great capacity
of people in the middle income countries
and in peaceful low income countries.
There is still mystery in one billion.
And we have to have more concepts
than just developing countries and developing world.
We need a new mindset. The world is converging,
but -- but -- but not the bottom billion.
They are still as poor as they've ever been.
It's not sustainable, and it will not happen around one superpower.
But you will remain
one of the most important superpowers,
and the most hopeful superpower, for the time to be.
And this institution
will have a very crucial role,
not for United States, but for the world.
So you have a very bad name,
State Department. This is not the State Department.
It's the World Department.
And we have a high hope in you. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Early visions of wireless power
actually were thought of by Nikola Tesla
basically about 100 years ago.
The thought that
you wouldn't want to transfer electric power wirelessly,
no one ever thought of that.
They thought, "Who would use it if you didn't?"
And so, in fact, he actually set about
doing a variety of things.
Built the Tesla coil. This tower was built
on Long Island back at the beginning of the 1900s.
And the idea was, it was supposed to be able to transfer power
anywhere on Earth.
We'll never know if this stuff worked. Actually, I think the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
took it down for security purposes,
sometime in the early 1900s.
is that we love this stuff so much.
I mean, think about how much we love this.
If you just walk outside, there are trillions of dollars
that have been invested in infrastructure around the world,
putting up wires to get power from where it's created
to where it's used.
The other thing is, we love batteries.
And for those of us that have an environmental element to us,
there is something like 40 billion
disposable batteries built every year
for power that, generally speaking,
is used within a few inches or a few feet
of where there is very inexpensive power.
I thought, "You know, I am from North America.
We do have a little bit of a reputation in the United States."
So I thought I'd better look it up first.
So definition number six is the North American
definition of the word "suck."
Wires suck, they really do.
Think about it. Whether that's you in that picture
or something under your desk.
The other thing is, batteries suck too.
And they really, really do.
Do you ever wonder what happens to this stuff?
40 billion of these things built.
This is what happens.
They fall apart, they disintegrate,
and they end up here.
the cost per kilowatt-hour
to supply battery power to something
is on the order of two to three hundred pounds.
Think about that.
The most expensive grid power in the world
is thousandths of that.
So fortunately, one of the other definitions
of "suck" that was in there, it does create a vacuum.
And nature really does abhor a vacuum.
was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT
actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance.
Basically they were able to light a 60 watt light bulb
at a distance of about two meters.
It got about 50 percent of the efficiency --
by the way, that's still a couple thousand times
more efficient than a battery would be, to do the same thing.
But were able to light that,
and do it very successfully.
This was actually the experiment. So you can see
the coils were somewhat larger.
The light bulb was a fairly simple task, from their standpoint.
waking up at night to the third night in a row
that his wife's cellphone was beeping
because it was running out of battery power.
And he was thinking, "With all the electricity that's out there in the walls,
why couldn't some of that just come into the phone so I could get some sleep?"
And he actually came up with this concept
of resonant energy transfer.
But inside a standard transformer are two coils of wire.
And those two coils of wire are really, really close to each other,
and actually do transfer power
magnetically and wirelessly, only over a very short distance.
was separate the coils in a transformer
to a greater distance than the size of those transformers
using this technology, which is not dissimilar
from the way an opera singer shatters a glass on the other side of the room.
It's a resonant phenomenon
for which he actually received a MacArthur Fellowship Award,
which is nicknamed the Genius Award,
last September, for his discovery.
Imagine a coil. For those of you that are engineers,
there's a capacitor attached to it too.
And if you can cause that coil to resonate,
what will happen is it will pulse
at alternating current frequencies --
at a fairly high frequency, by the way.
And if you can bring another device
close enough to the source,
that will only work at exactly that frequency,
you can actually get them to do what's called strongly couple,
and transfer magnetic energy between them.
And then what you do is, you start out with electricity,
turn it into magnetic field, take that magnetic field,
turn it back into electricity,
and then you can use it.
I mean, people are worried about cellphones being safe.
You know. What about safety?
The first thing is this is not a "radiative" technology.
It doesn't radiate.
There aren't electric fields here. It's a magnetic field.
It stays within either what we call the source,
or within the device.
And actually, the magnetic fields we're using
are basically about the same as the Earth's magnetic field.
We live in a magnetic field.
that it only transfers energy to things that work at exactly the same frequency.
And it's virtually impossible in nature to make that happen.
Then finally we have governmental bodies everywhere
that will regulate everything we do.
They've pretty much set field exposure limits,
which all of the things in the stuff I'll show you today
sort of sit underneath those guidelines.
Home electronics.
Those cords under your desk, I bet everybody here
has something that looks like that or those batteries.
There are industrial applications.
And then finally, electric vehicles.
These electric cars are beautiful.
But who is going to want to plug them in?
Imagine driving into your garage -- we've built a system to do this --
you drive into your garage, and the car charges itself,
because there is a mat on the floor that's plugged into the wall.
And it actually causes your car to charge safely and efficiently.
Then there's all kinds of other applications. Implanted medical devices,
where people don't have to die of infections anymore
if you can seal the thing up.
Credit cards, robot vacuum cleaners.
and show you, actually, how it works.
And what I'm going to do is to show you pretty much what's here.
You've got a coil.
That coil is connected to an R.F. amplifier
that creates a high-frequency oscillating magnetic field.
We put one on the back of the television set.
By the way, I do make it look a little bit easier than it is.
There's lots of electronics and secret sauce
and all kinds of intellectual property that go into it.
But then what's going to happen is, it will create a field.
It will cause one to get created
on the other side.
in about 10 seconds or so we should see it.
The 10 seconds actually are because we --
I don't know if any of you have ever thought about plugging a T.V. in
when you use just a cord.
Generally, you have to go over and hit the button. So I thought
we put a little computer in it that has to wake up
to tell it to do that.
So, I'll plug that in.
It creates a magnetic field here.
It causes one to be created out here.
And as I said, in sort of about 10 seconds
we should start to see ...
(Applause)
available color television set.
Imagine, you get one of these things. You want to hang them on the wall.
How many people want to hang them on the wall?
Think about it. You don't want those ugly cords coming down.
Imagine if you can get rid of it.
So, there is nothing going on. I'm okay.
And I'll do it again, just for safety's sake.
Almost immediately, though, people ask,
"How small can you make this? Can you make this small enough?"
Because remember Dr. Soljacic's original idea
was his wife's cellphone beeping.
We're an equal opportunity designer of this sort of thing.
This a Google G1.
You know, it's the latest thing that's come out.
It runs the Android operating system.
I think I heard somebody talk about that before.
It's odd. It has a battery.
It also has coiled electronics
that WiTricity has put into the back of it.
And if I can get the camera --
okay, great --
you'll see, as I get sort of close...
you're looking at a cellphone powered completely wirelessly.
(Applause)
So, you know they don't make it easy at Apple to get inside their phones.
So we put a little sleeve on the back,
but we should be able to get this guy to wake up too.
And those of you that have an iPhone recognize the green center.
(Applause)
You'll see that what we did there is put a little thing in the back, to do that,
and it probably beeps, actually, as it goes on as well.
But they typically use it to light up the screen.
So, imagine these things could go ... they could go in your ceiling.
They could go in the floor. They could go, actually, underneath your desktop.
So that when you walk in or you come in from home,
if you carry a purse, it works in your purse.
You never have to worry about plugging these things in again.
And think of what that would do for you.
sort of in the immortal visions of The New Yorker magazine,
I thought I'd put up one more slide.
And for those of you who can't read it, it says,
"It does appear to be some kind of wireless technology."
So, thank you very much.
(Applause)
Something that, in many ways, I wish no one would ever know,
but here I feel kind of obliged to reveal.
in a moment of youthful indiscretion,
I went to law school.
I never practiced law a day in my life;
I pretty much wasn't allowed to.
I want to try to dust off some of those legal skills --
what's left of those legal skills.
I want to make a case.
dare I say lawyerly case,
It's created in 1945
by a psychologist named Karl Duncker.
He created this experiment
that is used in many other experiments in behavioral science.
And here's how it works. Suppose I'm the experimenter.
Doesn't work.
most people figure out the solution,
which you can see here.
done by a scientist named Sam Glucksberg,
"I'm going to time you to establish norms,
If you're the fastest of everyone we're testing here today,
you get 20 dollars."
Now this is several years ago, adjusted for inflation,
it's a decent sum of money for a few minutes of work.
It's a nice motivator.
Bonuses, commissions, their own reality show.
But that's not happening here.
You've got an incentive designed
to sharpen thinking and accelerate creativity,
and it does just the opposite.
It dulls thinking and blocks creativity.
if you do this, then you get that --
work in some circumstances.
and also one of the most ignored.
looking at the science of human motivation,
particularly the dynamics of extrinsic motivators
and intrinsic motivators.
And I'm telling you, it's not even close.
You: we're incentivizing.
Rewards, by their very nature,
narrow our focus, concentrate the mind;
that's why they work in so many cases.
So, for tasks like this,
they work really well.
That reward actually narrows our focus
and restricts our possibility.
in North America, in Australia,
That routine, rule-based, left-brain work --
Low-cost providers can do it cheaper.
No. The rules are mystifying.
The solution, if it exists at all,
is surprising and not obvious.
And for candle problems of any kind,
in any field,
those if-then rewards,
the things around which we've built so many of our businesses,
don't work!
And here's the thing.
Let me marshal the evidence here.
I'm not telling a story, I'm making a case.
They gave these MIT students a bunch of games,
games that involved creativity,
and motor skills, and concentration.
And the offered them, for performance,
three levels of rewards:
small reward, medium reward, large reward.
If you do really well you get the large reward, on down.
bonuses worked as they would be expected:
the higher the pay, the better the performance.
"Let's see if there's any cultural bias here.
Let's go to Madurai, India and test it."
Standard of living is lower.
In Madurai, a reward that is modest in North American standards,
Same deal. A bunch of games, three levels of rewards.
People offered the medium level of rewards
did no better than people offered the small rewards.
But this time, people offered the highest rewards,
In eight of the nine tasks we examined across three experiments,
No, these are economists from MIT,
from Carnegie Mellon, from the University of Chicago.
LSE, London School of Economics,
alma mater of eleven Nobel Laureates in economics.
Training ground for great economic thinkers
like George Soros, and Friedrich Hayek,
economists at LSE looked at 51 studies
of pay-for-performance plans, inside of companies.
and what business does.
And what worries me, as we stand here in the rubble
of the economic collapse,
their policies about talent and people,
and rooted more in folklore than in science.
And if we really want to get out of this economic mess,
if we really want high performance
or threaten them with a sharper stick.
We need a whole new approach.
who've been studying motivation have given us this new approach.
It's built much more around intrinsic motivation.
And to my mind, that new operating system for our businesses
revolves around three elements:
autonomy, mastery and purpose.
Autonomy: the urge to direct our own lives.
Mastery: the desire to get better and better at something that matters.
Purpose: the yearning to do what we do
in the service of something larger than ourselves.
In the 20th century, we came up with this idea of management.
Management did not emanate from nature.
Somebody invented it.
It doesn't mean it's going to work forever.
Management is great.
Traditional notions of management are great
if you want compliance.
But if you want engagement, self-direction works better.
You don't see a lot of it,
It looks like less than half.
And they do something incredibly cool.
Being Australians, everybody has a beer.
has produced a whole array of software fixes
that might never have existed.
done, famously, at Google --
where engineers can spend 20% of their time
working on anything they want.
They have autonomy over their time,
their task, their team, their technique.
Radical amounts of autonomy.
And at Google, as many of you know,
things like Gmail, Orkut, Google News.
created by two American consultants,
They just have to get their work done.
Meetings in these kinds of environments are optional.
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,
if you had gone to an economist, anywhere,
"Hey, I've got these two different models for creating an encyclopedia.
If they went head to head, who would win?"
This is the Ali-Frazier of motivation, right?
This is the Thrilla in Manila.
Intrinsic motivators versus extrinsic motivators.
Autonomy, mastery and purpose,
One: Those 20th century rewards,
those motivators we think are a natural part of business,
do work, but only in a surprisingly narrow band of circumstances.
the drive to do things for their own sake.
The drive to do things cause they matter.
if we get past this lazy, dangerous, ideology
of carrots and sticks,
we can strengthen our businesses,
we can solve a lot of those candle problems,
we can change the world.
I just want to say my name is Emmanuel Jal.
And I come from a long way.
I've been telling a story that has been so painful for me.
It's been a tough journey for me, traveling the world,
telling my story in form of a book.
And also telling it like now.
And also, the easiest one was
when I was doing it in form of a music.
I'm doing this
because of an old lady in my village now,
who have lost her children.
There is no newspaper to cover her pain,
and what she wants to change in this society.
And I'm doing it for a young man
who want to create a change and has no way to project his voice
because he can't write.
Or there is no Internet, like Facebook, MySpace,
YouTube, for them to talk.
this painful stories out, the dreams I have,
sometimes, is like the voices of the dead,
that I have seen
would tell me, "Don't give up. Keep on going."
Because sometime I feel like stopping and not doing it,
because I didn't know what I was putting myself into.
when my country was at war.
I saw my village burned down.
The world that meant a lot to me, I saw it
vanish in my face.
I saw my aunt in rape when I was only five.
My mother was claimed by the war.
My brothers and sisters were scattered.
And up to now, me and my father
were detached and I still have issues with him.
Seeing people die every day,
my mother crying,
it's like I was raised in a violence.
And that made me call myself a war child.
I became a child soldier.
But one thing I knew
was an image that I saw that stuck in my head.
When I went to the training camp I say,
"I want to kill as many Muslims,
and as many Arabs, as possible."
The training wasn't easy, but that was the driving force,
because I wanted to revenge for my family.
I wanted to revenge for my village.
because I came to discover the truth.
What was actually killing us wasn't the Muslims,
wasn't the Arabs.
It was somebody sitting somewhere manipulating the system,
and using religion to get what they want to get out of us,
which is the oil, the diamond,
the gold and the land.
So realizing the truth gave me a position to choose:
should I continue to hate, or let it go?
music with the Muslims. I dance with them.
I even had a movie out called "War Child,"
funded by Muslim people.
So that pain has gone out.
But my story is huge.
So I'm just going to go into a different step now,
which is easier for me.
I'm going to give you poem
called "Forced to Sin,"
which is from my album "War Child."
I talk about my story.
One of the journey that I tread
when I was tempted to eat my friend because we had no food
and we were like around 400.
And only 16 people survived that journey.
So I hope you're going to hear this.
My every moment.
In the burning jungle, and the desert plain.
of my comrade,
stealing chickens, goats and sheeps,
forced to sin to make a living,
that I'm fighting for.
Don't even know the day I'll ever return.
snakes, and anything that had life.
Thank you.
(Applause)
I never saw anybody
to tell my story to them
so they could advise me or do therapy.
So the music had been my therapy for me.
It's been where I actually see heaven,
where I can be happy,
where I can be a child again, in dances, through music.
So one thing I know about music:
music is the only thing that has power
to enter your cell system,
your mind, your heart,
influence your soul and your spirit,
and can even influence the way you live
without even you knowing.
Music is the only thing that can
make you want to wake up your bed
and shake your leg,
without even wanting to do it.
And so the power music has
I normally compare to the power love
when love doesn't see a color.
You know, if you fall in love with a frog, that's it.
is powerful is when
I was still a soldier back then.
I hated the people in the north.
But I don't know why I don't hate their music.
So we party and dance to their music.
And one thing that shocked me is one day
they brought an Arab musician
to come and entertain the soldiers.
And I almost broke my leg dancing to his music.
But I had this question.
So now I'm doing music so I know what the power of music is.
I've been in a painful journey.
Today is day number 233
in which I only eat dinner.
I don't eat breakfast. No lunch.
And I've done a campaign called
Lose to Win.
Where I'm losing so that I could win
the battle that I'm fighting now.
So my breakfast, my lunch,
I donate it to a charity that I founded
because we want to build a school in Sudan.
it's a normal thing in my home, people eat one meal a day.
Here I am in the West. I choose not to.
So in my village now, kids there,
they normally listen to BBC, or any radio,
and they are waiting to know,
the day Emmanuel will eat his breakfast
it means he got the money to build our school.
And so I made a commitment. I say,
"I'm gonna not eat my breakfast."
I thought I was famous enough that I would raise the money within one month,
but I've been humbled.
(Laughter)
And I said, "No stop until we get it."
And like it's been done on Facebook, MySpace.
The people are giving three dollars.
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents.
Somebody donated 20 cents online.
I don't know how they did it.
(Laughter)
But that moved me.
is what I'm willing to die for.
I'm willing to die for this,
because I know what it can do to my people.
Education enlighten your brain,
give you so many chances,
and you're able to survive.
As a nation we have been crippled.
For so many years we have fed on aid.
You see a 20-years-old, 30-years-old
families in a refugee camps.
They only get the food that drops from the sky, from the U.N.
you're killing a whole generation if you just give them aid.
If anybody want to help us
this is what we need.
Give us tools. Give the farmers tools.
It's rain. Africa is fertile. They can grow the crops.
(Applause)
Invest in education.
Education so that we have strong institution
that can create a revolution to change everything.
Because we have all those old men
that are creating wars in Africa. They will die soon.
But if you invest in education
then we'll be able to change Africa.
That's what I'm asking.
(Applause)
I founded a charter called Gua Africa,
where we put kids in school.
And now we have a couple in university.
We have like 40 kids, ex-child soldiers
mixed with anybody that we feel like we want to support.
And I said "I'm going to put it in practice."
And with the people that are going to follow me and help me do things.
That's what I want to do to change,
to make a difference in the world.
so I want to sing a song.
But I'll ask you guys to stand up
so we celebrate the life of a British aid worker
called Emma McCune
that made it possible for me to be here.
I'm gonna sing this song,
just to inspire you how this woman has made a difference.
She came to my country and saw the importance
of education.
is to invest in the women, educating them,
educating the children,
so that they could come and create a revolution
in this complex society.
So she even ended up marrying a commander
from the SPLA.
And she rescued over 150 child soldiers.
One of them happened to be me now.
And so at this moment I want to ask to celebrate Emma with me.
Are you guys ready to celebrate Emma?
♫ Another starving refugee ♫
♫ What would I be? ♫
♫ If Emma never rescued me? ♫
♫ What would I be? ♫
Thank you.
(Applause)
(Applause)
If I could reveal anything
that is hidden from us,
at least in modern cultures,
it would be to reveal something that we've forgotten,
that we used to know
as well as we knew our own names.
And that is that we live in a competent universe,
that we are part of a brilliant planet,
and that we are surrounded by genius.
that tries to learn from those geniuses,
That's where I live,
and it's my university as well.
I'm surrounded by genius. I cannot help but
remember the organisms and the ecosystems
Remember this.
This is what happens every year.
This is what keeps its promise.
While we're doing bailouts, this is what happened.
Imagine that orchestration.
You think TED is hard to organize. (Laughter) Right?
Imagine, and if you haven't done this in a while, do.
Imagine the timing, the coordination,
all without top-down laws,
or policies, or climate change protocols.
This happens every year.
There is lots of showing off.
There is lots of love in the air.
There's lots of grand openings.
And the organisms, I promise you,
have all of their priorities in order.
because he's living, usually on his back,
looking up at those grasses.
And one time he came up to me --
he was about seven or eight years old -- he came up to me.
And there was a wasp's nest
that I had let grow in my yard,
right outside my door.
And most people knock them down when they're small.
But it was fascinating to me,
because I was looking at this sort of fine Italian end papers.
And he came up to me and he knocked.
He would come every day with something to show me.
And like, knock like a woodpecker on my door until I opened it up.
And he asked me
how I had made the house for those wasps,
because he had never seen one this big.
And I told him, "You know, Cody,
the wasps actually made that."
And we looked at it together.
And I could see why he thought,
you know -- it was so beautifully done.
It was so architectural. It was so precise.
had he already believed the myth
that if something was that well done,
that we must have done it.
How did he not know --
that we're not the first ones to build.
We're not the first ones to process cellulose.
or to waterproof, or to try to heat and cool a structure.
that organisms, other organisms,
the rest of the natural world,
And they're focusing on function.
What I'd like to do is show you a few of the things
that they're learning.
They have asked themselves,
"What if, every time I started to invent something,
I asked, 'How would nature solve this?'"
This is an amazing picture from a Czech photographer named Jack Hedley.
This is a story about an engineer at J.R. West.
They're the people who make the bullet train.
It was called the bullet train
because it was rounded in front,
but every time it went into a tunnel
it would build up a pressure wave,
and then it would create like a sonic boom when it exited.
So the engineer's boss said,
"Find a way to quiet this train."
He went to the equivalent of an Audubon Society meeting.
And he studied -- there was a film about king fishers.
without a splash. Look at this picture.
Without a splash, so they can see the fish.
And he thought, "What if we do this?"
Quieted the train.
Made it go 10 percent faster on 15 percent less electricity.
We're not the first ones to have to protect ourselves
from some bacteria.
Turns out that -- this is a Galapagos Shark.
It has no bacteria on its surface, no fouling on its surface, no barnacles.
And it's not because it goes fast.
It actually basks. It's a slow-moving shark.
So how does it keep its body free of bacteria build-up?
It doesn't do it with a chemical.
It does it, it turns out, with the same denticles
that you had on Speedo bathing suits,
that broke all those records in the Olympics,
And that pattern, the architecture of that pattern
on its skin denticles
keep bacteria from being able to land and adhere.
There is a company called Sharklet Technologies
that's now putting this on the surfaces in hospitals
to keep bacteria from landing,
which is better than dousing it with anti-bacterials or harsh cleansers
that many, many organisms are now becoming drug resistant.
Hospital-acquired infections are now killing
more people every year in the United States
than die from AIDS or cancer or car accidents combined --
about 100,000.
It has no fresh water that it's able to drink,
but it drinks water out of fog.
It's got bumps on the back of its wing covers.
And those bumps act like a magnet for water.
They have water-loving tips, and waxy sides.
And the fog comes in and it builds up on the tips.
And it goes down the sides and goes into the critter's mouth.
There is actually a scientist here at Oxford
who studied this, Andrew Parker.
so that they gather water from the fog.
Organisms don't think of CO2 as a poison.
Plants and organisms that make shells,
coral, think of it as a building block.
There is now a cement manufacturing company
starting in the United States called Calera.
They've borrowed the recipe from the coral reef,
and they're using CO2 as a building block
in cement, in concrete.
Instead of -- cement usually
emits a ton of CO2 for every ton of cement.
Now it's reversing that equation,
and actually sequestering half a ton of CO2
thanks to the recipe from the coral.
How does nature gather the sun's energy?
This is a new kind of solar cell
that's based on how a leaf works.
It's self-assembling.
It can be put down on any substrate whatsoever.
It's extremely inexpensive
and rechargeable every five years.
It's actually a company a company that I'm involved in called OneSun,
with Paul Hawken.
that takes salt out of water.
We take water and push it against a membrane.
And then we wonder why the membrane clogs
and why it takes so much electricity.
Nature does something much more elegant.
And it's in every cell.
Every red blood cell of your body right now
has these hourglass-shaped pores
called aquaporins.
They actually export water molecules through.
It's kind of a forward osmosis.
They export water molecules through,
and leave solutes on the other side.
along lines of stress.
This algorithm has been put into a software program
that's now being used to make bridges lightweight,
to make building beams lightweight.
Actually G.M. Opel used it
to create that skeleton you see,
in what's called their bionic car.
It lightweighted that skeleton using a minimum amount of material,
as an organism must,
for the maximum amount of strength.
this beetle uses one material, chitin.
And it finds many many ways
to put many functions into it.
It's waterproof.
It's strong and resilient.
It's breathable. It creates color through structure.
Whereas that chip bag has about seven layers to do all of those things.
One of our major inventions
that we need to be able to do
to come even close to what these organisms can do
is to find a way
to minimize the amount of material, the kind of material we use,
and to add design to it.
We use five polymers in the natural world
to do everything that you see.
In our world we use about 350 polymers
Nanotechnology, nanoparticles, you hear a lot of worry about this.
Loose nanoparticles. What is really interesting to me
is that not many people have been asking,
"How can we consult nature about how to make nanotechnology safe?"
Nature has been doing that for a long time.
Embedding nanoparticles in a material for instance, always.
In fact, sulfur-reducing bacteria,
as part of their synthesis,
they will emit, as a byproduct,
nanoparticles into the water.
But then right after that, they emit a protein
that actually gathers and aggregates those nanoparticles
because they have to work or barter for every single bit that they get.
And one of the largest fields right now,
in the world of energy grids,
you hear about the smart grid.
One of the largest consultants are the social insects.
Swarm technology. There is a company called Regen.
They are looking at how ants and bees
find their food and their flowers
in the most effective way
as a whole hive.
And they're having appliances in your home
talk to one another through that algorithm,
and determine how to minimize peak power use.
that are making what they call a synthetic tree,
because they are saying, "There is no pump at the bottom of a tree."
It's capillary action and transpiration pulls
water up, a drop at a time,
pulling it, releasing it from a leaf and pulling it up through the roots.
create 600 volts of electricity
with the chemicals that are in your body.
Even more interesting to me is that
600 volts doesn't fry it.
You know we use PVC, and we sheath wires
with PVC for insulation.
These organisms, how are they insulating
against their own electric charge?
These are some questions that we've yet to ask.
Humpback whale has scalloped edges on its flippers.
And those scalloped edges
play with flow in such a way
that is reduces drag by 32 percent.
These wind turbines can rotate in incredibly slow windspeeds, as a result.
that uses far less power than our chips.
And it's based on the cochlear of your ear,
able to pick up internet, wireless, television signals
and radio signals, in the same chip.
Finally, on an ecosystem scale.
in their planning department.
And what we're saying is that,
shouldn't our cities do at least as well,
in terms of ecosystem services,
as the native systems that they replace?
So we're creating something called Ecological Performance Standards
The question I would ask is, "What's worth solving?"
If you haven't seen this, it's pretty amazing.
Dr. Adam Neiman.
This is a depiction of
all of the water on Earth
in relation to the volume of the Earth --
all the ice, all the fresh water, all the sea water --
and all the atmosphere that we can breathe, in relation to the volume of the Earth.
And inside those balls
life, over 3.8 billion years,
has made a lush, livable place for us.
of organisms
to come to this planet and ask ourselves,
"How can we live here gracefully over the long haul?"
How can we do what life has learned to do?
Which is to create conditions conducive to life.
Now in order to do this, the design challenge
of our century, I think,
we need a way to remind ourselves of those geniuses,
and to somehow meet them again.
I've been honored to work on
is a new website. And I would encourage you all to please go to it.
It's called AskNature.org.
And what we're trying to do, in a TEDesque way,
And he's gathering all biological information
on one website.
And the scientists who are contributing to EOL are answering a question,
"What can we learn from this organism?"
And that information will go into AskNature.org.
And hopefully, any inventor, anywhere in the world,
will be able, in the moment of creation,
to type in, "How does nature remove salt from water?"
And up will come mangroves, and sea turtles
and your own kidneys.
be able to
do as Cody does,
and actually be in touch
with these incredible models,
these elders that have been here
far, far longer than we have.
And hopefully, with their help,
we'll learn how to live on this Earth,
and on this home that is ours, but not ours alone.
Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Take a look at this picture.
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.
These African students are doing their homework
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city
because they don't have any electricity at home.
Now, I haven't met these particular students,
but I've met students like them.
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.
So here is the puzzle.
Why is it that Nelson has access
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology
for generating electric light in the home?
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available
when people can bring new technologies in
and make them available to someone like Nelson.
What kinds of rules?
The electric company in this nation
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell
electricity at a very low, subsidized price --
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,
to hook up many other users.
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,
rules where businesses earn a small profit,
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.
The president has seen how those rules worked well.
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,
but ran into a firestorm of protest
from businesses and consumers
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him
from letting the win-win solution help his country.
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.
how we can change rules.
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight
that we can make practical,
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,
and more choices to leaders --
who, in many countries, are also people.
(Laughter)
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,
a choice like giving the president the choice
to raise prices on electricity,
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming
subsidized electric power.
So if you give just to one side or the other,
you'll have tension or friction.
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,
that will give us a set of rules
for changing rules that get us out of traps.
And he says that if you want to see
the damaging effects of rules,
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.
In particular check out Asia.
If you zoom in here,
you can see North Korea, in outline here,
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.
Now, you won't be surprised to learn
that the rules in North Korea
keep people there in the dark.
that North Korea and South Korea
started out with identical sets of rules
in both the sense of laws and regulations,
but also in the deeper senses of understandings,
norms, culture, values and beliefs.
When they separated, they made choices
that led to very divergent paths
for their sets of rules.
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules
that we use to interact with each other,
Zoom in on Haiti,
in outline here.
Haiti is also dark,
compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,
which has about the same number of residents.
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,
which has half as many residents
as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.
What Haiti warns us is that
rules can be bad because governments are weak.
It's not just that the rules are bad because
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,
we can't just tear down.
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.
both the potential and the challenges
of working with rules.
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,
China was the world's high-technology leader.
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.
And they soon adopted rules which
slowed down innovation
and cut China off from the rest of the world.
So as other countries in the world innovated,
in the sense both of developing
newer technologies,
but also developing newer rules,
the Chinese were cut off from those advances.
Income there stayed stagnant,
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.
It plots income, average income in China
as a percentage of average income in the United States.
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.
But then in the late '70s something changed.
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up
very quickly with the United States.
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.
The brightest spot in China,
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,
is Hong Kong.
Hong Kong was a small bit of China
that, for most of the 20th century,
operated under a very different set of rules
than the rest of mainland China --
rules that were copied
from working market economies of the time,
and administered by the British.
millions of people could go, from the mainland,
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.
But, to get on a process of increasing income,
increasing skills
led to very rapid growth there.
Hong Kong was also the model
which leaders like Deng Xiaoping
could copy, when they decided to move
all of the mainland towards the market model.
the importance of offering choices to his people.
So instead of forcing everyone in China
to shift immediately to the market model,
they proceeded by creating some special zones
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:
zones where Chinese could come and work,
and cities grew up very rapidly there;
also zones where foreign firms could come in
and make things.
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm
that made the iPhone that many of you have,
and they made it with labor from Chinese
who moved there to Shenzhen.
So after the four special zones,
there were 14 coastal cites
that were open in the same sense,
and eventually demonstrated successes
in these places that people could opt in to,
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.
One is: preserve choices for people.
Two: operate on the right scale.
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,
but a village would be too small
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people
all working under good rules.
On the other hand, the nation is too big.
If you try to change the rules in the nation,
you can't give some people a chance
to hold back, see how things turn out,
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.
But cities give you this opportunity
to create new places,
with new rules that people can opt in to.
And they're large enough
to get all of the benefits that we can have
when millions of us work together under good rules.
conceive of something called a charter city.
We start with a charter that specifies
all the rules required
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.
We'll need to attract the investors
who will build out the infrastructure --
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.
You'll need to attract firms,
who will come hire the people who move there first.
And you'll need to attract families,
the residents who will come and live there permanently,
raise their children, get an education for their children,
and get their first job.
The city can be built.
And we can scale this model.
We can go do it over and over again.
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.
Those are captured in the charter.
We also need the choices for people.
That's really built into the model
if we allow for the possibility of building cities
on uninhabited land.
You start from uninhabited territory.
People can come live under the new charter,
but no one is forced to live under it.
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:
cases where nations work together,
in effect, de facto,
the way China and Britain worked together
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,
and then scale it throughout China.
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,
through its actions in Hong Kong,
did more to reduce world poverty
than all the aid programs that we've undertaken
in the last century.
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships
to replicate this again,
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.
a delegation of control from one country to another
to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.
Now, when I say that,
some of you are starting to think,
"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions
that come up when we start to think about these things,
can get in the way, can make us pull back,
can shut down our ability,
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.
The thing that was bad about colonialism,
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,
is that it involved elements of
coercion and condescension.
This model is all about choices,
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.
It must have occurred to Castro
that he has the chance to do for Cuba
what Deng Xiaoping did for China,
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south
that has a very special status.
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,
where a treaty gives the United States
administrative responsibility
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.
They want to get out.
Why don't you, Canada, take over?
Build -- run a special administrative zone.
Allow a new city to be built up there.
Allow many people to come in.
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.
Others will hold back. But this will be
the gateway that will connect
the modern economy and the modern world
to my country."
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone
that people can opt into as a rule.
It's a rule for changing rules.
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.
They also totally get the idea that in some instances
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --
the kind of investors who will come build the port,
build the roads, in a new city --
if they do it along with a partner nation.
Perhaps even in some arrangement
that's a little bit like an escrow account,
where you put land in the escrow account
and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.
There is also lots of land in Africa
where new cities could be built.
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.
There are immense stretches of land like this --
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.
Now, if we generalize this and think about
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --
cities that will help create places for the
many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people
who will move to cities in the coming century --
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks
like most of the world is already built out.
So let me show you why that's wrong.
Take this representation of all of the land.
Turn it into a square that stands for
all the arable land on Earth.
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up
by the cities that three billion people now live in.
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.
they would be dots like this.
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth
by building more cities that people can move to.
And if these are cities governed by good rules,
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,
safe from disease and bad sanitation,
where people have a chance to get a job.
They can get basic utilities like electricity.
Their kids can get an education.
building the first charter cities,
scaling this so we build many more?
It would help to have a manual.
(Laughter)
What university professors could do
is write some details that might go into this manual.
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,
go out and design them.
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)
suppose it isn't just Canada
that does the deal with Raul Castro.
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.
How would we write the treaty to do that?
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong
are cities that made huge gains
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.
You could use the gains on the value of the land
to pay for things like the police, the courts,
but the school system and the health care system too,
which make this a more attractive place to live,
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --
which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone
and build it, and set up the basic rules,
go very much in the right direction.
How could we have buildings that are
low cost and affordable for people who work
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,
but make those buildings energy efficient,
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down
in an earthquake or a hurricane.
Many technical details to be worked out,
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things
can already tell that there is no roadblock,
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,
that will keep us from delivering on
a truly global win-win solution.
The reason we can be so well off,
even though there is so many people on earth,
is because of the power of ideas.
We can share ideas with other people,
and when they discover them, they share with us.
It's not like scarce objects,
where sharing means we each get less.
When we share ideas we all get more.
When we think about ideas in that way,
we usually think about technologies.
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;
rules like, let's have a tax system
that supports a research university
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land
that is registered in a government office,
that people can pledge as collateral.
and particularly innovate in the sense
of coming up with rules for changing rules,
so we don't get stuck with bad rules,
then we can keep moving progress forward
and truly make the world a better place,
so that people like Nelson and his friends
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.
(Applause)
Good morning everybody.
I'd like to talk about a couple of things today.
The first thing is water.
Now I see you've all been enjoying the water
that's been provided for you here at the conference,
over the past couple of days.
And I'm sure you'll feel that it's from a safe source.
What if it was from a source like this?
Then statistics would actually say
that half of you would now be suffering
with diarrhea.
I talked a lot in the past about statistics,
and the provision of safe drinking water for all.
But they just don't seem to get through.
And I think I've worked out why.
It's because, using current thinking,
the scale of the problem
just seems too huge to contemplate solving.
So we just switch off:
us, governments and aid agencies.
Well, today, I'd like to show you
that through thinking differently,
the problem has been solved.
By the way, since I've been speaking,
another 13,000 people around the world
are suffering now with diarrhea.
And four children have just died.
because I got angry.
I, like most of you, was sitting down, the day after Christmas in 2004,
when I was watching the devastating news
of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in,
playing out on TV.
The days and weeks that followed,
people fleeing to the hills,
being forced to drink contaminated water
or face death.
That really stuck with me.
Then, a few months later,
Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America.
"Okay," I thought, "here's a First World country, let's see what they can do."
Day one: nothing.
Day two: nothing.
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome?
People were shooting each other on the streets
for TV sets and water.
That's when I decided I had to do something.
and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife. (Laughter)
However, after a few failed prototypes,
I finally came up with this, the Lifesaver bottle.
Before Lifesaver, the best hand filters were only capable
of filtering down to about 200 nanometers.
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers.
So a 200-nanometer bacteria
is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole.
The smallest virus, on the other hand,
is about 25 nanometers.
So that's definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes.
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers.
So nothing is getting through.
Would you like to see that?
I spent all the time setting this up, so I guess I should.
We're in the fine city of Oxford.
So -- someone's done that up.
Fine city of Oxford, so what I've done is I've gone
and got some water from the River Cherwell,
and the River Thames,
that flow through here. And this is the water.
But I got to thinking, you know,
if we were in the middle of a flood zone
in Bangladesh, the water wouldn't look like this.
So I've gone and got some stuff to add into it.
And this is from my pond.
We're just going to pour that in there.
from a sewage plant farm.
So I'm just going to put that in there.
(Laughter)
Put that in there. There we go.
(Laughter)
And some other bits and pieces, chuck that in there.
And I've got a gift here from a friend of mine's rabbit.
So we're just going to put that in there as well.
(Laughter)
Okay. (Laughter) Now.
You just scoop the water up.
Today I'm going to use a jug
just to show you all. Let's get a bit of that poo in there.
That's not dirty enough. Let's just stir that up a little bit.
Okay, so I'm going to take this really filthy water,
and put it in here. Do you want a drink yet?
(Laughter)
Okay. There we go.
Replace the top.
Give it a few pumps. Okay?
That's all that's necessary.
Now as soon as I pop the teat,
sterile drinking water is going to come out.
I've got to be quick. Okay, ready?
There we go. Mind the electrics.
That is safe, sterile drinking water.
(Applause)
Cheers.
(Applause)
There you go Chris.
(Applause)
What's it taste of?
Let's see Chris's program throughout the rest of the show. Okay?
(Laughter)
It'll last for 6,000 liters.
And when it's expired, using failsafe technology,
the system will shut off, protecting the user.
Pop the cartridge out. Pop a new one in.
It's good for another 6,000 liters.
Traditionally, in a crisis, what do we do?
We ship water.
Then, after a few weeks, we set up camps.
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water.
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp?
Diseases spread. More resources are required.
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating.
But by thinking differently,
and shipping these,
people can stay put.
They can make their own sterile drinking water,
and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives.
for this to work.
Using the old thinking, of national infrastructure
and pipe work, is too expensive.
When you run the numbers on a calculator,
you run out of noughts.
So here is the "thinking different" bit.
and using man-made processes to do it,
let's use Mother Nature. She's got a fantastic system.
She picks the water up from there,
desalinates it, for free, transports it over there,
and dumps it onto the mountains, rivers, and streams.
And where do people live? Near water.
All we've go to do
is make it sterile. How do we do that?
Or we could use one of these.
The same technology, in a jerry can.
This will process 25,000 liters of water;
that's good enough for a family of four,
for three years.
And how much does it cost?
About half a cent a day to run.
Thank you.
at the point of use,
mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day
to collect their water.
They can get it from a source nearby.
So with just eight billion dollars,
we can hit the millennium goal's target
of halving the number of people
without access to safe drinking water.
To put that into context,
The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds
a year on foreign aid.
But why stop there?
With 20 billion dollars, everyone can have access to safe drinking water.
So the three-and-a-half billion people
that suffer every year as a result,
and the two million kids that die every year,
will live.
Thank you.
Well, this is 2009.
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists
are anxious to celebrate this.
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us
on almost every aspect
of Darwin and his life,
and how he changed our thinking.
I say almost every aspect,
because there is one aspect of this story
which they have thrown no light on.
So I'm going to talk about it.
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,
there's a chimp, there's a man;
they're astoundingly different,
no resemblance at all.
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff
about culture or psychology, or behavior.
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,
measurable physical differences.
is hairy and walking on four legs.
That one is a naked biped. Why?
I mean --
(Laughter)
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe
there's a reason for that.
If we changed so much, something must have happened.
What happened?
Everybody knew the answer.
They knew what happened.
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,
or to chase after animals,
or to free our hands for weapons.
And we got so overheated in the chase
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.
Everybody knew that, for generations.
at the accompanying microfauna
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.
And they weren't savanna species.
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze
fossilized pollen.
Some of it even came from lianas,
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.
we know that our earliest ancestors
were moving around on four legs in the trees,
before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.
This is not something I've made up.
and spoke to University College London.
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,
forget about it. It was wrong.
We've got to go back to square one and start again."
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.
You've got this beautiful paradigm.
You've believed it through generations.
Nobody has questioned it.
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.
And now it's whipped away from under you.
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?
Thomas S. Kuhn
wrote a seminal treatise
about this back in 1962.
He said what scientists do
when a paradigm fails
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.
(Laughter)
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.
So they say, "Yes it's wrong,
but supposing it was right ..."
(Laughter)
And the only other option open to them
is to stop asking the questions.
So that is what they have done now.
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.
It's what we ought to be doing.
Aaron Filler from Harvard said,
"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.
And we just record what we see."
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!
He knew all about that kind of science.
And he called it hypothesis-free science.
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.
And if you're going to say,
"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,
There was one waiting in the wings.
said, "I think what happened,
perhaps our ancestors
had a more aquatic existence
for some of the time."
He kept it to himself for 30 years.
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.
You've exposed us to public ridicule!
You must never do that again."
And at that time, it became set in stone:
the aquatic theory should be dumped
with the UFOs and the yetis,
as part of the lunatic fringe of science.
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.
I'd like to talk about just a handful
of what have been called the
hallmarks of mankind,
the things that made us different from everybody else,
and all our relatives.
Let's look at our naked skin.
It's obvious that most of the things we think about
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,
are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,
the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,
I mean, look at the elephant.
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms
have aquatic ancestors.
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys
are capable of walking on two legs,
if they want to, for a short time.
There is only one circumstance in which they
always, all of them, walk on two legs,
and that is when they are wading through water.
Do you think that's significant?
David Attenborough thinks it's significant,
as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.
Why should it be there?
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,
has started to migrate to the outside,
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.
In the whale it's complete:
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.
We have got skin lined with this layer.
It's the only possible explanation of why humans,
if they're very unlucky,
can become grossly obese,
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.
We can speak.
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath
are the diving animals and the diving birds.
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.
Trying to imagine a diver
diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.
Try to imagine a gorilla
performing the same maneuver,
and you can see that, compared with gorilla,
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,
they are not staving off the aquatic theory
to protect a theory of their own,
which they've all agreed on, and they love.
There is nothing there.
They are staving off the aquatic theory
to protect a vacuum.
(Laughter)
(Applause)
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times
when Hardy put forward his article."
I don't believe it.
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence
of any incident of that kind,
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.
It's never been done.
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.
They say "Well ...
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.
(Applause)
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."
Some of them have come over.
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.
Anybody else out there? Come on in.
The water is lovely.
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."
That would be very sad.
The second thing that could happen
is that some young genius will arrive,
and say, "I've found it.
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"
No sign of that happening either.
I don't think there is a third option.
a very beautiful thing.
If you look back at the early years of the last century,
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling
between the believers in Mendel,
and the believers in Darwin.
It ended with a new synthesis:
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas
blending together.
And I think the same thing will happen here.
You'll get a new synthesis.
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas
will be blended together.
That would be a beautiful thing.
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.
(Laughter)
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,
"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."
what's holding it up?
I can tell you that in three words.
Academia says no.
They decided in 1960,
"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."
And it's not easy to change their minds.
The professional journals
won't touch it with a barge pole.
The textbooks don't mention it.
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,
let alone look for a reason to it.
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,
won't touch it with a barge pole.
So we never hear the case put for it,
except in jocular references
to people on the lunatic fringe.
Somebody up there
is issuing the commandment,
"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.
because it will get in your way."
of the scientific establishment
are morphing into a kind of priesthood.
But you know, that makes me feel good,
because Richard Dawkins has told us
how to treat a priesthood.
(Laughter)
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it
all the excessive awe and reverence
it's been trained to receive."
Right. I'll go ahead with that.
I'll go along with that too.
Thank you very much.
punched through to the physical.
So this is, as Joy Mountford once said,
kinds of interactive experiences.
resemble mirrors in some way.
Because this is, in some sense, the first way,
this is a project from last year,
when they're just going about their everyday business.
that people then can appreciate and become creative with.
And I came across this fantastic research by Wolfgang Köhler,
the so-called father of gestalt psychology, from 1927,
And he said one of them is called Maluma.
As he says here, most people answer without any hesitation.
which is a kind of synesthesia that all of you have.
like hardness, sharpness, brightness and darkness,
and the phonemes that we're able to speak with.
and P, T and K are perhaps more associated with shapes like this.
And this is an interactive installation which presents
And as you do, you see the shadows of your own speech.
And they sort of fly away, out of your head.
If a computer speech recognition system
is able to recognize what you're saying, then it spells it out.
And if it isn't then it produces a shape which is very phonaesthetically

that people could be staring at,
So that's this kind of recursive observation system.
And I'm going to show a video of the older version of it,
which is just a minute long. Okay.

I'd like to show you thing called Snout, which is --
The idea behind this project is to
make a robot that appears as if it's continually surprised to see you.
It's always kind of doing a double take: "What?"
"What? Is it my shoes?"

I'm mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem;
you may think I'm wrong in this,
comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality.
to stay calm, to be free of career anxiety.
Why we might be victims of these career crises,
as we're weeping softly into our pillows.
One of the reasons why we might be suffering
particularly to anybody who's come to Oxford from abroad.
There's a real problem with snobbery,
because sometimes people from outside the U.K.
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon,
The bad news is that's not true.
What is a snob?
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you,
and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are.
That is snobbery.
According to how you answer that question,
people are either incredibly delighted to see you,
but, as it were, the ideal mother,
somebody who doesn't care about your achievements.
Unfortunately, most people are not our mothers.
Most people make a strict correlation between how much time,
not romantic love, though that may be something --
and indeed start caring so much about material goods.
You know, we're often told that we live in very materialistic times,
that we're all greedy people.
I don't think we are particularly materialistic.
It's not the material goods we want; it's the rewards we want.
It's a new way of looking at luxury goods.
Never before have expectations been so high
about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan.
We're told, from many sources, that anyone can achieve anything.
We've done away with the caste system,
And it's a beautiful idea.
and that problem is envy.
but if there's one dominant emotion in modern society, that is envy.
I think it would be very unusual for anyone here, or anyone watching,
to be envious of the Queen of England.
the reason why we don't envy her is because she's too weird.
We can't relate to her, she speaks in a funny way,
she comes from an odd place.
in the process of identification -- the more there's a danger of envy,
So there's a spirit of equality combined with deep inequality,
which can make for a very stressful situation.
become as rich and famous as Bill Gates,
as it was unlikely in the 17th century
that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy.
But the point is, it doesn't feel that way.
It's made to feel, by magazines and other media outlets,
or impolitely call, "feeling very bad about yourself."
between a society that tells people that they can do anything,
and the existence of low self-esteem.
There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious --
about our careers, about our status in the world today, than ever before.
And it's, again, linked to something nice.
And that nice thing is called meritocracy.
agree that meritocracy is a great thing,
where those who merit to get to the top, get to the top,
you'll also, by implication, and in a far more nasty way,
In other words, your position in life comes to seem not accidental,
but merited and deserved.
And that makes failure seem much more crushing.
when you met a very poor person,
that person would be described as an "unfortunate" --
literally, somebody who had not been blessed by fortune, an unfortunate.
Nowadays, particularly in the United States,
if you meet someone at the bottom of society,
they may unkindly be described as a "loser."
There's a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser,
and that shows 400 years of evolution in society
and our belief in who is responsible for our lives.
It's no longer the gods, it's us. We're in the driving seat.
and very crushing if you're not.
There are more suicides in developed, individualistic countries
than in any other part of the world.
they own their success, but they also own their failure.
that I've been outlining?
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to,
I think it's a crazy idea, completely crazy.
I will support any politician of Left and Right,
with any halfway-decent meritocratic idea;
I am a meritocrat in that sense.
But I think it's insane to believe
the good at the top, bad at the bottom,
exactly done as it should be, is impossible.
There are simply too many random factors:
accidents, accidents of birth,
accidents of things dropping on people's heads, illnesses, etc.
We will never get to grade them,
never get to grade people as they should.
he's going to do that on the Day of Judgment,
You don't necessarily know what someone's true value is.
That is an unknown part of them,
and we shouldn't behave as though it is known.
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this.
When we think about failing in life, when we think about failure,
one of the reasons why we fear failing
is not just a loss of income, a loss of status.
If you open the newspaper any day of the week,
it's full of people who've messed up their lives.
They've slept with the wrong person, taken the wrong substance,
passed the wrong piece of legislation --
whatever it is, and then are fit for ridicule.
In other words, they have failed. And they are described as "losers."
Now, is there any alternative to this?
in the fifth century B.C., was essentially an art form
and also according them a level of sympathy,
which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them.

if you're not familiar with it already.

I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary.
Again, a book they were enchanted to discover.
And they wrote "Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud."
my favorite is Sophocles' Oedipus the King:
"Sex With Mum Was Blinding."
you've got the tabloid newspaper.
At the other end of the spectrum, you've got tragedy and tragic art.
He is not a loser, though he has lost.
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us,
and why it's so very, very important, I think.
is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human.
That's a very new situation.
Most other societies have had, right at their center,
the universe, whatever it is -- something else that is being worshiped.
We've slightly lost the habit of doing that,
It's an escape from our own competition,
and our own dramas.
and that is so deeply important to us.
And one of the interesting things about success
is that we think we know what it means.
always thinking, how can I be more successful?
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance.
where the element of loss is.
And I think any wise life will accept,
our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own.
They're sucked in from other people;
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years.
to advertising, to marketing, etc.
These are hugely powerful forces
that define what we want and how we view ourselves.
When we're told that banking is a very respectable profession,
a lot of us want to go into banking.
When banking is no longer so respectable, we lose interest in banking.
We are highly open to suggestion.
on our ideas of success,
but we should make sure that they are our own.
We should focus in on our ideas,
and make sure that we own them;
that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions.
that it isn't, in fact, what you wanted all along.
Let's make sure our ideas of success are truly our own.
But how do you reconcile this idea
of it being bad to think of someone as a "loser,"
of the winning and losing process that I want to stress,
and politicians always talk about justice.
Now I'm a firm believer in justice, I just think that it's impossible.
That's what I'm trying to leave room for;
otherwise, it can get quite claustrophobic.
Or do you think that you can't,
is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them,
and that somehow the crueler the environment,

This is Birhan, who was the Ethiopian girl

This is Tiananmen Square.

This is Neda, the Iranian girl
who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran
only a few weeks ago, and she is now the focus, rightly so,

What they have in common is what we see unlocks
what we cannot see.
What we see unlocks the invisible ties
and bonds of sympathy that bring us together
to become a human community.
What these pictures demonstrate is that
we do feel the pain of others,
however distantly.
What I think these pictures demonstrate
is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves.
What these pictures demonstrate is
that there is a moral sense across all religions, across all faiths,
across all continents -- a moral sense that
not only do we share the pain of others,
and believe in something bigger than ourselves
but we have a duty to act when we see things
that are wrong that need righted,
see injuries that need to be corrected,
see problems that need to be rectified.
going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s.
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said --
and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister --
"Isn’t this man a communist?"
The reply was, "No, Mr President, he’s an anti-communist."
And Ronald Reagan said, "I don’t care what kind of communist he is!"
(Laughter)
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme,
the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden,
"Well, what do you believe in? Do you want to abolish the rich?"
He said, "No, I want to abolish the poor."
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance
to realize their potential to the full.
that commands attention from people of every religion
and every faith, and people of no faith.
But I think what's new is that we now have the capacity
to communicate instantaneously across frontiers
right across the world.
We now have the capacity to find common ground
with people who we will never meet,
but who we will meet through the Internet and through
all the modern means of communication;
that we now have the capacity to organize
and take collective action together
to deal with the problem or an injustice
that we want to deal with;
and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history,
and it is the start of what I would call
the creation of a truly global society.
under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters.
They protested across Britain.
They won public opinion over a long period of time.
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful.
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown

the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago.
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria
as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children
who were part of the defeated families of Austria,
that in Britain she wanted to take action,
but she had to go house to house,
leaflet to leaflet, to get people to attend a rally
in the Royal Albert Hall
that eventually gave birth to Save the Children,
an international organization that is now fully recognized
as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world.
But what more could she have done
if she’d had the modern means of communications available to her
to create a sense that the injustice that people saw
had to be acted upon immediately?
In Philippines in 2001, President Estrada --
a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime,
eventually brought it down and it was, of course, called the "coup de text." (Laughter)
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago.
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs
of what was happening at the polling stations, it was impossible
for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do.
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out,
a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening, until these blogs
told the world that there was a repression,
meaning that lives were being lost
and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi,
who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world,
had to be listened to.
Then take Iran itself, and what people are doing today:
following what happened to Neda,
people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people
who are blogging out of Iran, any by everybody who is blogging,
changing their address to Tehran, Iran,
and making it difficult for the security services.
the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications
and our ability to organize internationally.
to fundamentally change the world.
Foreign policy can never be the same again. It cannot be run by elites;
it’s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging,
who are communicating with each other around the world.
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery.
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours
was how young people, children, had the right to education.
100 years ago in most countries in Europe, the pressure was for the right to vote.
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare.
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism, anti-Semitism, racism, apartheid,
discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality;
all these have come under pressure
because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world.
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday
and for the creation of new resources for his foundation.
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so --
when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage. (Laughter)
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer
and I was explaining to him at the time who she was.
Amy Winehouse said, "Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common.
My husband too has spent a long time in prison."
(Laughter)
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage
and he summarized the challenge for us all.
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain, the mountain
of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid.
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead,
the challenge of poverty, of climate change -- global challenges
that needed global solutions
and needed the creation of a truly global society.
Combine the power of a global ethic
with the power of our ability to communicate
and organize globally, with the challenges that we now face,
most of which are global in their nature.
Climate change cannot be solved in one country,
but has got to be solved by the world working together.
A financial crisis, just as we have seen, could not be solved
by America alone or Europe alone;
it needed the world to work together.
Take the problems of security and terrorism and, equally,
the problem of human rights and development:
they cannot be solved by Africa alone;
they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone.
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together.
is to build for the first time, out of a global ethic
and our global ability to communicate
and organize together, a truly global society,
built on that ethic but with institutions
that can serve that global society and make for a different future.
We have now, and are the first generation with, the power to do this.
Take climate change. Is it not absolutely scandalous
that we have a situation
where we know that there is a climate change problem,
where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources
to the poorest countries to deal with that,
when we want to create a global carbon market,
but there is no global institution
that people have been able to agree upon
to deal with this problem?
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months
is an agreement that there will be
a global environmental institution
that is able to deal
with the problems of persuading the whole of the world
to move along a climate-change agenda.
is that we have got to persuade people around the world
to change their behavior as well,
so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility
across the generations.
Take the financial crisis.
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York
or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America.
If people can find that that sub-prime product
has been transferred across nations
many, many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland
or the rest in Britain,
and people's ordinary savings are affected by it,
then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision.
You need in the long run for stability, for economic growth,
for jobs, as well as for financial stability,
global economic institutions that make sure
that growth to be sustained has to be shared,
and are built on the principle
that the prosperity of this world is indivisible.
that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility,
not the ideas that were the basis
of the last stage of financial development over these recent years.
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries
and the rest of the world, the poorest part of the world.
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future,
and yet, out of people’s desire for a global ethic
and a global society that can be done.
This is a country of six and a half million people,
but it has only 80 doctors; it has 200 nurses;
it has 120 midwives.
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people
with such limited resources.
a girl called Miriam.
She was 11 years old; her parents had both died from AIDS,
her mother and then her father.
She was an AIDS orphan being handed
across different extended families to be cared for.
She herself was suffering from HIV;
she was suffering from tuberculosis.
I met her in a field, she was ragged, she had no shoes.
When you looked in her eyes, any girl at the age of eleven
is looking forward to the future,
but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl’s eyes
and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment,
I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV/AIDS fund
would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations.
the poorest countries
based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves
with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture,
so that Africa is not a net importer of food, but an exporter of food.
the problems of security in so many countries around the world.
Burma is in chains, Zimbabwe is a human tragedy,
in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily
for wars that we could prevent.
In the Rwanda Children's Museum,
there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy
and the Children's Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost
in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died.
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life.
It said "David, age 10."
David: ambition to be a doctor.
Favorite sport: football. What did he enjoy most?
Making people laugh.
How did he die?
Tortured to death.
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death:
"Don't worry. The United Nations are coming."
And we never did.
that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda,
and we never did.
institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid,
but also for reconstruction and security
for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world.
So my argument today is basically this.
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society.
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors.
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary
for these institutions to work,
but we should not lose the chance in this generation,
in this decade in particular, with President Obama in America,
with other people working with us around the world,
to create global institutions for the environment,
and for finance,
and for security and for development,
that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples,
our desire to bind the world together, and
our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist.
people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero, "Great speech."
But it is said that in Ancient Greece
when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences,
people turned to each other and didn’t say "Great speech."
They said, "Let's march."
We should be marching towards a global society.
Thank you.
I'm a neuroscientist, a professor at the University of California.
And over the past 35 years,
I've studied behavior
on the basis of everything from genes
through neurotransmitters, dopamine, things like that,
all the way through circuit analysis.
So that's what I normally do.
But then, for some reason,
I got into something else, just recently.
And it all grew out of one of my colleagues asking me
to analyze a bunch of brains
of psychopathic killers.
And the question is, "How do you end up with a psychopathic killer?"
What I mean by psychopathic killer
are these people, these types of people.
And so some of the brains that I've studied
are people you know about.
When I get the brains I don't know what I'm looking at.
It's blind experiments. They also gave me normal people and everything.
And what came up was a number of pieces of data.
So we look at these sorts of things theoretically,
on the basis of genetics,
and brain damage, and interaction with environment,
and exactly how that machine works.
So we're interested in exactly where in the brain,
and what's the most important part of the brain.
So we've been looking at this:
the interaction of genes,
what's called epigenetic effects,
brain damage, and environment,
and how these are tied together.
And how you end up with a psychopath, and a killer,
depends on exactly when the damage occurs.
It's really a very precisely timed thing.
You get different kinds of psychopaths.
The pattern is that those people, every one of them I looked at,
who was a murderer, and was a serial killer,
had damage to their orbital cortex,
which is right above the eyes, the orbits,
and also the interior part of the temporal lobe.
So there is the pattern that every one of them had,
but they all were a little different too.
They had other sorts of brain damage.
A key thing is that
the major violence genes,
it's called the MAO-A gene.
Some of you have this. And it's sex-linked.
It's on the X chromosome. And so in this way
you can only get it from your mother.
And in fact this is probably why mostly men, boys,
are psychopathic killers,
or are very aggressive.
Because a daughter can get one X from the father,
one X from the mother, it's kind of diluted out.
But for a son, he can only get
the X chromosome from his mother.
And it has to do with too much brain serotonin during development,
which is kind of interesting because serotonin
is supposed to make you calm and relaxed.
But if you have this gene, in utero
your brain is bathed in this,
so your whole brain becomes insensitive to serotonin,
so it doesn't work later on in life.
just this past year.
And it does have some consequences.
Theoretically what this means
is that in order to express this gene,
in a violent way,
very early on, before puberty,
you have to be involved in something that is really traumatic --
not a little stress, not being spanked or something,
but really seeing violence,
or being involved in it, in 3D.
Right? That's how the mirror neuron system works.
and you see a lot of violence
in a certain situation,
this is the recipe for disaster, absolute disaster.
And what I think might happen in these areas of the world,
where we have constant violence,
you end up having generations of kids
that are seeing all this violence.
And if I was a young girl, somewhere in a violent area,
you know, a 14 year old, and I want to find a mate,
I'd find some tough guy, right, to protect me.
Well what the problem is this tends to concentrate these genes.
And now the boys and the girls get them.
So I think after several generations,
and here is the idea, we really have a tinderbox.
But then my mother said to me, "I hear you've been going around talking
about psychopathic killers.
And you're talking as if you come from a normal family."
I said, "What the hell are you talking about?"
She then told me about our own family tree.
Now she blamed this on my father's side, of course.
This was one of these cases, because she has no violence in her background,
but my father did.
One of your cousins is Ezra Cornell, founder of Cornell university.
But the bad news is that your cousin is also Lizzie Borden.
And the first murder
of a mother by a son
was my great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather.
Okay, so that's the first case of matricide.
And that book is very interesting. Because it's about witch trials,
and how people thought back then.
There were seven more men, on my father's side,
starting then, Cornells, that were all murderers.
Okay, now this gives one a little pause.
(Laughter)
Because my father himself,
and my three uncles, in World War II,
were all conscientious objectors, all pussycats.
But every once in a while, like Lizzie Borden, like three times a century,
and we're kind of due.
(Laughter)
people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
But more likely is this.
(Laughter)
And we had to take action. Now our kids found out about it.
And they all seemed to be OK.
But our grandkids are going to be kind of concerned here.
So what we've done is I've started to do PET scans
of everybody in the family.
(Laughter)
We started to do PET scans, EEGs and genetic analysis
to see where the bad news is.
Now the only person -- it turns out
one son and one daughter, siblings,
didn't get along and their patterns are exactly the same.
They have the same brain, and the same EEG.
And now they are close as can be.
But there's gonna be bad news somewhere.
And we don't know where it's going to pop up.
So that's my talk.
(Laughter)
Interestingly, Charles Darwin
was born a very lightly pigmented man,
in a moderately-to-darkly pigmented world.
Over the course of his life,
Darwin had great privilege.
He lived in a fairly wealthy home.
He was raised by very supportive and interested parents.
And when he was in his 20s
he saw remarkable things:
tremendous diversity of plants and animals, and humans.
And the observations that he made
on that epic journey
were to be eventually distilled
and to some, the extent, what's a bit infamous
about "The Origin of Species,"
is that there is only one line in it
about human evolution.
"Light will be thrown on the origin of man
and his history."
It wasn't until much longer,
much later,
that Darwin actually spoke
and wrote about humans.
traveling on the Beagle,
and from listening to the accounts
or explorers and naturalists,
he knew that skin color
was one of the most important ways
in which people varied.
And he was somewhat interested in the pattern of skin color.
He knew that darkly pigmented peoples
were found close to the equator;
lightly pigmented peoples, like himself,
were found closer to the poles.
Well he didn't write anything about it in The Origin of Species.
But much later, in 1871,
he did have something to say about it.
And it was quite curious. He said,
"Of all the differences between the races of men,
the color of the skin is the most conspicuous
and one of the best marked."
And he went on to say,
"These differences do not coincide
with corresponding differences in climate."
So he had traveled all around.
He had seen people of different colors
living in different places.
And yet he rejected the idea
that human skin pigmentation
was related to the climate.
If only Darwin had NASA.
Now, one of the wonderful things that NASA does
is it puts up a variety of satellites
that detect all sort of interesting things about our environment.
And for many decades now
there have been a series of TOMS satellites
that have collected data about the radiation of the Earth's surface.
The TOMS 7 satellite data, shown here,
show the annual average
ultraviolet radiation at the Earth's surface.
Now the really hot pink and red areas
are those parts of the world that receive the highest amounts
of UV during the year.
The incrementally cooler colors --
blues, greens, yellows, and finally grays --
indicate areas of much lower ultraviolet radiation.
is just how much of the Northern Hemisphere
is in these cool gray zones.
This has tremendous implications for our understanding
of the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
And what Darwin could not appreciate,
or didn't perhaps want to appreciate at the time,
is that there was a fundamental relationship
between the intensity of ultraviolet radiation
and skin pigmentation.
And that skin pigmentation itself
was a product of evolution.
And so when we look at a map of skin color,
and predicted skin color, as we know it today,
what we see is a beautiful gradient
from the darkest skin pigmentations toward the equator,
and the lightest ones toward the poles.
is that the earliest humans
evolved in high-UV environments,
in equatorial Africa.
The earliest members of our lineage,
the genus Homo, were darkly pigmented.
And we all share this incredible heritage
of having originally been
darkly pigmented,
two million to one and half million years ago.
Let's first look at the relationship
of ultraviolet radiation to the Earth's surface.
In those early days of our evolution,
looking at the equator,
we were bombarded by high levels of ultraviolet radiation.
The UVC, the most energetic type,
was occluded by the Earth's atmosphere.
But UVB and UVA
especially, came in unimpeded.
UVB turns out to be incredibly important.
It's very destructive,
but it also catalyzes the production of vitamin D in the skin,
vitamin D being a molecule that we very much need
for our strong bones, the health of our immune system,
and myriad other important functions in our bodies.
lots and lots of ultraviolet radiation
and the melanin --
this wonderful, complex, ancient polymer
compound in our skin --
served as a superb natural sunscreen.
This polymer is amazing
because it's present in so many different organisms.
and has been recruited over and over again
by evolution, as often happens.
Why change it if it works?
and specifically in our earliest ancestors
evolving in Africa,
against the degradations of ultraviolet radiation,
the destruction, or damage to DNA,
and the breakdown of a very important molecule called folate,
which helps to fuel cell production,
and reproduction in the body.
So, it's wonderful. We evolved this very protective,
wonderful covering of melanin.
And humans dispersed -- not once, but twice.
Major moves, outside of our equatorial homeland,
from Africa into other parts of the Old World,
and most recently, into the New World.
When humans dispersed into these latitudes,
what did they face?
Conditions were significantly colder,
but they were also less intense
with respect to the ultraviolet regime.
look at what's happening to the ultraviolet radiation.
We're still getting a dose of UVA.
But all of the UVB,
or nearly all of it,
is dissipated through the thickness of the atmosphere.
In the winter, when you are skiing in the Alps,
you may experience ultraviolet radiation.
But it's all UVA,
and, significantly, that UVA
has no ability to make vitamin D in your skin.
were bereft of the potential
to make vitamin D in their skin for most of the year.
This had tremendous consequences
for the evolution of human skin pigmentation.
Because what happened, in order to ensure health and well-being,
these lineages of people
dispersing into the Northern Hemisphere
lost their pigmentation.
There was natural selection
for the evolution of lightly pigmented skin.
Lightly pigmented skin evolved not just once,
not just twice, but probably three times.
Not just in modern humans,
but in one of our distant unrelated ancestors,
the Neanderthals.
A remarkable, remarkable testament
to the power of evolution.
Humans have been on the move for a long time.
And just in the last 5,000 years,
in increasing rates, over increasing distances.
Here are just some of the biggest movements of people,
voluntary movements, in the last 5,000 years.
people from high UV areas
going to low UV and vice versa.
And not all these moves were voluntary.
Between 1520 and 1867,
12 million, 500 people
were moved from high UV
to low UV areas
in the transatlantic slave trade.
Now this had all sorts of invidious social consequences.
But it also had deleterious
health consequences to people.
We're so clever we can overcome all of these
Well, often we're unaware
of the fact that we're living
in environments in which our skin
is inherently poorly adapted.
Some of us with lightly pigmented skin
live in high-UV areas.
Some of us with darkly pigmented skin
live in low-UV areas.
These have tremendous consequences for our health.
be careful about the problems of skin cancer,
and destruction of folate in our bodies,
by lots of sun.
Epidemiologists and doctors
have been very good about telling us
about protecting our skin.
What they haven't been so good about instructing people
is the problem of darkly pigmented people
living in high latitude areas,
or working inside all the time.
but it is more sinister,
because vitamin D deficiency,
from a lack of ultraviolet B radiation,
is a major problem.
Vitamin D deficiency creeps up on people,
and causes all sorts of health problems to their bones,
to their gradual decay of their immune systems,
or loss of immune function,
and probably some problems
with their mood and health,
their mental health.
one of these wonderful products of evolution
that still has consequences for us today.
We live in a world where we
have lightly and darkly pigmented people
living next to one another,
but often brought into proximity initially
as a result of very invidious social interactions.
So how can we overcome this?
How can we begin to understand it?
Evolution helps us.
we have the first moderately pigmented President of the United States.
(Applause)
How wonderful is that?
(Applause)
This man is significant for a whole host of reasons.
But we need to think about how he compares,
in terms of his pigmentation, to other people on Earth.
He, as one of many urban admixed populations,
is very emblematic
of a mixed parentage, of a mixed pigmentation.
And he resembles, very closely,
people with moderate levels of pigmentation
who live in southern Africa, or Southeast Asia.
to tan, to develop more pigment in their skin,
as a result of exposure to sun.
They also run the risk of vitamin D deficiency,
if they have desk jobs, like that guy.
So lets all wish for his great health,
and his awareness of his own skin pigmentation.
about the evolution of human skin pigmentation,
and the phenomenon of pigmentation,
is that it is the demonstration,
the evidence, of evolution
by natural selection,
right on your body.
When people ask you, "What is the evidence for evolution?"
You don't have to think about some exotic examples, or fossils.
You just have to look at your skin.
even though he eschewed the importance
of climate on the evolution of pigmentation during his own life.
I think, were he able to look
at the evidence we have today, he would understand it.
He would appreciate it.
And most of all, he would teach it.
You can touch it.
You can understand it.
Take it out of this room.
Take your skin color,
and celebrate it.
Spread the word.
You have the evolution
of the history of our species,
part of it, written in your skin.
Understand it. Appreciate it. Celebrate it.
Go out. Isn't it beautiful? Isn't it wonderful?
You are the products of evolution.
Thank you.
So I am a pediatric cancer doctor
and stem-cell researcher at Stanford University
where my clinical focus has been bone marrow transplantation.
Now, inspired by Jill Bolte Taylor last year,
I didn't bring a human brain,
but I did bring a liter of bone marrow.
And bone marrow is actually what we use
to save the lives of tens of thousands of patients,
most of whom have advanced malignancies like leukemia and lymphoma
and some other diseases.
I'm in the operating room. We have Bob here,
who is a volunteer donor.
We're sending his marrow across the country to save the life
of a child with leukemia.
So actually how do we harvest this bone marrow?
Well we have a whole O.R. team, general anesthesia, nurses,
and another doctor across from me.
Bob's on the table, and we take this sort of small needle,
you know, not too big.
And the way we do this is we basically
place this through the soft tissue,
and kind of punch it into the hard bone,
into the tuchus -- that's a technical term --
and aspirate about 10 mls of bone marrow out,
each time, with a syringe.
And hand it off to the nurse. She squirts it into a tin.
Hands it back to me. And we do that again and again.
About 200 times usually.
And by the end of this my arm is sore, I've got a callus on my hand,
let alone Bob,
whose rear end looks something more like this,
like Swiss cheese.
And there is probably a better way to do this.
So I thought of a minimally invasive approach,
and a new device that we call the Marrow Miner.
This is it.
And the Marrow Miner, the way it works is shown here.
Instead of entering the bone dozens of times,
we enter just once, into the front of the hip or the back of the hip.
And we have a flexible, powered catheter
with a special wire loop tip that stays inside the crunchy part of the marrow
and follows the contours of the hip, as it moves around.
So it enables you to very rapidly aspirate,
or suck out, rich bone marrow very quickly through one hole.
We can do multiple passes through that same entry.
No robots required.
And, so, very quickly, Bob can just get one puncture, local anesthesia,
and do this harvest as an outpatient.
And played around with this a little bit.
And our team members developed this technology.
And eventually we got two large animals, and pig studies.
And we found, to our surprise, that we not only got bone marrow out,
but we got 10 times the stem cell activity
in the marrow from the Marrow Miner, compared to the normal device.
This device was just FDA approved in the last year.
There will be two passes here, in the same patient, from the same hole.
This was done under local anesthesia, as an outpatient.
And we got, again, about three to six times more stem cells
than the standard approach done on the same patient.
You all know about embryonic stem cells.
They've got great potential but haven't yet entered clinical trials.
Adult stem cells are throughout our body,
including the blood-forming stem cells in our bone marrow,
which we've been using as a form of stem-cell therapy
for over 40 years.
In the last decade there's been an explosion of use
of bone marrow stem cells to treat the patient's other diseases
such as heart disease, vascular disease,
orthopedics, tissue engineering,
even in neurology to treat Parkinson's
and diabetes.
generation 2.0 of the Marrow Miner.
The hope is that this gets more stem cells out,
which translates to better outcomes.
It may encourage more people to sign up to be
potential live-saving bone marrow donors.
It may even enable you to bank
your own marrow stem cells, when you're younger and healthier,
to use in the future should you need it.
And ultimately -- and here's a picture of our
bone marrow transplant survivors,
who come together for a reunion each year at Stanford.
Hopefully this technology will let us
have more of these survivors in the future.
Thanks.
I have a studio in Berlin --
let me cue on here --
which is down there in this snow, just last weekend.
In the studio we do a lot of experiments.
I would consider the studio more like a laboratory.
I have occasional meetings with scientists.
And I have an academy, a part of the University of Fine Arts in Berlin.
We have an annual gathering of people,
and that is called Life in Space.
Life in Space is really not necessarily about
how we do things, but why we do things.
So just keep looking. Don't mind me.
So you will have a yellow circle, and we will do an after-image experiment.
When the circle goes away you will have another color, the complementary color.
I am saying something. And your eyes and your brain are saying something back.
This whole idea of sharing, the idea of constituting reality
by overlapping what I say and what you say --
think of a movie.
I've been working on these films
where we produce the film together.
I don't necessarily think the film is so interesting.
Obviously this is not interesting at all in the sense of the narrative.
But nevertheless, what the potential is --
and just keep looking there --
what the potential is, obviously,
is to kind of move the border of who is the author,
and who is the receiver.
Who is the consumer, if you want,
and who has responsibility for what one sees?
I think there is a socializing dimension
in, kind of, moving that border.
Who decides what reality is?
The show was, in a sense, about that.
It was about a space in which I put half a semi-circular yellow disk.
I also put a mirror in the ceiling, and some fog, some haze.
And my idea was to make the space tangible.
With such a big space, the problem is
obviously that there is a discrepancy
between what your body can embrace,
and what the space, in that sense, is.
So here I had the hope that by inserting some natural elements,
if you want -- some fog -- I could make the space tangible.
So look at this. Look at the girl.
Of course they have to look through a bloody camera
in a museum. Right? That's how museums are working today.
But look at her face there,
as she's checking out, looking at herself in the mirror.
"Oh! That was my foot there!"
She wasn't really sure whether she was seeing herself or not.
And in that whole idea,
how do we configure the relationship between our body and the space?
How do we reconfigure it?
How do we know that being in a space makes a difference?
why, rather than how?
The why meant really,
"What consequences does it have when I take a step?"
"What does it matter?"
"Does it matter if I am in the world or not?"
"And does it matter whether the kind of actions I take
filter into a sense of responsibility?"
Is art about that?
I would say yes. It is obviously about
not just about decorating the world, and making it look even better,
or even worse, if you ask me.
like I did here when throwing some green dye in the river
in L.A., Stockholm, Norway and Tokyo,
among other places.
The green dye is not environmentally dangerous,
but it obviously looks really rather frightening.
And it's on the other side also, I think, quite beautiful,
as it somehow shows the turbulence in these kind of downtown areas,
in these different places of the world.
it was really about showing people,
in this city, as they walk by,
that space has dimensions. A space has time.
And the water flows through the city with time.
The water has an ability to make
the city negotiable, tangible.
Negotiable meaning that it makes a difference
whether you do something or not.
It makes a difference whether you say, "I'm a part of this city.
And if I vote it makes a difference.
If I take a stand, it makes a difference."
I think, something that art, in a sense,
always was working with.
The idea that art can actually evaluate the relationship
between what it means to be in a picture,
and what it means to be in a space. What is the difference?
The difference between thinking and doing.
So these are different experiments with that. I won't go into them.
Iceland, lower right corner, my favorite place.
These are ongoing experiments.
One is an experiment I did for BMW,
an attempt to make a car.
It's made out of ice.
A crystalline stackable principle in the center on the top,
which I am trying to turn into a concert hall in Iceland.
A sort of a run track, or a walk track,
on the top of a museum in Denmark,
which is made of colored glass, going all around.
So the movement with your legs
will change the color of your horizon.
And two summers ago at the Hyde Park in London,
with the Serpentine Gallery:
a kind of a temporal pavilion where
moving was the only way you could see the pavilion.
This summer, in New York:
there is one thing about falling water which is very much about
the time it takes for water to fall.
It's quite simple and fundamental.
And as you come to a new valley,
as you come to a new landscape, you have a certain view.
If you stand still, the landscape
doesn't necessarily tell you how big it is.
It doesn't really tell you what you're looking at.
The moment you start to move, the mountain starts to move.
The big mountains far away, they move less.
The small mountains in the foreground, they move more.
And if you stop again, you wonder,
"Is that a one-hour valley?
Or is that a three-hour hike, or is that a whole day I'm looking at?"
right out there at the horizon; you look at the waterfall
and you go, "Oh, the water is falling really slowly."
And you go, "My god it's really far away and it's a giant waterfall."
If a waterfall is falling faster,
it's a smaller waterfall which is closer by --
because the speed of falling water is pretty constant everywhere.
And your body somehow knows that.
So this means a waterfall is a way of measuring space.
that has had an interest in somehow
playing around with the sense of space, you could say that New York
wants to seem as big as possible.
Adding a measurement
to that is interesting:
the falling water suddenly gives you a sense
of, "Oh, Brooklyn is exactly this much --
the distance between Brooklyn and Manhattan, in this case
the lower East River is this big."
It was also about giving the city a sense of dimension.
And why would we want to do that?
Because I think it makes a difference
whether you have a body
that feels a part of a space,
rather than having a body which is just in front of a picture.
And "Ha-ha, there is a picture and here is I. And what does it matter?"
Is there a sense of consequences?
if I feel that the space is tangible,
if I feel there is time,
if there is a dimension I could call time,
I also feel that I can change the space.
And suddenly it makes a difference
in terms of making space accessible.
One could say this is about
community, collectivity.
It's about being together.
What does the word "public" mean today anyway?
So, asked in that way,
I think it raises great things about
parliamentary ideas, democracy, public space,
being together, being individual.
How do we create
an idea which is both tolerant to individuality,
and also to collectivity,
without polarizing the two
into two different opposites?
Of course the political agendas in the world
has been very obsessed, polarizing the two against each other
into different, very normative ideas.
and this is why art and culture are so incredibly interesting
in the times we're living in now,
have proven that one can
create a kind of a space
which is both sensitive to individuality
and to collectivity.
It's very much about this causality, consequences.
It's very much about the way we link
thinking and doing.
So what is between thinking and doing?
And right in-between thinking and doing,
I would say, there is experience.
And experience is not just
a kind of entertainment in a non-casual way.
Experience is about responsibility.
Having an experience is taking part in the world.
Taking part in the world is really about sharing responsibility.
So art, in that sense,
I think holds an incredible relevance
in the world in which we're moving into,
particularly right now.
That's all I have. Thank you very much.
(Applause)
Because of what I'm about to say,
I really should establish my green credentials.
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste
the natural resources of my country,
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,
basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,
so it's the same now, 30 years later,
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.
called Whole Earth Discipline.
The dominant demographic event of our time
is this screamingly rapid urbanization
that we have going on.
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,
and that's mostly in the developing world,
where that's happening.
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree
by the size of cities.
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,
and nine times bigger.
It's qualitatively different.
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.
Well we now have a distribution of urban power
similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.
In other words, the rise of the West,
dramatic as it was, is over.
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:
1.3 million people a week coming to town,
decade after decade.
What's really going on?
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,
and it's because I never lived in one.
(Laughter)
Because in town --
this is the bustling squatter city
of Kibera, near Nairobi --
they see action. They see opportunity.
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.
The aggregate numbers now
are that basically squatters,
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,
which means they're building the world --
personally, one by one, family by family,
clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.
They even build their own infrastructure.
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.
And then gradually gentrifies.
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,
it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.
These people are valuable as a group.
And that's how they work.
"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.
Famine mostly is a rural event now.
There are things they care about.
And this is where we can help.
And the nations they're in can help.
And they are helping each other solve these issues.
You look at that lane on the right.
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"
The answer is, "Everything."
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.
It's much more interactive.
And the scale is terrific.
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.
These are people busy getting out of poverty
just as fast as they can.
They're helping each other do it.
They're doing it through an outlaw thing,
the informal economy.
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.
the gray economy --
as time goes by,
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,
or they can join the legitimate world.
We should be able to make that choice
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.
There's all kinds of activity.
a lot of services for itself,
but it performs services for the city at large.
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers
to a private, tiny, unofficial school.
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things.
such as in Sao Paulo here.
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,
In this case, supply right next to demand.
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards
that live in this lively part of town on the left
walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.
Connectivity between the city and the country
is what's going to keep the country good,
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.
This is what makes cities --
(Applause)
this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.
of subsistence farms, and head to town.
And when they're gone the natural environment
starts to come back very rapidly.
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops
to send food to the new growing markets in town.
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.
More than half.
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.
Another billion is expected.
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.
And that will determine a lot of how we function.
People get into town.
The immediately have fewer children.
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of
coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,
and the birthrate goes down radically.
here's a slide from Phillip Longman.
Shows what is happening.
As we have more and more old people, like me,
and fewer and fewer babies.
And they are regionally separated.
What you're getting is a world which is
old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,
in the north.
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,
doing new things, in the south.
Where do you think the action is going to be?
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse
than we think, faster than we think.
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,
full of runaway positive feedbacks,
hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.
Here's just a few samples.
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all
the surprises are going to be bad ones.
a great increase in climate refugees
over the coming decades,
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars
and chaos wars,
as we're seeing in Darfur.
That's what drought does.
It brings carrying capacity down,
and there's not enough carrying capacity
to support the people. And then you're in trouble.
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,
or a city planet.
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:
coal, some gas,
nuclear and hydro.
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.
And everyone will keep burning it
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.
coal and lose the climate,
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,
and maybe save the climate.
that also could help.
in the villages and in the cities.
compare their waste products.
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,
the amount of waste that would be added up
would fit in a Coke can.
Whereas a coal-burning plant,
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,
each car having 100 tons.
And it puts 18 thousand tons
of carbon dioxide in the air.
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions
of these various energy forms,
nuclear is about even with solar and wind,
and ahead of solar --
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.
Just ask the coal miners in Australia.
That's where you see some of the source,
not from my fellow environmentalists,
but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.
Well the good news is that
the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,
is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.
This is good for the atmosphere.
It's good for their prosperity.
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,
and good things like that.
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,
might serve even better.
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.
And they're selling these floating reactors,
only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,
25 million watts,
and you compare it to the standard big iron
of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,
which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.
Here's another American design that came out
of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.
They're typically buried in the ground.
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.
In terms of proliferation,
nuclear energy has done more
to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,
20 percent of electricity
in this room is probably nuclear.
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,
that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.
And I was glad to see that president Obama
supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy
when he spoke in Prague the other week.
in my view, as a biologist,
have no reason to be controversial.
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,
have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.
Despite their best efforts,
genetically engineered crops are the most
rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,
which leaves the soil in place,
getting healthier from year to year --
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil
into the atmosphere.
They reduce pesticide use.
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your
agricultural area be smaller,
and therefore more wild area is freed up.
is out of date because it shows Africa
still under the thumb of Greenpeace,
and Friends of the Earth from Europe,
and they're finally getting out from under that.
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics
met on this issue twice in great detail
and said it is a moral imperative
to make genetically engineered crops readily available.
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,
especially in government circles,
though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,
but it will be on your plate --
not this year but pretty soon,
because some harsh realizations are coming along.
This is a list of them.
There will be events,
like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,
which happened a while back.
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.
Like wars over water,
such as in the Indus.
And as those events keep happening
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"
what body is going to decide
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?
Because everybody is downstream,
downwind of whatever is done.
And if we just taboo it completely
we could lose civilization.
But if we just say "OK,
China, you're worried, you go ahead.
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.
I should say, it is more practical than people think.
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.
This one came from the sulfur dioxide
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --
cooled the earth by half a degree.
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,
that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs
who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere
would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.
That's nothing, compared to all of the other
things we may be trying to do about energy.
this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,
by atomizing seawater;
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.
A nice one, because it can happen
lots of little ways in lots of little places,
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians
who made good agricultural soil
by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon
while it's improving the soil.
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen
calls our geological era the Anthropocene,
the human-dominated era. We are stuck
with its obligations.
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,
"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline
are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."
Thank you.
(Applause)
So it was about four years ago, five years ago,
I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia, I think it was,
with a bag similar to this.
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag.
And I was saying, you don't know this molecule really well,
but your body knows it extremely well.
And I was thinking that your body hated it, at the time,
because we are very immune to this. This is called alpha-gal epitope.
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them
is the reason that you can't transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily.
Our body loves these. It eats them.
I mean, the cells in our immune system are always hungry.
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things
on the cell, it means "that's food."
Now, I was thinking about that and I said, you know, we've got this
immune response to this ridiculous molecule
that we don't make, and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff.
But I said we can't get rid of it,
because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves
found out you can't get rid of that immunity.
What if I could stick this molecule,
slap it onto a bacteria
that was pathogenic to me, that had just invaded my lungs?
I mean I could immediately tap into
an immune response that was already there,
where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it --
it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on.
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you,
like when you're getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A.,
and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car,
and then charges you for possession of marijuana.
It's like this very fast, very efficient way to get people off the street.
that really doesn't make these things at all,
and if you could clamp these on it really well
you have it taken off the street.
And for certain bacteria
we don't have really efficient ways to do that anymore.
Our antibiotics are running out.
And, I mean, the world apparently is running out too.
So probably it doesn't matter 50 years from now --
streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant --
because we won't be here. But if we are --
(Laughter)
we're going to need something to do with the bacteria.
with a bunch of collaborators.
And trying to attach this to things that were
themselves attached to certain specific target zones,
bacteria that we don't like.
And I feel now like George Bush.
It's like "mission accomplished."
So I might be doing something dumb, just like he was doing at the time.
But basically what I was talking about there we've now gotten to work.
And it's killing bacteria. It's eating them.
sort of symbolizing this right now.
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer.
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically
to a target that you have selected for it.
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don't like,
like Staphylococcus -- I don't like it in particular,
because it killed a professor friend of mine last year.
It doesn't respond to antibiotics. So I don't like it.
And I'm making an aptamer that will have this attached to it.
That will know how to find Staph when it's in your body,
and will alert your immune system to go after it.
with the little dots?
That's a bunch of mice that had been poisoned
by our scientist friends down in Texas,
at Brooks Air Base, with anthrax.
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made
that would attack anthrax in particular,
and direct your immune system to it.
You'll notice they all lived, the ones on the top line --
that's a 100 percent survival rate.
And they actually lived another 14 days,
or 28 when we finally killed them,
and took them apart and figured out what went wrong.
Why did they not die?
And they didn't die because they didn't have anthrax anymore.
So we did it. Okay?
I normally teach courses on
how to rebuild states after war.
But today I've got a personal story to share with you.
This is a picture of my family,
my four siblings -- my mom and I -- taken in 1977.
And we're actually Cambodians.
And this picture is taken in Vietnam.
So how did a Cambodian family end up in Vietnam in 1977?
Well to explain that, I've got a short video clip
to explain the Khmer Rouge regime
during 1975 and 1979.
The communist Khmer Rouge
enters Phnom Penh to liberate their people
from the encroaching conflict in Vietnam,
and American bombing campaigns.
Led by peasant-born Pol Pot,
the Khmer Rouge evacuates people to the countryside
in order to create a rural communist utopia,
much like Mao Tse-tung's Cultural Revolution in China.
The Khmer Rouge closes the doors to the outside world.
But after four years the grim truth seeps out.
In a country of only seven million people,
one and a half million were murdered by their own leaders,
their bodies piled in the mass graves of the killing fields.
on April 17th 1975
we lived in Phnom Penh.
And my parents were told by the Khmer Rouge
to evacuate the city because of impending American bombing for three days.
And here is a picture of the Khmer Rouge.
They were young soldiers, typically child soldiers.
And this is very normal now, of modern day conflict,
because they're easy to bring into wars.
I mean, from 1965 to 1973 there were
more munitions that fell on Cambodia
than in all of World War II Japan,
including the two nuclear bombs
of August 1945.
The Khmer Rouge didn't believe in money.
So the equivalent of the Federal Reserve Bank
in Cambodia was bombed.
But not just that, they actually banned money.
I think it's the only precedent in which
money has ever been stopped from being used.
And we know money is the root of all evil,
but it didn't actually stop evil from happening in Cambodia, in fact.
This is a picture of what Pursat looks like.
It's actually a very pretty area of Cambodia,
where rice growing takes place.
And in fact they were forced to work the fields.
So my father and mother ended up in
a sort of concentration camp, labor camp.
from the commune chief
that the Vietnamese were actually asking
for their citizens to go back to Vietnam.
And she spoke some Vietnamese,
as a child having grown up with Vietnamese friends.
And she decided, despite the advice of her neighbors,
that she would take the chance
and claim to be Vietnamese
so that we could have a chance to survive,
because at this point they're forcing everybody to work.
And they're giving about --
in a modern-day, caloric-restriction diet, I guess --
they're giving porridge, with a few grains of rice.
my father got very sick.
And he didn't speak Vietnamese.
So he died actually, in January 1976.
And it made it possible, in fact,
for us to take on this plan.
So the Khmer Rouge took us
from a place called Pursat to Kaoh Tiev,
which is across from the border from Vietnam.
And there they had a detention camp
where alleged Vietnamese would be tested, language tested.
that to make our story more credible,
she'd given all the boys and girls new Vietnamese names.
But she'd given the boys girls' names,
and the girls boys' names.
And it wasn't until she met a Vietnamese lady
who told her this, and then tutored her for two days intensively,
that she was able to go into her exam
and -- you know, this was a moment of truth.
If she fails, we're all headed to the gallows;
if she passes, we can leave to Vietnam.
And she actually, of course -- I'm here, she passes.
And we end up in Hong Ngu on the Vietnamese side.
And then onwards to Chau Doc.
And this is a picture of Hong Ngu, Vietnam today.
A pretty idyllic place on the Mekong Delta.
But for us it meant freedom.
And freedom from persecution from the Khmer Rouge.
which the U.N. is helping Cambodia take on,
started, and I decided that as a matter of record
I should file a Civil Complaint
with the Tribunal about my father's passing away.
And I got word last month
that the complaint was officially accepted by the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.
And it's for me a matter of justice for history, and accountability for the future,
because Cambodia remains a pretty lawless place, at times.
And she was able to return to a place
that for her meant freedom, but also fear,
because we had just come out of Cambodia.
I'm happy, actually, today, to present her.
She's here today with us in the audience.
Thank you mother.
Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify
the overwhelming complexity
and richness that we experience at the conference
in a project called Big Viz.
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches
that were made by two visual artists.
David Sibbet from The Grove,
and Kevin Richards, from Autodesk,
made 650 sketches that strive to capture
the essence of each presenter's ideas.
And the consensus was: it really worked.
These sketches brought to life the key ideas,
the portraits, the magic moments
that we all experienced last year.
What is it about animation,
graphics, illustrations, that create meaning?
And this is an important question to ask and answer
because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning,
the better we can communicate,
and, I also think, the better we can think and collaborate together.
So this year we're going to visualize how
the brain visualizes.
doesn't actually see the world as it is,
but instead, creates a series of mental models
through a collection of "Ah-ha moments,"
or moments of discovery, through various processes.
Light enters, hits the back of the retina, and is circulated,
most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain,
at the primary visual cortex.
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry,
just the simplest of shapes.
But it also acts like a kind of relay station
that re-radiates and redirects information
to many other parts of the brain.
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense,
create more meaning through the kind of "Ah-ha" experiences.
We're only going to talk about three of them.
It's on this side of the brain.
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is.
It's the "what" detector.
Look at a hand. Look at a remote control. Chair. Book.
So that's the part of the brain that is activated
when you give a word to something.
And what it does is locates the object
in physical body space.
So if you look around the stage here
you'll create a kind of mental map of the stage.
And if you closed your eyes you'd be able to mentally navigate it.
You'd be activating the dorsal stream if you did that.
is the limbic system.
And this is deep inside of the brain. It's very old, evolutionarily.
And it's the part that feels.
It's the kind of gut center, where you see an image
and you go, "Oh! I have a strong
or emotional reaction to whatever I'm seeing."
help us make meaning in very different ways.
So what can we learn about this? How can we apply this insight?
Well, again, the schematic view
is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at.
The brain processes this in parallel, the figments of information
asking a whole bunch of questions
to create a unified mental model.
a good graphic invites the eye to dart around,
to selectively create a visual logic.
So the act of engaging, and looking at the image creates the meaning.
It's the selective logic.
Now we've augmented this and spatialized this information.
Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built
in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel
where we quite literally create an infinite wall.
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas.
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery
enriches meaning.
It activates a different part of the brain.
And then the limbic system
is activated when we see motion, when we see color,
and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors
that we've heard about before.
We make meaning by seeing,
by an act of visual interrogation.
The lessons for us are three-fold.
First, use images to clarify what we're trying to communicate.
Secondly make those images interactive
so that we engage much more fully.
And the third is to augment memory
by creating a visual persistence.
These are techniques that can be used to be --
that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving.
And, by the way, this is the way in which
we develop and formulate
strategy within Autodesk,
in some of our organizations and some of our divisions.
What we literally do is have the teams
draw out the entire strategic plan
on one giant wall.

There's always a room, always a place
to be able to make sense of all of the components

No Powerpoint is used in two days.

some emerging digital technology.
And this is our great unveiling for today.
And this is an emerging set of technologies
that use large-screen displays
with intelligent calculation in the background
to make the invisible visible.
Here what we can do is look at sustainability, quite literally.
So a team can actually look at
all the key components that heat the structure
and make choices and then see the end result
that is visualized on this screen.
The first again, is making ideas clear by visualizing them.
Secondly, making them interactive.
And then thirdly, making them persistent.
And I believe that these three principles
can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems
that we face in the world today. Thanks so much.

Despite the New York Times' and Vanity Fair's best efforts recently,
they're not brothers. (Laughter)
And they were a lot of fun.

Here's Charles when he was three. So he would be 100 this June.
